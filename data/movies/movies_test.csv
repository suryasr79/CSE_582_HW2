0,a gave it a    instead of a     awful  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork . but that wasn  t enough to save it .  br    br   the  sepia  toned  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies . nothing new there . i can see there were some hat  tips to other old  classic movies . ok . no problem with that .  br    br   but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting  not something that would put you to sleep .  br    br   the story line and the script of this movie was awful  the characters two dimensional . slow moving . some of the scenes were pretty to look at  but ultimately  as a whole  it was quite boring  i couldn  t recommend it .  
1,the final season of roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy . this final episode does just what a previous comment says  it tells us that as much as we might have thought we knew the characters we did not . roseanne reaches back to season one  and tells us that this show has been her rendition of her life . she says in this final episode that she changed events and people as she sees fit . scott was not really with leon  but he existed . mark and david married opposite wives in real life  and dan died when she made him live . as events happened in her life  she changed them in her writing . don  t we all wish we could do that . don  t we all have a moment in time that we wish we could just use an eraser and change to our liking . this is what she did with the entire episode . and to another comment i would say that i don  t feel cheated  the family was real in my mind  she just changed the way that events happened in their lives . an a ending to an a show      
1,  the man in the moon  is a pretty good movie . it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects . i wouldn  t say the film was terribly original  but what is these days   br    br   the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles . i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age  and does quite a good job . jason london does a fine job as well . and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston  who did a fantastic job with his role . i really liked sam  s character  matthew trant  a lot . at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread  but in the end you really like his character . the rest of the cast was very good as well .  br    br   if you  re into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you  then you ought to watch this film . i  d suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you  d be interested in  then go for it . anyhow  hope you enjoy the film  thanks for reading   br    br    chris  
0,after a day at work  i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels . the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started . the first   minutes were enough to make me interested  but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie . if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting . all in all  don  t plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night .  
0,this movie is similar to darkness falls  and the boogeyman       but it  s also much more graphic than both  and not as good as either . it  s also slow and fairly predictable . it  s also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror . plus  we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational  inspirational sermon . really  this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything . even though it is gory  the makeup effects are not very realistic looking . in fact they look kinda cheap . aside from all that  there is some really awful clichd dialogue . and i won  t say when  but there is a point where a couple of the character  s actions were not authentic or believable  given the circumstances . nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way . once you watch the movie  you  ll know what i mean . there  s also some gratuitous nudity for nudity  s sake . it just wasn  t necessary at all . the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good . better than this movie deserves . so  after carefully weighing the evidence  id say this movie was passable  but not good . my verdict for the tooth fairy      
1,after a chance encounter on the train  a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna  discussing life and love . the primary reason to see  before sunrise   is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines . as  celine   this sexy  brainy  soulful brown  eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid  twenties . risking overstatement  celine is practically the ideal woman  unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural  unpretentious  introspective  and selflessly loving . we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak  for her sincere  intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating . further  her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing .  br    br   if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie  it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar . ethan hawke as  jessie  comes off like a vaguely appealing slob  sort of a maynard g . krebs of the nineties . attempting to appear detached and nonchalant  he sort of drags himself through certain shots . his pants fit poorly  his tee shirt is coming untucked  his wavy dark hair  his most attractive feature  needs a good washing  and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee . nevertheless  he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two  week train ride around europe  so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine . his oft  cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine  although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation . when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence  we know he is getting somewhere .  br    br   after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes  bars  and silly diversions  they agree that because they may never see one another again  they should make the most of it . jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass  looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up .  br    br   given his boundless luck in the romance department  it is especially irksome when jessie  as the very definition of a naive jerk  foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp . he contents himself with a half  baked plan  quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu  to reunite at the same spot in half a year . when the appointed time comes  you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another  perhaps even married and pregnant . for whatever reason  she probably won  t show  while jesse  who ends up working at target or  if he  s lucky  the local library  will go back to vienna  desperate to see her again  only to wind up alone .  br    br   despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion   before sunrise  is a beautiful movie . i highly recommend both it and the sequel   before sunset .   
0,from the start this film was awful  why was it that bad   if it isn  t the naked women  not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of colgate whitening   then it  s the  crazy  old guy at the gas station  who isn  t so much crazy  but more  i  m not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods    then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis . . . . apparently  without touching you . . . and this is according to the opening scene . . . . they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck  which i assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some tcp to clear it right up . then you have sophie holland who plays ally  i have never seen such baaaaaad acting  she is more of a  me me me  if i  m not having fun no  one else is  and i don  t wanna do this so i won  t  and i  m the meanest cow on the planet  i  m sarcastic  petty and if i don  t get things my way i will sulk    kind of person . . . . reminds me more of a  yr old girl  s attitude . i don  t think it  s even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch  or how low  budget the film actually was that when judd was hacking at the  locked  door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side   this film is completely laughable  if it were a spoof then it would have been successful . . . only just though  but  as a horror film is was just plain wrong    i can  t even being to describe everything that went t  ts up in this movie i would run out of room  although it was funny to watch andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom savini  s character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision   it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor  which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow  so is it any wonder they don  t get away with it   and how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened  no pain  no weakening from blood loss  nothing   but the silliest part is when all of a sudden  and i mean that literally  it  s one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs  and then lo and behold  shaun hutson picks her up . . . of course not without a line to promote his books    altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors  but suddenly  and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why . . . she  s evil herself and lures hutson to his death  then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can  even after his  dazzling  performance on why no  one should ever venture there for whatever reason . . . cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while crazy pours petrol everywhere . . . . and here endeth the film . . . . finally  my conclusion . . . . if you hadn  t already guessed by now . . . . absolute rubbish  there was no proper thought went into it at all  whoever was aiming the camera needed firing . . . and come to think of it so did    of the cast  if the right director  actors  and budget got behind this it could have been decent . but  once again  low  budget english horror films but the rest of the genre  the country  and the english film  making industry to shame    and i  m english so i  m allowed to say that   in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first      mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . all i kept thinking throughout this was  jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this  its absolute cow  s testicles    but i can  t turn a film off after i  ve started watching it unfortunately . i had to watch from dusk til dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom savini does have it in him to act well  if there was an option for     then believe me i woulda chose that  cuz this film isn  t even worth the one point i did give it   br    br   but this is just my opinion  watch it and decide for yourself .  
1,all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense . as a matter of fact this is the best movie i  ve ever seen . it  s an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best . i would not give criticism to any of the actors . that movie is the best and it will always stay that way .  
1,this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it  s kind . the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen . it treats themes like duty  guilt  word  manipulation and trust like few films have done and  unfortunately  none that i can recall since the death of the  policial  in the late seventies . the sequence is delicious  down to the essential  living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake . no such scenes are present or needed . the argument is sand honest to the spectator an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience . no  this is not miss marble . . . a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute  not just to see .  
1,let me get the bad out of the way first  james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day . really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery .  br    br   that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes . i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september   th . it is a second home to me and i can  t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city . this is the real deal  in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them . i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day . it is a shame that they didn  t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory  it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was .  br    br   conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .  
1,the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end  where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters . kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris  so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy  gershwin tunes  and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant . kelly was at his best here  it  s a little different to singin  in the rain  and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor . no wonder the sequence ended  that  s entertainment  after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by   
1,house of games is spell binding . it  s so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens . there are few movies i  ve seen that can grip you so quickly . from the opening scene this movie just gets you .  br    br   i  m trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so don  t read anymore if you don  t want to know .  br    br   i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen  bar none . from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed .  br    br   lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection  from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately . joe mantegna was also wonderful . the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices . i also loved the way the movie was filmed  in that grainy  surreal type of way  it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was .  br    br   there were a few movies i  ve seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really  house of games is completely different in it  s way . margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i  ve seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet  but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying . you know something  s going to happen but you have no idea what . and just when you think you  ve guessed what the  something  is  you realize you haven  t even scratched the surface . . . .  br    br   house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature . the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well . as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters  we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it . it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it  s conclusion .  br    br   in closing  i  d rank this   of    call it  although not my absolute favorite film  pretty high on the list   most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best  twists  i  ve ever seen as well . although i love all types and genres of movies  when it comes to movies of the human psyche  it really doesn  t get much better then this . see this movie .  
1,when i first saw  a cry in the dark   i had no idea what the plot was . but when i saw it  i was shocked at what it portrayed . when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class  i realized a second point communication issues . you see  when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain  s  meryl streep  baby  she and her husband michael  sam neill  were grief  stricken but didn  t show it . as seventh day adventists  they believed that god willed this to happen  and so they couldn  t mourn it . but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness  everyone started believing that lindy did it herself .  br    br   the point is  the wrong message got communicated to the public  and it turned people against lindy . even though this was a pure accident  it still happened . it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media  regardless of any media outlet  s political views .  br    br   as for the performances  streep does a very good job with an australian accent  no surprise there   and sam neill is equally great . you will probably get blown away just by what you see here . definitely one of fred schepisi  s best movies ever .  
1,i voted  for this movie because of some minor childish flaws . other than that  this movie is one of my favorites  it  s entertaining to say the least . the shooting scenes are ridiculous though  and i think gackt  who wrote the book  takes a little bit too much of his  matrix obsession  into it . it seems like their enemies just stands there . . . waiting to get shot at . however  this movie is touching and it always makes me cry . it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well . gackt is a superb actor i must say . . he shows so much emotion . this was hyde  s first time acting and he did okay . the role fits him . wang lee hom is absolutely great . the whole cast is what i would say  perfect for this movie . don  t miss it  you  ll regret it   
1,   the sentinel   is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie  s industry  i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are . alison parker is a model with some fame . she dates a lawyer called michael lerman  and has as a best friend  another model called jennifer . everything was great in her life  until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment .  br    br   the problem are her neighbors  who are very  very strange . suddenly alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions . but everything has a reason  and it has to do with the new house she is living . . .  br    br   i personally find   the sentinel   a very creepy movie  and along with   the exorcist   they are two of the scariest movies i already watched . when we discover that alison  s house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze  it  s also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world .  
1,an angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather . together they find common ground in the gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders . although tragic episodes  such as the highland clearances  feature in the stories  there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them . it  s all filmed in skye  so there is a double dose of beauty . the mountain scenery is breathtaking  and it  s a rare chance to hear scottish gaelic spoken . i  m english  so i had to read the subtitles  but the sound of spoken gaelic is nonetheless wonderful . the performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non  actors  in other words  you are watching the real thing  people who care deeply about gaelic folklore and history . the gaelic community  especially on skye  worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film . anyone who has the slightest interest in gaelic  folk history  folk music  oral culture  scotland  british history  multi  culturalism or social justice should go and see this film .  
1,masayuki suo  who directed this fine film  is on a role . after the decent  fancy dance  and the classic  in japan  anyway  college  sumo comedy  shiko funjatta   suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing success .  br    br   the story is engaging . we both laugh often  naoto takenaka is hilarious  as he is in suo  s two previous films  and really root for the characters . but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society  real life in japan . suo has a knack for showing real  life activities with entertaining flair . the result is a movie that will pull you in  make you laugh  make you think  and both entertain you and give you insight into today  s japan .  br    br   also look for the the main  actors from shiko funjatta  as they all appear again in various roles  from supporting characters  takenaka  to short cameos  many  .  
0,expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie  after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman  the   year  old virgin  and little miss sunshine . boy  was i wrong .  br    br   i  ll start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell . there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh  and it  s due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle  room to do his thing . he  s an undoubtedly talented individual  and it  s a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be  in my opinion  a total train  wreck .  br    br   with that out of the way  i  ll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong .  br    br   the film begins with dan burns  a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column . he prepares his girls for a family reunion  where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other .  br    br   the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie . no family behaves like this . it  s almost as if they  ve been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver . they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we  re  . it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating . touch football  crossword puzzle competitions  family bowling  and talent shows are not how actual people behave . it  s almost sickening .  br    br   another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for . observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated . what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded .  br    br   it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet . i left the theater wondering what i just saw . after thinking further  i don  t think it was much .  
1,the little girl desi is so adorable . . . i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here . it will make you cry  laugh  and believe . knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there . great cast and an overall great movie .  
0,this movie has no plot  no character development  and no budget . it really sucks to put it in short terms . since there is no development for the movie  it really can  t even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture . which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it . to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak . well it falls short here too . the girl  s reactions just seem dumb . it  s extremely easy to tell that it  s fake  honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie . they throw innards on her  but she  s asleep for most of it  so it  s just kinda dumb . the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye . but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake  with the exception of the eye . if you want a good movie about torture  go watch hostel and hostel  . not only do they both contain realistic violence  but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people . plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners  issues of morality  testing how far a person can go  human instincts vs . civilization  and many other things . plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn  t focused on the violence . these are much better choices over this piece of crap  
1,i couldn  t hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary . it was heart  breaking  disturbing  and inspiring all in one . i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives . or simply  something that will make you think . you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life . you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude . at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual . you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us . his life and struggles will make you cry  laugh  and find that life  s a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time .  
0,this  the direct  to  video death rattle of the tremors series  features sixty inspired seconds  sawblade you  ll know it when you see it  and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . tremors  was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm  on  human violence  tops . the lackluster  cliche  spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors  experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through  much less enjoy this film . if you aren  t among them  don  t bother .  
1,it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased  in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version . true   hollow man  is a remake of sorts of  the invisible man   but that  s where the similarities end .  hollow man  is an entertaining movie  period . if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible  then you shouldn  t watch movies in the first place . true  some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable  but  hollow man  manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends . kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who  along with a team of collaborators  discover the way to make animals invisible . now his mission is to make them visible again . when this team of young scientists  working  as you might guess  for the pentagon  think they have the formula for making animals visible again  kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug . after that  of course  things go wrong  as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask  so his collaborators know where he is . feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin  s character  and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator  elisabeth shue  is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team  he finally snaps . the movie then turns into a hybrid of  alien  and a slasher flick  but that  s not saying it  s a bad turn . there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace . the special effects are top notch  a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven  s films  as we get to see some  body reconstitution  sequences never seen on a movie before . if there  s anything to complain about  perhaps  is the predictability of the situations herein by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end . and the ending is a bit abrupt  but despite this  hollow man is still worth watching . if you want to know what a truly bad movie is  then waste your money on  fear dot com   with stephen dorf  or the even worse the untold  or  sasquatsh   with land henriksen  . now that is  hollow     out of      
0,horrible waste of time  bad acting  plot  directing . this is the most boring movie ever  there are bad movies that are fun  freddy vs . jason   and there are bad movies that are horrible . this one fits into the latter . bottom line  don  t waste your time .  
0,  st watched            out of    dir  walter lang   disappointing musical from a character development standpoint  in my opinion  from this much  heralded rodgers and hammerstein piece . there a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal  at times  of the king of siam by yul brynner   but the movie doesn  t really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings . i can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don  t fully understand the character  s and their situations . i know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing  but even this part didn  t stand out a lot for me . the basic storyline is about an english woman coming to siam to teach the children about upscale european things . we find out later that the king is actually the biggest pupil . there is a side forbidden romance between the king  s newest wife  played by rita moreno  a latino as an arab   come on    and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though . deborah kerr  as the main female character annie   is ok but not that convincing either . the king learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does . this is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .  
1,enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell   philo vance  playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the  thin man series  . back in the      s william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture  the famous veteran actress mary astor   hilda lake  becomes one of the suspects in a murder  suicide case where a man named  archer coe   robert barrot  is found dead and archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside . ralph morgan   raymond wrede  archer  s secretary  gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared  in the wizard of oz      . eugene palette   detective sgt . heath  appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in  robin hood  with errol flynn . always remember  the least likely actor could very well be the killer . enjoy a great classic from the past .  
1,this is a generally nice film  with good story  great actors and great songs . the cinematography was unfortunately bad . one of the film  s weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman . why  does it hurt to attempt some originality  abbas  mustan  anyone   br    br   the film is about a newly married couple  raj and priya  salman  rani  . priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy  and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother  who will carry their child . they pick madhubala  a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta . the film is not really realistic  i mean  isn  t it easier to adopt  and even if they pick a girl  does it mean the man has to sleep with her  have you heard of insemination  anyway  i guess if the writers had heard of all this  the film wouldn  t have been made  so the concept is apparently intentional .  br    br   salman acts very well . it  s nice to see him playing a serious character . but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman . come on  it  s cheesy and unrealistic . rani is just about ok she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta .  br    br   the film belongs to preity  who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance . she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally . she lives the film  emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time  partly because of her role  partly because of her magnetic and positive personality . this is one of her career  best performances . there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries . she just should do more such roles .  br    br   the film  s ending only highlights what i said above . it is tear  jerking  exciting and very well  acted . watch it for preity .  br    br       for the film        for preity   
1,the film starts out very slowly  with the lifestyle of wallace napalm  an attendant at a photo  service drop  off station . his wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson . wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department  and takes firefighting seriously .  br    br   as we watch wallace  s rather dull life proceeding  suddenly there comes something new and jarring a traveling carnival comes to town . one of its stars is wilder napalm  wallace  s brother . he  s a clown  but he has a special talent .  br    br   so does wallace . they  re both pyrokineticists or  pyrotics   people capable of starting fires through mental energy . wallace keeps his powers secret wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do .  br    br   spoiler some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant . wallace holds back from using his powers wilder wants to go public on national tv .  br    br   complicating the matter  wilder wants wallace  s wife  whom they both dated years earlier . she becomes a bone of contention  and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefight .  br    br   the film is entertaining  but not laugh  out  loud funny . i think enough of it to have a copy in my library . it  s a good offbeat film .  
0,ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles  particularly as shakespeare  s othello . critically  lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree  having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin . unfortunately  the witty banter comes off as self  conscious here  and the backstage business is overripe . mikls rzsa also won an oscar for his score  and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress  when theatrical colman breathlessly addresses her  she asks him   what are ya  some kind of nut    . otherwise  this scenario is awfully obvious  surprisingly draggy  and not very funny .     from   
0,i am  as many are  a fan of tony scott films . when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like  man on fire  . to find out that the movie it  s the furthest thing from it  the story was treading water from the get go  and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea . and the whole  arm  scene was too gratuitous   br    br   the movie is centered around kiera kinghtly  and this movie reveals that she  ll never become a movie star  the movie brought some of the worst acting ever .  br    br   i like tony scott  s direction  n all  but this takes the whole friggin cake  sorry ton   out of     
1,this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders  who  it shows  between     and      were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments . anglo  american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power . at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post  colonial states were moving away from the western orbit  it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option . instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population . the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection  and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left  the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation  and in these new circumstances  beset by homesickness  they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death .  br    br   following the passage of more than three decades  however  in recent months  and years   following the release of many utterly damning papers from britain  s public record office  one rather suspects that there was some mistake  and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public   resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state . as such  the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved . nevertheless  the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants . this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see  but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch . to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime .  
0,this movie is bad  it  s basically an overdone copy of michael jackson  s thriller video  only worse  the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint  freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling . i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie .  
0,this film is really terrible . terrible as in it is a waste of   minutes of your life . special effects are so terrible . the acting wasn  t convincing .  br    br   its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about  blood surfing  . blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a   foot crocodile interrupts there holiday . the sharks don  t look real . the crocodile is even worse  and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature  but the crocodile gets stuck and  females flash it . the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time .  br    br   a pointless  terrible film thats not worth seeing    
0,ok its not the best film i  ve ever seen but at the same time i  ve been able to sit and watch it twice    story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way .  br    br   and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling .  br    br   overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it .  
0,the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie . unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie . i have to write  more lines for my comments to be posted  but there is more than  lines of awful in this western . i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along  or just a spoof . the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic . not realistic at all . a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic  but the shooting scenes were a joke . a previous commentator thought this movie was great  and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush . this was not a democratic or republican western . it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially . i wonder if it made any money . at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students . if that was the case  then it was a great movie .  
1,ooverall  the movie was fairly good  a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes  but chuck norris did hardly anything  except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters . the movie was very similar to the events of sept .    with a bin laden  like terrorist sending a video to the president  urich  and threatening to detonate it . judson mills had some superb action roles  taking out rashid  s compound and various kick  butt roles but  there was a lack of chuck norris . judson took over most of the action  leaving joshua  chuck  with que on her computer . but  overall  it was realistic and didn  t lack the action  but only did it on mr . norris  part . i gave the film     .  
1,      for this film .  br    br   i  m a british india doctor  currently in india . the word beckham put me off   cos i  m a die hard liverpool fan  and personally think that owen is really cool . since liverpool and man utd are rivals  i was dead sure that i wouldn  t watch the film .  br    br   but then i was in delhi to meet some friends  and i had an early morning flight  so i thought   what the heck  let  s bide time by watching this film    cos it was a late night show .  br    br   what a moron i was . i should  ve seen this film the day it was released . i guess using beckham  s name was to draw audience attraction  which had back  fired in my case      but then i really can  t think of a better title for the film .  br    br   and nagra  knightley  drop dead gorgeous   and rhys  myers did a superb job .  br    br   if you hate football  dislike manchester united  or england for that matter   then this is definately the film for you . in fact  i  m just   yrs old  a psychiatrist by profession  but a kid at heart . this film has knocked  star wars  off my no .  position .  br    br   surprisingly  there aren  t very many comments on this film by indian  brits like me . i wonder why   br    br        for this film .  
1,this movie was rather awful vipul shah  s last movie was good this one was just bad although it  s a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play  avjo wahala fari malishu  made a good but slow pianful  and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it  s still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don  t work well but they  re still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch it  s still a story to take in to account and it  s good if you  re the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that  s really not needed even one bit

1,still love it   or so years after the first time i saw it  in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset . despite it  s non  association with the original  which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don  t care about   this is what cartoons should be like . just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone . i  m more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing . the music is great  and gets stuck in your head forever . . . i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another .  
1,okay  i saw this movie as a child and really loved it . my parents never purchased the movie for me  but i think i  ll go about and buy it now . i  m a sucker for pre      animated films . anyway  onto the actual review .  br    br   what i liked there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell  one of the few i  ve seen in animated films . character development existed  it  s easy to classify characters in this movie  i . e .  charlie is the selfish mutt  itchy is cynical but believes charlie  carface is obviously the relentless villain  etc .  . i also loved king gator  s song . i  ve always loved loud  annoying  flamboyant guys . this song may have been random  but it was so fun . finally  the detail of the animation was beautiful . you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful .  br    br   what i did not like the actual portrayal of heaven the way charlie reacted to it   no surprises whatsoever   made it actually seem very boring . he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end . i remember a few lines of certain songs such as  . . . you can  t keep a good dog down    . . . let  s make music forever   and  . . . welcome to being dead  but i can  t remember the majority of any of them . the songs weren  t that catchy  to be honest . whippet angel she  s annoying and that neck  augh   br    br   what parents may not like a few very scary  depending on the viewer  images of hell are shown during the movie . carface is quite threatening . beer is also implied  but not actually dubbed beer . gambling is a key element in the movie . the good guy dies .  br    br   overall i love this movie  even if it is a bit forgettable at times . the scarier children  s animations are always my favorite ones . this was created back in a time when producers and writers weren  t afraid to give kids a little scare now and then . nowadays  this probably would have been rated pg . kids under the age of   or easily disturbed kids  should not watch this . other than that  i give it     .    br    br   happy viewing   
0,hee hee hee . this movie is so bad that it doesn  t even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time . i remember the day i first saw this on mst . sun was shining  looked like a good day . then  i saw this product of rick sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy   s fest land . kevin  wussy extraordinaire  tries to impress his girlfriend  manages an assistant security guard job  fights with rakes  and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images . no plot or story is needed . obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves . an army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff  and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say   he has got some nice red shorts  . plus  i really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart . just when you think it  s over  wait until the club scum scene . ask for road rash .  br    br   i advise that after viewing this film  a good month to regain senses and sanity . and if you see rick sloane  give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called hobgoblins .  
0,minor spoilers   br    br   well i just sat up late and watched this film  mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton  s earlier work like  boyz n the hood  . however  i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived  clichd  so  called  message  movies .  br    br   the acting is mainly poor   pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors . . . take note   the situations hard to swallow   rape victim becomes overnight lesbian  . . . please    but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of . by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation  making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one  dimensional players .  br    br   not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural  sexual and political ignorance . as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems . it  s message is contradictory  resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion . as for the films conclusion i found it predictable  embarrassing  exploitative and mildly offensive . for a film called  higher learning  i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again .  br    br   if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire  american history x  . . . . unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life .  
0,light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if you  ve read the novel  then you  re probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships .  br    br   true enough  the script tries to do that  the director tries to do that  but the main cast fails miserably . maria  s acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever  her most intense moments seem almost comical . sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera . her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend .  br    br   ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse  she doesn  t seem natural at all . maria had the attitude  even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious  but she had it and her character received some credibility . and to make matters worse  we don  t have an insight on her where does she come from  how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship  how did the relationship evolve  we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to  be  there it has a content and and end  but no beginning . just like her partner maria  she has only once scene that is truly touching  the scene where she dumps maria  s character kiki .  br    br   tudor is the only person in this movie  aside from the landlady  great acting there  who manages to prove some acting talent . he has his character  s attitude and it fits him . only once or twice he seems to falter  the scene at his parents  meal  he tries to be obvious when it wasn  t necessary at all  .  br    br   i love the story  tudor chirila is ok there  the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style  but this doesn  t save the movie . too bad  the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could  ve used a movie on this theme .  br    br   oddly enough  the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no  background no  feeling  well  maria  s spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction  lesbian relationship of maria and ioana . i  m quite sorry for spending money on a ticket  i  d rather had watched it from the comfort of my room .  
0,the often  reliable leonard maltin says this is a  delightful romance  and that sanders is  superb .  maltin must have confused this movie with something else . sanders is snide and droll and superb  as usual   you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery   sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three   but dull  wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately . the storyline itself  an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief  francois eugene vidocq  who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels  is entertaining enough  but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as marie antoinette  and certainly the deplorable forever amber  which screams for a classy remake  . though  in his defense  sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character  it is all for naught . i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan  but this is      and it is one of sirk  s earliest american efforts  lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid  breast  heaving potboilers . sirk is just getting his feet wet here  and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with magnificent obsession  and hit his stride  bombarding us with such estrogen  fests as all that heaven allows  written on the wind  and imitation of life . but scandal in paris is hardly his best work  a relatively low  budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming .  
1,first  what i didn  t like . the acting was not really up to the hamlet standard . branagh was really over  the  top  doing a lot of yelling mostly . in my opinion  those actors who were not big  name celebrities generally did a better job though i would except billy crystal and robin williams .  and charlton heston  too  but i wasn  t sure if he was playing at being a hack .  a lot of the ambiguities in the play were clearly resolved one way in the flashbacks .  br    br   what i think speaks very much in this play  s favor is that it is accessible . shakespeare is hard to understand for the vast majority of people nowadays many people are not even inclined to try  because of its reputation as serious literature and its archaic english . if they see this film they will understand clearly at least one man  s interpretation of the play . they will be seeing it more as shakespeare  s audiences saw it a play with sword fights and battles  and mighty kings and nobles  murder and incest and evil schemes and ghosts   and great art  if one cares to look for it  but in shakespeare  s day most didn  t  any more than most people do now . branagh  s overacting  and his forcing of his interpretation of the story on the viewer  may detract from shakespeare  s art somewhat  but it is better that modern audiences get a piece of it  rather than nothing .  br    br   i  ve got to say one more thing though . some people are complaining that  it  s set in the   th century and that wasn  t shakespeare  s time  . well  in shakespeare  s time their costume and scenery was that of their own day for all of their plays . shakespeare may have said it  s in the days of ancient rome or medieval denmark or whatever  but he didn  t dress his characters up like they were  he used the costumes of his own time . for the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms . for example  in king john the english and french have cannons   in robin hood  s day . in julius caesar they talk of chimneys  which wouldn  t be invented for another thousand years  and in henry iv they talk about machiavelli  who wasn  t even born yet then . so i think this objection is silly   you might as well complain that the play isn  t in danish  after all they live in denmark don  t they   .  
0,what was the worst movie of       cat in the hat    gigli   mais non  i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year . badly written  badly edited  and  if i may be so bold  badly acted   the order  is the black hole of film  a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck . it isn  t even accidentally funny  like  for example   showgirls .   br    br   you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn  t going to be very smart . they renamed the movie  originally titled  the sin eaters   because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was  even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie . instead  they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there .  br    br   and  hey  what do you know  they were right  my ex  girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in . congratulations  producers  you  ve met your target market . she also liked  grease ii   so you  re in good company .  br    br   back on topic  heath plays a catholic monk from a specific  you guessed it  order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor . he has celibacy issues  possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion  much less be a celibate monk . the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy . as much as i  ve wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen  his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python  thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny . you know the sort of people i  m talking about .  br    br   if i utter any more  i would be in danger of generating spoilers . frankly  the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created .  
0,this is the only movie i have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site  and that is a significant statement from someone who likes  the attack of the monolith monsters .  this movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie . it is devoid of sex and violence  for example . i believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages . this movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained  challenged  or stimulated in any way . adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the tv while the kids watch this movie . don  t be surprise  however  if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the tv off and started a board game . as an adult who enjoys being entertained  who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism  drama  comedy  and action  all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and  or stimulate the imagination  this movie has nothing to offer .  
1,the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years . i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time    br    br   the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york  and the impression i had of  trying to be as american as possible  . . . which i think has absolutely failed .  br    br   the scenes in the back really got to my heart . the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award . she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen . in future i will watch more of her movies . great luck for me that i am a native german speaking   and only for a year in the us  so as soon as i am back i  ll buy some riemann dvds .  br    br   so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet watch it    i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet  especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain  but simply watcxh it  you will be zesty         
0,this movie is made for asian  chinese market  targeting particularly fans of jay chou  one of the biggest music star in asian .  br    br   jay chou is a very talented song writer  singer . he is mediocre as an actor  although he did appear in several big  budget productions   initial d    curse of the golden flower   . amazingly  he won both golden horse  taiwan  and hong kong film awards for  initial d  .  br    br   the supporting cast are very well chosen  which appeals basically everyone from china . the cast including many famous movie  tv actors  singers  even sport commentator  huang jianxiang from china  . however  they were not given enough time to show their talents .  br    br   the biggest mistake is that chu took over both director and writer position . he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non  coherent scripts . with his poor directing and lam story  the whole talented cast  fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted .  br    br   however  the terrible movie successfully cashed in over   million dollars  maybe even more in asian  which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian .  br    br   the bottom line is you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted  or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay chou .

1,a masterful treatment of james caine  s  the postman always rings twice  as luchino visconti  s first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war  torn italy . the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo  realist work today . a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai  who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe         star as the sensually  charged and ill  fated lovers who plot to kill her husband . unusual ending in which  although crime does not pay  one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime . excellent direction  script  acting  and cinematography . reportedly not as good as the french  le dernier tournant        but probably better than the us version       featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles . highly recommended .  
1,this is a film for entertainment i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film . i personally find this film funny  audacious  and memorable . it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess . this film was done very well i might add  in the    s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person  s sexuality . this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not  it is however about love  in all it  s strange forms . this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the    s in hollywood  or in california . pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men . women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career . bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community .  br    br   then the fantasy begins   let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have  well this movie  which in any way was better than that dismal redo  the next big thing  . perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better .  br    br   i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the    s and it still brings a smile to my lips now . i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny  tender movie  to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun . some people need to lighten up    and this is the film you should do it with   br    br    
1,i have to say that the events of     didn  t hit me until i saw this documentary . it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation . i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers . i was sick of hearing about it . when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out . it was the first time i had cried since the attack . i highly recommend this documentary . i am watching it now on tv   years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies . the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing . it was an accident  and look where it got them . these two brothers make me want to have been there to help .  
1,the only part lacking in this movie is shue  s part as the daughter wanting to follow in her  aunt  s  footsteps as a daytime soap star . otherwise it would be a perfect   .  br    br   it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script  i have to wonder if a little ad lib  ing wasn  t taking place in parts . it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you .  br    br   it  s a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once . i  d recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose .  br    br   you  ll definitely want to watch the last scene closely   nurse nan  has a little secret she  d rather not have shared with you .  br    br   if you love daytime soaps or despise them  this move pokes fun in all the right places .  
1,this is one of my favorite comedies ever . not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero  but taken for what it  s worth and not as trivializing alcoholism  the movie is simply a lot of fun . it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk  irresponsible   something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune  but only if he marries susan  chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him . arthur proposes  but then unwisely falls for linda  a waitress and petty thief .  br    br   dudley moore is perfect as arthur  the world  s most endearing drunk  whose antics are a laugh a minute . admittedly  moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role . the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed . liza minnelli sparkles as linda  and her on screen chemistry with moore is great . jill clayburgh plays susan  the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur .  br    br   however  this film is literally made by sir john gielgud  who portrays arthur  s sarcastic but moral butler  hobson . it  s obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson  s longtime employment . hobson is arthur  s best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice . the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur  s romance at all  but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant . it  s the butler you  ll remember best long after the closing credits roll .  
0,i won  t spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment . i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled  let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma . some scenes seemed promising  playing with visual dimensions  but couldn  t hold up the rest . i felt like i was stoned for the first time again  having semi  philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents .  br    br   what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights . i  d rather watch jesus is een palestijn  without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor  also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves .  br    br   gert de graff is not jean  luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be .  
0,was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie  the character  leon  is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore . some movies can get away with the sexual jokes  and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on . some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie . scary movie was stupid  and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes . the only role  besides leon  that had some humor that followed was will ferrell . the character really was dumb and that was all  the dumb humor was all that had me watching . the movie was ok  and nothing else . i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show . the skits last about  minutes  and if they can make a movie off a  minute skit  then what is the world coming to  molly shannon had superstar  cheri o  terri had scary movie  but she wasnt a leading role  and will had elf . but that was good  but he did some dumb movie  but i cant remember  and mike myers with wayne  s world . how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals  seen only one guy break through  but only in like  movies and a tv show with andy dick . but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue  funny or not . this movie is not good  but had some positive humor . what a waste of film and people  s money .  d d    
0,sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i  ve seen in a long while . rife with amazing cg and special effects  studded with an a  list cast  jude law  gwyneth paltrow  angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi  and racing along with an overused but indiana jones  esquire storyline  this should have been a great movie to watch .  br    br    should have  being the key term here  of course .  br    br   jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over  the  shoulder  heart  melting smirks  but you can  t make something out of nothing  and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can  t save the movie  s stone dialogue .  if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said   good boy  dex   just one more time  i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me .  gwyneth paltrow  as polly perkins  is nothing less than nerve grating . her nasal whining and not  quite  sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie . perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical    s comic book heroine  who knows  i expected more from her . an example of how a similar character was played  and played well  is in the late    s flick  the phantom   starring kristy swanson and billy zane . rent the movie and you  ll know what i mean .  br    br   giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film .  angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch . i  ll admit it .  in just a few short scenes  both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry  two  dimensional castmates .  br    br   the plot and steady story progression were old  boring  and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years . the pace is rapid  fire in the first half of the movie  and a snail  s pace in the second  giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film  but to figure out who the key villain is as well . the pairing is rather clichd  also  polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly  ended romance  and their story isn  t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched . when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film  nobody  s surprised  and nobody really cares either .  br    br   props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film  and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout . but sky captain  despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie  falls flat on its face . not even worth the   .   i paid to get into the theater .  
0,alright  friends  a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie  the bad as well as the good  and this movie put me to the test . i won  t mince words . this movie was bad . the story was bad . the acting was bad . the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better . indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie  why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad  the answer is  of course  that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided . i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie  except to say that the quality of the acting was  to put it politely  subpaar . a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie . otherwise . stay home  don  t waste your time  read a book  take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich .  
0, here be spoilers   br    br   the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program  now called unisol . the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before . however the government is downsizing  the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened  so he takes steps to ensure his own safety . he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem . the only one who can stop them is deveraux  van damme  .  br    br   this movie is about one thing . choreographed fighting . the story is bad  and is soon drowned in all fights . whatever happens  and wherever they go  they fight . unfortunately for this movie  it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible . normally you  re pretty sure the hero will win  but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants . not where one is indestructible and can  t lose . then the fights just become a tool to stretch time . you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes . to further lower my opinion  a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are . well  there aren  t really that lot of them  because the characters are most men  there are at least one woman unisol though   but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once . the female leads get by with this  but we also pass through a strip  club  to use a computer no less  with much more undressed women . these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent  minded male audience .  br    br   so  in conclusion  boring fights . no more  no less . well  maybe less . . .  br    br        
1,well  it  s yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film . but i  m a sucker for those so i gave it a good score . . . the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling . the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change . i  d have given it a  if it were not for the salute at the end  all in all a good movie with very good actors .  br    br    
1,i  m not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity  as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money . michael winner has admitted many times that he  s not the best director of all time  and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it  s uninspired direction  and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it . the plot is rich with mystery  and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat . she finds that she can  t afford most properties she looks at  but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price . her problems start soon after moving in  as she doesn  t like her neighbours very much . . . and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour an elderly blind priest on the top floor . . .  br    br   the cast list is truly superb  with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast . chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines  but small parts for the likes of john carradine  eli wallach  ava gardner  jeff goldblum and christopher walken  to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon  s lifeless portrayal . michael winner does a good job with his central location  as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story . the film is a little slow to start  but it  s never boring and michael winner  s screenplay provides a surprise that  s almost impossible to guess from the offset  which certainly deserves some praise . like many similar slow  burning horrors  this one doesn  t go for the money shot early on  but unlike many  the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer  and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true i  ve got to say that he does a very good job at it  overall  while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it the sentinel is one of the better films of its type  and it  s definitely a major highlight for its director .  
1,i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was . i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy  and predictable film  but i decided to put that aside when watching . well  when it was over i was just left stunned  mainly in tears   by how great the man in the moon turned out to be . this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone  and its just a fabulous film . the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon  who was so cute and lovable   and everyone else . there wasn  t anything that really bothered me  i felt the ending kinda predictable  but very well done at that . also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before  but still a great film . overall i must say i don  t to much to say about this film  not that it was bad  its just a film you either like or don  t like . i would however recommend this to any and everyone  even if you don  t like these type of films  its still an enjoyable film .  br    br    .  out of   stars  
0,this film tries to be immensely clever  and tarantino  like  br    br   before you try that though  you need solid filmic fundamentals . these include good sound  editing  set design etc . . .  br    br   lets talk about the sound in this movie . absolutely atrocious . i have never been more distracted by a sound track  ever  br    br   and before we talk about low budget  film made in chile etc . . lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been . anywhere . and more info on technique is available then ever before  br    br   the sound in this movie is plain bad . the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout  the atmos is equally terrible . i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie  which are the result of poor sound editing . the sound inside cars is awful  the sound of car doors closing is awful . the sound of the lady singing is wrong . foley is either overboard  or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up . the spaces are wrong . everything about it is wrong  br    br   and yet  not letting limitations of creativity get in the way  at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever . for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene . we hear sound when we  re not supposed to . sound edits precede visual cuts . every trick in the book is used  and yet the foundations are just not there  br    br   editing  wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts  we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc  yawn . all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard  br    br   overall the mix is crap  the sound is crap . and so  the film is crap . how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise  chile  s cinematic new wave  the best creative output that chile has to offer  i hope not  and i think not .  br    br   my theory is that chile  s more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqu content . equally  the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called  world  cinema  enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons . they likely revel in it  s trashiness . of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality  br    br   this film is rubbish . it  s all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a  .  rating . the film has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino  new wave inspired porno   
1,i don  t doubt that the critics panned this movie  especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative . this is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of abbot  costello or more recently don knotts . it won  t shake the world or change movies forever . what it will do is entertain . when all is said  done that  s the most important thing anyway . watch this movie  forget your troubles . it even has a simple  kind moral message at no extra charge . i always loved elvira  s tv show when i lived in la . she did not really steal her schtick from vampira any more than vampira did from the original  theda bara . this sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best  cassandra peterson does it best . long live elvira we need more of these kind of movies . there are never enough . the villain  william morgan sheppard  was also excellent . he exudes a wonderful refined malice . i could find no technical faults . the execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets . my profound compliments to the director  james signorelli   all his crew .  
1,the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african  american entertainers of the    s than any denigration of the entire race  stepin fetchit caricature notwithstanding  . besides who i just mentioned  there  s also frog or fish versions of cab calloway  fats waller  joesphine baker  bill  bojangles  robinson  and louis armstrong . this happy harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around . they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be . if not  they  re certainly very flattering impersonations . even the lazy  shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as  hold that tiger  plays on the score . highly recommended for fans of    s animation and jazz music .  
0, . . . this would have been what you got .  br    br   words alone cannot describe how bad this is . if you  re having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you  ll be out in fifteen minutes .  br    br   robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the   s   but he  s phoning it in here . in an interview  johnny  duncan  robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight  duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder   in fact he  s more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape .  br    br   driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al  s used car lot at below sticker price   the dynamic duo don  t put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it  s bruce wayne  s car they  re driving   in fact it  s noted by several characters throughout the serial .  br    br   the acting is wooden   the sets are cheap   the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i  m sure it read along the lines of  batman says something here  because it certainly seems like they  re making it up as it goes along .  br    br   batman  s utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets   in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts   never to be seen again . his cowl is so bad he can  t even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike .  br    br   in one scene  i am not making this up   batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods . it  s radioactive so he can trace it   the reason it  s so highly flammable isn  t explained . well  unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse   we know it  s a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out   and soon the whole place burns to the ground . thanks batman   br    br   in another scene after the batmobile is disabled  batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car   leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one  yes  you guessed it  said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds . not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city .  br    br   there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman   she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce  s house   or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood .  br    br   everything about this serial is bad   and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen . if you  re looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark   if you want entertainment  try the burton batman films  the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial .  
0,recently  i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city  olathe  ks .  of this title . it is difficult for me  being a lover of the art as i am  to report the following  but  the truth sometimes hurts  and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe  i  m using the slang definition here  worthless statements or writing  for an hour and a half  i feel obligated to share  warn  any interested parties . let  s begin at the beginning  a good place to start as always . the first   minutes are not really that bad  a couple of laughs  and decent development  but then it is downhill from there . this is the story of a woman  in her mid thirties  that  as the writer would like for you to believe  is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled . the first major difficulty occurs when if you don  t know that fact going into the movie  you won  t know it when she suddenly risks it all for  in my opinion  a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman . there is little development  drastically insufficient development  to justify her actions for the affair she has  and when it occurs  one feels  as i did  that she is just of low moral character . the word  slut  comes to mind  hopefully  they  ll let that pass the review and post the comment . this  in my opinion  is the first fatal flaw of the film . if you  re married or have ever been in love  irregardless of whether you are male or female  its going to turn you off . quite frankly  i feel that it would have made a much better  blue movie   that  s the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving . the second fatal flaw is the casting  diane lane just didn  t work for me here  and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job  believe me . the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin  the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places  conveying a subtle yet very blunt  i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate  portrayal of an emerging teen . bravo  well done . i  m not going to give the ending away  but i was disappointed  being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing . . . but an ending like that . . . . well  if that teased you enough to see this picture  don  t say i didn  t warn you  but you better look fast  if this celluloid is released  i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames . i  d say wait for the video  but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value . hmmm  dustin hoffman produced this  you think he  d learn after ishtar . this film once carried the working title  blouse man  and should have been left on the rack . if you  ve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film  give this one      minutes  the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin  if you can stomach the fact that you  ll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home  which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you  re off to the movies to see this one . that  s my two cents  for what it is worth .  
0,i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the british . the film effectively blames the people of ni as being the cause of their own troubles . it suggests that the   year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with britain  s partition of ireland and domination of its history i . e . ni was created by britain in     irrespective of the wishes of the rest of ireland .  br    br   the characters are portrayed as hapless fools  even though i despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause  maintaining their artificial privileges over the catholic community . it is a known fact that british intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war  no doubt to keep the catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism .  br    br   nineties  values about  machismo   masculinity etc are transposed on to     s belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish  psyche  which leads to violence . the stupid song from the woman in the club  old ireland of green fields . . blah . . blah . .  is given a symbolic stature  i . e . poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause . tedious  ahistorical  cheap and nasty trash . o  sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis .  
1,on mtv cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie scarface out of their dvd collection . this may give you an idea that scarface is a  gangster movie  . sure  there are gangsters and mobs in it  but that  s not the point of scarface . tony montana  al pacino  is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life . he falls in with the mob group and becomes a well  known drug lord . montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life . the classic phrase  say hello to my little friend   is in scarface . this quote is what always comes to mind when i think about brian depalmas movie  scarface . this falls under my top   favorite movies . i would rate it      out of   . definitely a movie you must see . phenomenal .  
0,it  s like a bad   s tv show got loose and tried to become a soft  core porn movie . oh my god was it bad . the plots of each character had little relevance . the plot itself wasn  t anything to speak of . something about a stalker  i guess . in the end he shoots himself  it  s not really clear  but somehow there  s a volleyball game involved . and the main character  randy  sleeps around a lot . the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van dien was in it  and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it  which were barely watchable at that . thank god i didn  t spend any money on it  but i want that hour of my life back .  
0,i wasn  t sure whether to laugh or cry . porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw . costumes  what costumes  a t  shirt with strips of black leather on it . it was marion  s clothes   or lack of them   that really got me . do the  fans  of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england . the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid  but the episode with an alien was worst of all . especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face   an old trick . the hedgehog monster was pretty funny  as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows   as if . the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over  raw  bin hood and liddle john  . the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan . . .  
0,since most review  s of this film are of screening  s seen decade  s ago i  d like to add a more recent one  the film open  s with stock footage of b     s bombing germany  the film cut  s to oskar werner  s hauptmann  captain  wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler  s fuehrer bunker  once inside  they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel  the film then cut  s to one of many conference scene  s with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer  s to  ultimate victory  while werner  s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen  s are caught up in a fantasy world  some non  bunker event  s are depicted  most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit  s and his family  s difficulty in surviving  this film suffer  s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only   year  s after ww  should not have included the actor portraying goebbels  willy krause  wear  s the same uniform as hitler  including arm eagle  goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband  the  ss  soldier  s wear german army camouflage  the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy  s of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker  it was done outside in the courtyard  and lastly  hitler  s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model      most account  s agree it was a walther ppk  some bit  s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable  this bit is shown as a cabaret skit  with a intoxicated wounded soldier  his arm in a splint  maniacally goose  stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease  belly dance  all by candlelight . . . this is actually embarrassing to watch  the most incredible bit is when werner  s captain wust gain  s an audience alone with skoda  s hitler  hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench  drugged and delirious  when werner  s character begin  s to question him  hitler start  s screaming which bring  s in a ss guard who mortally wound  s werner  s character in the back with a gunshot  this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account  werner  s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare  s his own ending  hitler  s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off  screen  the final second  s of the movie show hitler  s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner  hauptmann wust  this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film  s such as the     remake  hitler the last   day  s  or the german film  downfall   der untergang  if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story  these last two film  s are based on first person eyewitness account  s  with  hitler the last   day  s  being compiled from gerhard boldt  s autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and  downfall  being done from hitler  s secretary  s recollection  s  the screen play for  der letzte akte  is taken from american nuremberg war crime  s trial judge michael musmanno  s book  ten day  s to die   which is more a compilation of event  s  many obviously fanciful  than eyewitness history  it is surprising that hugh trevor roper  s account   the last day  s of hitler  was never made into a film .  
1,my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia . my name is eugenia so i thought ok  lets see what this is . i am so glad i stayed on the channel . what a wonderful  wonderful story . drama  sadness  some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had . i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over . give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did . i have even gotten my children          and    to enjoy it . it starts slow  however  the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story . watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos .  
0,i  m a big fan of troma but i can  t figure out why they bought the rights to this movie  it  s so boring i felt like i was watching for  hours . some where on the plot summary it says  but what satan doesn  t know he  s stuck with annoying tourists  well they didn  t seem to bother him in the movie  just me .  br    br   the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan  i like bad movie  s but it was just boring .  
0,  spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning . but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty  nobody should love that .   lucius shepard  br    br    the color purple  takes place in the deep south during the early     s  and tells the story of celie and nettie  two african american sisters . the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers  an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather . this motif  innocence interrupted by men  permeates the entire film .  br    br   the film then launches into a series of short sequences . celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather  gives birth in a dirty barn  has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson  a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly  forcing her to cook  clean and look after his children .  br    br   all these horrific scenes are given little screen time  and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie  dust cinematography  a meddlesome symphonic score  incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work . the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie  a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that  the color purple  made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes . ten minutes  he lasted a long time .  br    br   the film is often said to deal which  racism    sexism  and  black culture   but this is not true . alice walker  the author of the novel upon which the film is based  claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian . her book is a lesbian fantasy  a story of female liberation and self  discovery  which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women . for walker  the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia  black sisterhood and female independence celebrated .  br    br   spielberg  s film  however  re  frames walker  s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies . this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men . a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations  moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool . a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows  the cast comprised of lecherous men  always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins   stereotypical fat mammies  jazz bands and gospel choirs .  br    br   this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike  readily and happily accepting their social conditions . a film in which black people are over  sexed  carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions . a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible  albert lives in a huge house  and black men are completely inept . this is not the old south  this is the old south as derived from  gone with the wind   mgm muscals   song of the south   warner cartoons   halleluha   and banned disney movies . in other words  it  s the south as seen by a child raised on   s tv . it  s all so cartoonish  so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes  that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy .  br    br   of course  in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed . this reconciliation was in walker  s novel  but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin .  br    br   beyond walker  s hate letter to black men and spielberg  s bizarre caricaturing of black life  we are shown nothing of the black community . we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community . instead  spielberg  s camera jumps about  desperately fighting for our attention  one of celie  s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a  home alone  movie   every emotion over played  the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by . couple this with quincy jones  ridiculously  white  music  and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith  scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams .  br    br   problematic too is the lack of white characters . consider this the men in this film aren  t portrayed as being rough to each other  nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood . no  they are cruel by nature . and the women  whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister  persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them . a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed  rather  it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse  that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts  whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles  and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors  women unable to support themselves and their children alone .  br    br   and so there  s a hidden ideology at work here . late in the film one character tells another that since he didn  t respect his wife  she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites . the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them . ie  respect one another in your poor minority community and you won  t run afoul of the dominant white culture .  br    br        a failure to confront sex and lesbianism  inappropriate musical numbers  countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz  incongruous comic business  emphatic music cues  and wildly hyped emotionality  all contribute to rendering  the color purple  worthless .  
1,this movie  while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in     released by mgm and starring janet leigh  is still a great film . danny glover in one of his best performances brings george knox  a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper  to life . as for this movie being  stacked   how about adding christopher lloyd  his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen  a wonderful actor   joseph gordon  levitt  third rock from the sun   brenda fricker  a charming and well seasoned irish actress   tony danza  yes even he is good in this film   matthew mcconaughey  he stole the show in dazed and confused  and his role may not be as pivotal in this film  but he got exposure   adrien brody  what i said about matthew mcconaughey goes the same for adrien  except the dazed and confused part   some great character actors like taylor negron  david   tony longo  messmer   jay o . sanders  ranch wilder   neal mcdonough  whitt bass  and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances  ben johnson  hank murphy  the owner of the california angels   and the rest of the cast does a great job  plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone  i don  t care what recesses of depression you  re in . i loved this film as a kid  and it brings back memories when i watch it today . i need this on dvd . i recommend it to any parent who  s looking for something their kids have not seen  and everybody else  for that matter .  
1,movie  comedies  nowadays are generally    minutes of toilet humor  foul language  and groin  kicking . modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator  the undemanding and slow of brain . sure  an occasional good comedy will come along  but they  re becoming rarer all the time .  br    br    mr . blandings buildings his dream house  shows what     s hollywood was capable of  and it  s just screamingly funny . jim and muriel blandings  cary grant and myrna loy  decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs . the film follows their story  beginning with house hunting trips  the house  s riotous construction  all the way to the finished home   with its  zuzz  zuzz water softener  .  br    br   grant and loy are perfect for their roles  of course  grant is particularly funny as he watches the house  s costs zoom out of control  . however  the film is stolen by the blandings  wise attorney  played to perfection by melvyn douglas . managing to steal every scene he  s in  douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis . reginald denny as the blandings  harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful .  br    br   i  ve watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh . i think it  s a good film to watch when you need a lift  whether you  re building a house or not .  
1,shocking  well  made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces .  br    br   small town doctor tries to discover who  or what  is committing a series of violent sexual murders .  br    br   incubus is a tight mystery  with some horrific murder sequences  that builds to an off  beat and eerie climatic twist . the murder scenes are intense and gory  so this isn  t a film for the squeamish  the direction of john hough  along with a bizarre music score  combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film . it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well . nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight .  br    br   the cast isn  t bad either . the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town . also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter  helen hughes as the town historian  and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen .  br    br   all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re  discovered and re  evaluated .  br    br    out of   
1,possible spoilers not sure  br    br   while watching the lion king      i couldn  t help but have mixed feelings about the whole film . it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and   minutes . but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did . the story  for those who haven  t read the other reviews  is about how timon and pumbaa meet  and how they affect events in the original lion king .  br    br   there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie . my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba . however  for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original . i can never look at the  circle of life  or  can you feel the love tonight  sequences the same way again  i  m okay with the  i just can  t wait to be king  sequence  .  br    br   the voice talents are excellent . nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job  as do matthew broderick  the guy who does rafiki  and the hyenas . even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me . but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu  he literally had only  lines  and neither were very necessary . the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent  although you still can  t hear timon  s mom  s voice and not think of marge simpson .  br    br   there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original  the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end . how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas   br    br   as for the dvd itself  you can  t help but feel that for a  disc set  the special features are especially lacking . they could have easily fit a commentary  or another aspect ratio on the  st disc . i enjoyed the  who wants to be king of the jungle  game  even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i  ve ever seen . some of the questions are actually difficult .  br    br   overall  a good movie  though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk  .  
0,wow . i went to the video store tonight because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie and i found this gem . i looked at the cover and i thought it looked like just the movie for my mood . i brought it home and put it on .  br    br   this movie was not the b horror movie that i had in mind . this was much worse . i wanted a bad movie but what i got  i didn  t know that crap like this existed amongst man . this movie seemed like a  year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it .  br    br   i am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies . he needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs .  br    br   if you are thinking about renting this or buying it . i will tell you the same thing that i would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide .  don  t do it  it  s not worth it   i really have nothing nice to say about this movie . don  t do it   
1,excellent film . suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout . has not been shown on american tv for a decade . one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack . you will find others . hope they soon put it on tape .  
0,thank god  i didn  t waste my money renting it but i downloaded it  this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life  fg visual effects  unnecessary gore and nudity  far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others . there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie . ok if you get time after reading this comment  please check out the director  s  ulli lommel  profile . after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this  i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between  and  . and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him  but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence . even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie .  
1,this is a bit long   hours    minutes  but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it . in other words  a lot of ground to cover .  br    br   it was soap  operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments  too  capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film . that was astounding to view . considering this film is about   years old  the special  effects crew on this film did a spectacular job .  br    br   paul muni and luise rainer were award  winning actors in their day and they don  t disappoint here  both giving powerful performances . the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them  like walter connolly  just don  t look real . i  d like to see a re  make of this movie with all  asian actors  not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible .  
1,i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies  especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side  and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie  but there are parts that are very serious  and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi  function actor .  br    br   as for the rest of the cast  i was happy with jennifer aniston  s acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell  his limited scenes are very funny  especially in the anchor scene .  br    br   overall  i would have to rate this a  . good acting  funny script  and some very serious situations make this a very good film .  
1,one of the better vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than michael curtiz . this time around a generally hated financier is found dead  shot in the head  in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor . philo vance  hearing of the situation while about to set off for italy  decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide . william powell is as affable a philo vance as you will find . he never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does . powell is aided by a host of very talented actors  some first  rate character actors and actresses like mary astor as a niece that hated her uncle  ralph morgan as the dead man  s secretary  paul cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier  arthur hohl as a mysterious butler  helen vinson as the next door kept blonde  and two really good performances by james lee as the chinese cook and portly eugene palette as a wise  cracking police detective . add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by etienne girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal . it is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make the kennel murder case a fast  moving  fun mystery .  
1,it  s hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn  t enough words to give this magnificent  stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves . they should make this the official and only true real hamlet  movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh  s  hamlet  .  br    br   it  s a perfect  complete version of the play  potent  massive  earthshaking first  class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of . they  ve packed over a dozen of world  famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career . every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction .  br    br   the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses . branagh is phenomenal in the leading role . his sharp  irresistible performance is the only one of it  s kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history . every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end . branagh  s version of  hamlet  is among the ten best motion pictures ever .  
0,the show  s echoed  bubbling  sound effect used to put me to sleep . a very soothing show . i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril . i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs  florida . i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there . i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge  of  the  seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother  s house . . . imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads . i thought  flipper  had better undersea action . of course  he had the advantage of being in his natural environment .  
1,this movie is the best film ever . i can  t remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me . with a tear in my eye  i admire this movie . it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues  music  acting  story  plot . a story of friendship  courage  kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar . little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson . they were not conventional in real . every scene they were together was priceless . the camera work is flawless and grips you . the acting is inspired . xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks . renying zhou  doggie  looks pretty and played her character very well . zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great . he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well . if you have  t this movie  try it once  do watch it .  
1,i enjoyed this film . it was lighthearted  delightful  and very colorful . you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor . there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film . every scene is packed full . the choreography was great . gene kelly is a wonder . he is so talented . the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed  and perfectly designed . he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else . the last section of the film  the grand dance sequence  is very impressive . what makes this film very special is gershwin  s music . few american composers have had a better gift for melody . i very much enjoy gershwin  s music . it is enchanting . ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers . he is so witty and charming . this was a highly entertaining film .  
0,let  s see  here are the  highlights  of the brain machine   establishing shots of a pool and a house   establishing shots of a nondescript office building  countdowns by a bland technician  close  ups of a menacing guard and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high  tech experiment .  br    br   various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of     and the release date given on the dvd box of     . that  s an easy one to explain . this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years  until someone dusted it off  thinking it fit in perfectly with the post  watergate mood of distrust in government . after seeing the brain machine now  my only wonder is that it ever got released at all   
0,firstly  there are some good things about this film  but it  s all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie . in the advertising of this movie  that i  ve seen  a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it  but she  s a poor actress  and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be  not that that has anything to do with the movie  . and what  s with that look she gives everyone  perhaps it  s part of the character  but like i said  the acting . . . still  the writing is fine . you know who it is all throughout the movie  and you can almost predict what is about to happen  but not in an irritating way . i think the book it  s based on is probably good  judging by the plot line  but next time i  ll read the book to find out rather than watch this .  
0,i rarely write a negative review for this site  but this time felt complied to . night listener is without doubt one of the dullest films i have ever seen .  br    br   there was nothing happening in this film what so ever  i didn  t care for any of the characters  didn  t buy in to the whole mystery type plot  didn  t care how it ended . . . . nothing .  br    br   there is no comedy  no action  no thrills  no suspense  nothing . the highlights include  no spoilers  there  s nothing to spoil   a man climbing through a window  a dog barking outside a hotel room  a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it  s horn .  br    br   i really enjoyed  one hour photo  and hoped for a similar eerie role from williams  but alas was sorely let down . what  s more disappointing is that i  m sure there is a good film in there somewhere  the idea was interesting and i should have felt sympathy for the characters  but it just didn  t work for me .  br    br   i might even have given it     but that score is reserved for the remake of the producers  
0,is it a coincidence that orca was made two years after jaws  orca isn  t exactly a  jaws rip off  but it is obvious that it tried to profit from jaws  s success . first of all orca in my opinion was a bad movie  not terrible but definitely not good  average at best .  br    br   the plot is basically a male killer whale  orca  after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge . i couldn  t stand to watch this movie again . the direction of this film is poor and when compared to jaws it looks like the director  producers  and writers were almost talentless .  br    br   as for the acting  it was very average and believable  however the actual characters aren  t the least bit likable . the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good .  br    br   the violence is confusing  bloody  and not recommended for more sensitive people . the music is overdone and very loud  drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times . i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale  killer whales don  t mate with only one mate as depicted in orca  .  br    br   overall this movie was bad  poor in my opinion  because of the reasons listed above . some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so i  m not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it .  br    br   my rating  .      but for its concept possibly a       
1,acidic  unremitting  and beautiful  john schlesinger  s masterpiece is no less effective today than   years ago  when american life was even more disorienting . the film probably could not have been made at any other time in history  because so many upheavals were taking place in the late     s final dissolution of the great american west  the intensification of war in vietnam  and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety .  br    br    midnight cowboy  is widely known as the only academy award  winning film to garner an  x  rating  but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art . while this film  from the novel by james leo herlihy  has much to say about the erosion of american life  it transcends    s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras . the two main characters  in fact  are standard antiheroes  men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world .  br    br   the initial focus of  midnight cowboy  is on    year  old joe buck  a physically imposing texas native played by jon voight . in the opening scenes  we follow joe  s bus trip to new york city  where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents  the ability to pleasure women  and earn his fortune as a hustler . we learn upon his arrival that joe is laughably nave in the sex trade . garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as  one hell of a stud   the young texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman   a sickly con man and petty thief from the bronx . ratso  who is short  thin  and with a limp  proves of little monetary help to joe . they quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months  joe and ratso shiver in a condemned manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names . it is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them  the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds .  br    br   throughout the film  joe hearkens back to earlier years in texas  including life with his grandmother sally  ruth white   who served as guardian his harried relationship with  crazy  annie  jennifer salt   a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which joe and annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair . very much of its time   midnight cowboy  strings together a wild array of flashbacks  dream sequences  and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds . for every moment of understanding we gain from joe and ratso  more questions about their lives are generated . both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until ratso falls into the throes of illness and joe finally senses a purpose for being alive . this revelation pushes  midnight cowboy  to its conclusion  a rather hopeful one in a very grim story .  br    br   while joe and ratso badly need some luck  the direction of john schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of waldo salt  s screenplay in allowing voight and hoffman to thrive . their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast  which features sylvia miles  brenda vaccaro  and members of the andy warhol clique  offers itself as an essential part of the storyline . the flashback sequences involving voight  ruth white  and jennifer salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost .  br    br   any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film  thanks to the excellent cinematography of adam holender   the boy who could fly    smoke   and editing by hugh robertson   shaft   . the visuals of  midnight cowboy  work with its soundtrack  assembled by john barry  as a cohesive unit  sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades . the lead song everybody  s talking is sung by nilsson  which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase . the memorable harmonica theme is played by jean  toots  thielemans .  br    br    midnight cowboy  has been released in a two  disc collector  s edition by mgm  ua  which contains expanded features and commentary . also available is a     dvd release  used for this review   which offers dual widescreen and standard format with  .  dolby digital sound enhancement three  language subtitles and closed captioning french  dubbing   a theatrical re  release trailer  not the  original  as advertised   and an eight  page production booklet . both dvd editions contain a   th anniversary restored version of the film  showing its original brilliance . well  deserving of its three oscars  best picture  schlesinger  waldo salt  and additional nominations  voight  hoffman  sylvia miles  hugh robertson    midnight cowboy  will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics .  br    br     out of   
1,although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly  and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff  you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show . in american in paris  he choreographs some outstanding numbers  some which stall the plot  but are nonetheless amazing to look at .  check out gene kelly  s  getting out of bed routine  for starters   br    br   gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris  he stayed there to paint  soon he is a rich woman  s gigolo  but he really loves someone else  hoary story sure  but the musical numbers save the show here  i really loved georges gutary  s voice work in this one . his  stairway to paradise  and his duet with le gene on  s wonderful  is  s marvelous  . oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave . all in all  a pretty good  but not dynamite movie .  
1,well  here  s another terrific example of awkward    s film  making  the rudimentary premise of  what  s the matter with helen   is quite shocking and disturbing  but it  s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion  in the hands of any other movie crew  this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale  but with director curtis harrington   whoever slew auntie roo    and scriptwriter henry farrell   hushhushsweet charlotte   in charge  it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres . the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific  but there  s a lot more to experience  like love stories  a swinging      s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap  dancing  the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique . we  re literally catapulted back to the      s  with a sublime depiction of that era  s music  religion  theatrical business and wardrobes . following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life  imprisonment for murder  adelle  debbie reynolds  and helen  shelley winters  flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls . particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment  as she falls in love with a local millionaire  but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia . she only listens to the ramblings of a radio  evangelist  fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies . the script  although not entirely without flaws  is well written and the film is adequately paced . there  s never a dull moment in  what  s the matter with helen   although the singing  tap  dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot . but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters . she  s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who  s about to snap any second and  especially during the last ten minutes or so  she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers  jason voorhees  and michael myers  combined  there are several terrific supportive characters who are  sadly  a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential  like michal macliammir as the cocky elocution teacher  agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies  house . there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us  but particularly the set pieces and costume designs  even nominated for an oscar   are breathtaking .  
1,if you love the thin man series  you will love this movie . powell  s character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles . there are even dogs . . .  br    br   the chemistry between powell and astor may not be as fabulous as powell and loy  but it isn  t half bad .  
0,i read that  there  s a girl in my soup  came out during peter sellers  s low period . watching the movie  i  m not surprised . almost nothing happens in the movie . seemingly  the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie it doesn  t . the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything . maybe i haven  t seen every movie about middle  aged to elderly people trying to be hippies  but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name .  br    br   all in all  both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this  so don  t waste your time on this . pretty worthless .  
1,i just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers . . . cab calloway  bessie smith   not josephine baker or sophie tucker  who was white   thomas  fats  waller  bill  bojangles  robinson  stepin fetchit  notwithstanding  louis armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed  cotton club  in harlem . true . . . stereotypes are there  but this was the way it was . . . and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature .  br    br   harmann  ising cartoons tended to be more  cutesy  and more upscale   after all . . . we are talking about m  g  m  than the standard animated short done over at warners  paramount  universal  fox  rko or lowly columbia . even disney  s very early mickey mouse had loads of barnyard humor before uncle walt cleaned him up just before he went  technicolor  .  br    br   disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well . . . for example       s silly symphony  woodland cafe  . but we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place .   years from now . . . clips of the simpsons  family guy  and south park will be also scrutinized  analyzed . . . and even vilified by future viewers .  
0,i remember going to see the movie in the summer of    with my parents  and being pretty into it at the time . of course  i was seven at the time .  br    br   right before the jackson movies came out  my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic .  br    br   ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid  way through the animation process for this movie  and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production . since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping  the animation technique for people on a budget  this is saying something . much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word . there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen  with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them .  br    br   because of budget constraints  the movie   already a compression of  the fellowship of the rings  and part of  the two towers    was pared down even more . what you get is sort of like a film  strip version of the cliff notes of the books .  br    br   its not all bad  though  the animation brings a warmth to it  that i found lacking in the jackson movies . its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding .  br    br   this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came . several years later  a half  hearted half  hour long tv special was aired  which was meant to wrap things up . all i will say about that is that it was a musical .  
1,this movie was made in      but it still rings true today . very  very funny . it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it  builds  from there . anyone who has ever built a house  will find this movie very endearing . great cast . cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film . this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the    s . . . . clothing  architecture and family life . many references are made to the cost of things  and those comparisons to today  s costs are pretty amazing . i can  t imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely . i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it . a true classic .  
0,i rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad     version i saw as a kid . it was not . i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was marginal acting  poor character development  and most of all  failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog . in this version . . . the  dog of flanders  is just a cute  aside  to the movie . get the     version   
0,i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is . i was sold on the promise of action  with segal and stealth aircraft  which normally make for an entertaining action movie . i can honestly say i  d rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again . the acting was so awful that it was almost funny . the story was insanely weak  with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an f    through them . the script was so poor  if i found out that a   year old wrote it i shouldn  t be in the least surprised . the direction and production is so amateur  i wouldn  t even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video . utter utter drivel . those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art  and they should be ashamed of themselves . steven segal should never ever show his face in public again  i can  t imagine what made him agree to star in this  the worst film i have seen in my entire life .  
1,hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film . the plot of the film  involving two boxers fighting over a girl  is straight  forward drama without much to recommend it . hitchcock  s talent  though  is found in his stunning use of images . nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols . especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer . he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know . the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point  of  view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was . the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women . the object of the boxers  desires is driven by money and lust  not reason or love . the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships . all in all  the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock  s early work and his development as a visual storyteller .  
1,best show since seinfeld . she  s really really funny . her total self centeredness  the hulking gay stoner neighbors  the departures into song or cartoons  make this the freshest show on tv . one of the few shows i make point of watching . the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore   oh wait now that you  re close you do look old  turns face with finger and walks away lol   the cough syrup overdose  sleeping with god  it  s all so funny or so stupid it  s just a lot of fun . the shows weak points are her sister and the cop  only because they  re too darn normal   i really can  t wait until the next show  something i haven  t felt for any show in a long time .  
1,having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons  i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference .  br    br   though the themes are crusty and stale to today  s viewers  it is by no means a crumby waste of time .  br    br   though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse  the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough .  br    br   as noted by another reviewer  it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy  sit back and loaf idly through the film .  br    br   i think this short  bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it .  
1,kurt russell is so believable and the action so non  stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest  to  goodness important themes overcoming fear of the stranger  learning to rise above early conditioning  the strength that love and friendship can bring  etc .  in the storyline . this is so very rare for a  guy  s action flick  that even i who thinks most a  a is violent pap liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know . . . . . it  s a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action  adventure box office hits   it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non  stop action moments . i  m afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it . anyone under   probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi  layered  multi  themed beauty or not care about it . this film could convert anyone who avoids a  a as mindless violence . if a guy takes his lady or rents it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film he  ll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks .  
1,a lot of talk has been made about  psychological westerns   but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre . it has big name stars who perform very well  but it is the director who makes this such a good movie . stewart granger loses his british safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the west as one of the best . robert taylor plays the upstart  in contrast to the usual young upstart  taylor  s character is middle aged  too   who wants to slaughter buffalo  and lures granger into business with him . they hire two other big name actors  lloyd nolan and russ tamblyn  into being their skinners . granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed  knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct  knowing if they become extinct  the native american way of life will greatly suffer . taylor soon reveals a sadistic side  but it is a realistic saidism  unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film  created by nerds and dorks . he is insecure  and needs human companionship . still  he won  t stop at murder . the end pits the two against each other  with a startling conclusion . the psychological effects of what they  re doing are well depicted .  
1,horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre  lover to watch a film  and  even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci  fi  horror gem . while lambert hillyer  s  the invisible ray  of     does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff   frankenstein   bride of frankenstein    the mummy   . . .  or lugosi   white zombie    island of the lost souls    dracula   . . .   or both   the black cat    the raven   . . .   this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing . compared to other universal horror pictures  the storyline seems a bit silly  but in a delightful manner . karloff and lugosi  of course  shine as always  and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography . karloff plays dr . janos rukh  a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope  and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago . stunned by rukh  s invention  the celebrated french scientist dr . felix benet  bela lugosi   invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor . in africa  rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike . . . it is somewhat odd that karloff  who was in fact british  plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi  who was hungarian  plays a french scientist  but they are both excellent as usual . as far as i am concerned  these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory  and i am sure they would have made something out of it  either man is an icon of the horror genre  and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre . by the way  this is one of the few films  if not the only one  in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff . frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh  s beautiful young wife . the rest of the performances are also good  if not particularly worth mentioning . other than the casting of karloff and lugosi  the film  s greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography  as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline . my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi  and for his role to have a bit more significance . he is fantastic as always  but his role could have been bigger  and more sinister . otherwise   the invisible ray  is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror  sci  fi cinema  and a must  see for all my fellow lugosi  karloff fans .  
0,repugnant bronson thriller . unfortunately  it  s technically good and i gave it      but it  s so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it  entertainment  . far more disturbing than a typical slasher film .  
1,i often wonder why this series was slammed so much . i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed . i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves  that is if they ever issue it . many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things . maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued . sally phillips  simon pegg  peter serafinowicz and not least julian rhind  tutt of the hugely successful green wing . the writers graham linehan and arthur matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age . anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn  t be capable of writing something not worthy of publication . if it is ever issued i will certainly buy it .  
0,to compare this squalor with an old  low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old  low budget porno flick . the animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions . the synopsis on the back of the dvd case says in part   gripping retelling of the btk killer  s reign of terror .  this is not a retelling . a retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why . none of these things are true . i  m an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly  this is not one of them . this isn  t even about the btk killer . save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent dahmer instead . that serial killer movie is accurate and true . however  if you just have to see this movie for yourself  check it out for free at your local library and even then  you  ll still feel cheated .  
1,the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly  s  i  ll take you there  is not overt  but clearly has ties to his work  shelly has acted in two of hartley  s films  . not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative  but the hyper  stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light . though this film is not ironic on the whole  thank god   the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss . with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies   i  ll see you there  is a great indie  film that doesn  t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion .  br    br   the film begins with bill  s life falling to pieces . not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home  but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat . all washed up  bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy  played by the director adrienne shelly  brings him all kinds of surprises a self  help book and a  date  for her traumatized brother .  br    br   the unwilling bill tries to refuse  but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice . no doubt bernice  s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to  rebound  with her . however  her pseudo  hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date . and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him  forcing herself upon him . to what end  we are not aware . . . except for maybe the fact that she is psycho .  and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy    br    br   aware that bill desperately wants to see rose  bernice offers her car  but on the condition that he take her somewhere first . on the way  she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun  a pinkerton detective  no less  . an imbroglio of angst  resentment  redemption  passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose . . . of course  with a few stops along the way .

0,what can i say about this film other than  don  t see it  . i waited and waited and waited for someting  or anything  to happen and it just didn  t come . watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie . what are they doing  are they solving a mystery  are they gathering clues  possibly  it  s just hard to tell . at the end of the movie  after a lot of radio signals are decoded  illegibly on some sort of pet monitor  and this guy gives some lectures  the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible . some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth  i guess they don  t like sharing the wealth  . my guess is they finished filming and saw their   minute work or art  garbage   and decided that they  d let the editing crew turn it into an   minute feature film . watch at your own peril  it  s not even funny because it  s so bad  it  s just bad .

1,well  what can i say  other than these people are super in every way . i quite like sharon mcreedy  i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of  discs   episodes  i did not realise that they had made so many  i also think that it is a great shame  that they have not made any more . i wish that i got given these powers  imagine me  being knocked off my cycle  somewhere and being knocked out cold  then waking up in a special hospital . later on  i discover that my body has been enhanced . just like richard barrat . these stories are   minutes of pure action and suspense all the way  you cannot fight these  people  as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry . the music is well written  and to me  puts a wonderful picture of  super beings in my mind  the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats  improved sight  improved hearing and touch . and the strength of   men for richard and craig and the strength of  women for sharon . who i thought was beautiful and intelligent . when i was a boy  i had a huge crush on her     now i can see why  on my dvd set . the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series . i also thought that trymane was a good boss  firm but he got things done

0,from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer  bad acting  even peter falk can  t find his way   finding john christmas  is better left lost . ms . bertinelli  s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co  stars  william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah . jennifer pisana as soccoro  the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing . but who can blame them with material like this . michael j . murray  s script is juvenile at best .  br    br   each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen . films like  miracle on   th street   ernst lubitsch  s delightful  the shop around the corner  and  of course the     version of  scrooge  . there  s frank capra  s classics  it  s a wonderful life  and  meet john doe  . hey  forget the classics . what about  home alone  or  home for the holidays  with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr .   br    br   my present to you is by way of advice . your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding  finding john christmas  . merry christmas   
1,    pick up never got the respect it should have . it works on many levels  and has a complicated but followable plot . the actors involved give some of their finest performances . ann  margret  roy scheider  and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals . notable too are vanity  who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows  and kelly preston  who  s character will haunt you for a few days . anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .  
1,this movie was not so much promoted here in greece  even though it got good actors  great script and rather good photograph was not a so called  blockbuster  movie in my country . the movie itself is very powerful  it  s about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home  village after been released from a  yo prison time  drugs  the end is rather sad . . . . mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well . . . lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency . . .  out of   because very few greek movies can make such an impression   
0,this bomb is just one  explosion  after another  with no humor and only absurd situations . really  pyrotechnics to the extreme . reality is not one of its strong points . i give it a  out of   . i would have made it a zero but that option wasn  t permitted . sorry  but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles . but then at times we all need to have money . and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars . nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey . but if that was a turkey  this movie then is not even a gizzard . i wish i could say   give me back my money  . you can bet i would if i could . but that is the trouble with premium services  the subscription variety .  
0,as an engineer  i must say this show  s first season started out very promising . most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible  and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge .  br    br   but after the first season  the show started degrading  heavily . most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science  technology for real .  br    br   the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode  but in the end  this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show .  br    br   if you are gonna watch it  go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . thereafter i would not waste my time . myself  i gave the show up midway through season  .  br    br   season    stars season    stars season    stars  br    br   let  s sum that up to  stars . since charlie doesn  t know his math anymore  i won  t bother with the correctness of mine either .  
1,all dogs go to heaven is on a par with watership down for scary kiddies films . both were dark and pretty sinister  but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have . this was one of my favourite films as a kid . i was in love with charlie and at the tender age of about five or six  i  ll admit . . . i had a crush on a cartoon dog . all dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad charlie and his partner in crime itchy . the story starts with charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling . of course  as a child  i didn  t understand the concept of this film . i loved the songs and the animation but as i  ve got older i do begin to wonder why i wasn  t disturbed by this film as a youngster . it deals with pretty adult themes    gambling  murder  hell and prison but in a world of goody  goody disney films  it  s something every child should watch once .  br    br   yes  there  s some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when i was little  but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents   
0,i went to see this film with low expectations  but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film . sadly  that  s about all i got . the story covers familiar territory  the high school reunion   but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well  worn theme . though the quality of the acting was good overall  the content of the film was appalling . the sexism of the film was blatant   women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married  procreating or both  though this was couched as a post  feminist choice  . worse still was the racism   the shrill jewish mother  the black man who still lives at home   and gratuitous cruelty  tormenting the class geek  . we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo  and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen .  
0,spoilers i guess .  br    br   the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie . i just couldn  t get over it . and what is wrong with mark wahlberg  s character  if i suddenly found myself crashed  landed on a planet full of talking apes  i  d be all like   aaaahhhhhhh    run for your lives  the monkeys have inherited the earth   but he  s all like   talking apes  okay . next   that  s pretty jaded i  d say . he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis . besides that  this is rick baker  s best work yet . this film is a true testament to how far we  ve come in the monkey makeup field .     .  
0,this was another obscure christmas  related title  a low  budget mexican production from exploitation film  maker cardona  night of the bloody apes        tintorera          which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the u . s . by k . gordon murray . judging by those two efforts already mentioned  cardona was no visionary  and  this one having already received its share of flak over here  is certainly no better  the film  in fact  is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era  but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color  which  in view of the prominence of reds  apart from st . nick himself  the devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout  was essential  . anyway  in a nutshell  the plot involves satan  s efforts to stall santa claus  christmas eve rendezvous with the earth  s children there is  however  plenty more wackiness along the way to begin with  our portly  white  bearded and chronically merry man  in  red lives in a celestial palace who  apart from accompanying toy  maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing  laboriously for the whole first reel   in their native tongue  visits merlin  the famed magician at king arthur  s court  here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child  like hopping and mumbling gibberish   once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible  by the way  the wizard  s anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr . frankenstein in son of dracula           incidentally  by this time  he always seems to have gained some excess weightso santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney  the devil  s antics  enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up  to hold up st . nick  s delivery program  then  is perfectly puerile indeed  their tit  for  tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel  hardy routine more than anything  to pad out the running  time  we focus on three sets of children one  the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company  projected as a wish  fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra  large packages    a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own  the horned one first tempts her to steal one  then invades the little one  s dreams  to no avail  and a trio of brats who  egged on once again by satan  think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves . there is definitely imagination at work here  but it is applied with little rhyme or reason  while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment  unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure  well at bay   
0,i do have the guts  to inform you to please stay away from dahmer   the biographical film based on the real  life story of the grotesque serial killer . dahmer  strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject . jeffrey dahmer  who murdered over   young males and ate some of their body parts  was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation . however  the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful dahm  project . this is not an easy film to digest  even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery brainsadillas  appetizers or even some real  life mr . potato skins  .  failure  
1,although this was obviously a low  budget production  the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing . one of walken  s few musical roles to date .  he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well  watch for the cartwheel   also starring jason connery . a great children  s story and very likable characters .  
0,  iedereen beroemd  has everything we can expect from a straight to video  movie . it  s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star . the only thing he needs is to get her on stage  surrounded by cameras and reporters . a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail . the problem with the movie is not the basic plot  but how it is made . everything is supposed to be funny  but it isn  t . it is trivial and clumsy  the characters are shallow  and the end  sequence is totally without climax or emotion . the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing  but only at how pathetic the whole set  up is .  
1,trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i hadn  t yet seen . renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse . my son is so jaded with current  b  science fiction that he hasn  t bothered seeing this yet .  br    br   it must be noted i didn  t see anything about cypher when it was released in australia . it must have been very quiet or i just missed it .  br    br   well this was a really pleasant surprise  this is also no b movie . it  s not a  blockbuster  of the epic variety and doesn  t try to be  more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it  s plot to be fully savoured .  br    br   the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used  my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view  but they get it right at it  s  nd appearance   that aside everything else is top notch . in any case the affects are secondary .  br    br   i won  t give anything away about the plot . the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct  though with very different content  .  br    br   just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke . the actor was born in cambridge england  and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect  it  s a tad off key . see the final twist of the plot and you  ll see why that is such a brilliant choice  and lucy liu is also just right with her  will she kiss me  will she shoot me  edge .  br    br   i rarely watch movies several times within days  this is one of them .  
0,this was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that  s where it ends . it seemed like a lackluster set it off meets the west . the plot barely made any sense . there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities . there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn  t pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along . there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations . the script should have made more sense as well as the directing . i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie . but the casting was great in my opinion . if you  re only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you .  
0,honestly  if anyone has a brain  there  s not  positive thing  br    br   to say about this movie what so ever .  br    br   i lost my   renting this . i  d rather laugh at will smith saying  if you got a dream  you got to protect it  .  br    br   all the actors must  ve been bored or had no fame at the time . even matthew mc conahay however you spell it was better then all the actors in this movie  when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw  . if you see this movie  and have anything good to say  you iq  must be extremely low  with such bad taste in movies  it hurts . thank you . . . and the truth  has been spoken   br    br   save yourself from the misery .  br    br   get devil  s rejects  now that  s a classic .  
1,this is an amazing film to watch or show young people . aside from a very brief nude scene  it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in africa that you  ll rarely find in other films . it does bear a superficial similarity to out of africa  but without all the romantic fluff . the white french people in cameroon are fascinating because they don  t even seem to regard the natives as people . the whites are all the bosses and they expect black servitude without question . however  unlike real servants  you only once hear any of the whites say  thank you  and no other regard is given these people . again and again  it  s like they are pets or slaves  as the feelings of the people are never even considered .  br    br   the central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother  aime and her servant  prote . although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other  the white woman never considers prote or the existence of his feelings . a good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has prote lace up her dress and it  s obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this . apart from this relationship  while almost all the whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the africans are people  a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage .  br    br   also interesting is the relationship between prote and the little girl  who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film  . while they are very close  at times he  s more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children .  br    br   there is one bizarre white character who seems  at times  to regard the blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing . one moment  he  s doing hard work along side the blacks or eating with them  something the other whites would never have done  and the next he  s trying to beat up prote  i could only guess as to what motivated him   perhaps he was just a jerk  or was crazy or perhaps was a communist agitator trying to stir up the blacks against the whites  who knows   . in fact  other than a few good scenes  this character seems pretty much wasted .  br    br   while i really enjoyed the insight this movie gave  i wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life . the context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more . the film appeared to begin in the early     s  since she  s wearing a walkman  style headset  and when the film went back in time  it seems that it was set about      more or less   but there was never any mention of the     s anti  colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early     s . i am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and should have made the beginning of the film earlier  such as the     s  and had the lady think back to her life there in the early     s   before the country experienced political change .  br    br   apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods  using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea . and i also appreciated the ending  as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride . but overall  it just feels like something is missing   there just isn  t any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel .

0,most of the episodes on season  are awful . . there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits  as they programs actually had decent story lines . most of amazing stories are well dull . . not amazing in the least . . go rent or buy the twilight zone series . . . i have heard season  of this series is much better . . also for some reason on the dvd  s they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation . the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in     . . . most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering . . .  
1,just the kind of movie i love . some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone . catherine tramell  stone  masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people  s lives  playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book . she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows . tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the  never visit after dark  side of town . from the beginning  there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone . stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter  an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan .  
1,imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends  year  s of his life  and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself  the murder technique is clear  but a government unwilling to admit the truth let  s a monster destroy dozens of lives . when i think my job is stressful  i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick . the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea . the comic  and almost tragic at times  relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last  years . the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat . while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as  silence of the lamb  s   the plot was just as suspenseful . rent or buy this movie today   
1,i get tired of my  and  year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch nickelodeon  disney and the like . it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons rehashed over and over again . when my daughters couldn  t go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick  i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while . i flipped the tv on and in searching for something different  i flipped the channels . my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard harvey  s voice . i adore every single solitary thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice  over work for a little duck . . . well  i couldn  t change the channel  my daughters were instantly mesmerized by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together  the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed . it  s not necessarily a proponent for  gay rights  but rather for anyone who has ever been ostracized as a child for anything . i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another . . . . too fat  too skinny  too feminine  being a bully  not being smart enough  only having one parent . . . . you name it  kids  as a rule  can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience . my girls already accept others as they are and don  t pick on others for being different . my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they  re picked on  one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often   it warms my heart when kassie stands up for her   .  br    br   so  those of you who are condemning this show because you feel that it  s an advocate for  gay rights  or are being forced to  accept certain views   you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon .  br    br   and if you need it explained to you . . . . well  you need more help than any television show could ever offer .  
1,this is the best sci  fi that i have seen in my   years of watching sci  fi . i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite . the action is great but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today .  
0,worse than the rating it has been given . this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting  a script that is poorly written  and shoddy direction . from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end  this movie is terrible . in the beginning scenes this movie has moses  which was charlton heston in the demille film   pharoah  yul brynner  and nefretiri  anne baxtor  overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand . the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to  supposedly  be . the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance . the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert . i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality .  
1,martin sheen  michelle phillips  stuart margolin and the late vic morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother  s death . mr . sheen  mr . margolin and mr . morrow all turn in first rate performances in their respective roles ms . phillips has the slightly less than enviable task of trying to spice up a made  for  tv movie  twenty  five years ago   by supplying the  sex interest  in an otherwise sexless film . the real star  however  is the  california kid   a     ford coupe  borrowed from  jake  jacobs  put before a camera and given a workout that  ll leave the viewer panting  gasping and holding the edge of the seat with breathless anticipation .  br    br   the action scenes are spectacular   although some of the dialog is a bit lame  making for a fine evening  s diversion . this is how all  car movies  should be made .  br    br   try to catch this one on the late movie channel it  s well worth the missed sleep .  
0,now  i won  t deny that when i purchased this off ebay  i had high expectations . this was an incredible out  of  print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy . however  i was soon to be disappointed . apologies to those who enjoyed it  but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch . i got a few smiles  sure  but the majority of the funny came from the music videos  which i  ve got on dvd  and the rest was basically filler . you could tell that this was not al  s greatest video achievement  that honor goes to uhf  . honestly  i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd  so if you  re an ultra  hardcore al fan and just have to own everything  buy the tape off ebay . just don  t pay too much for it .  
0,the sitcom  the league of gentlemen  follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village  royston vasey  . the different scenes are linked together by their common setting .  br    br   in the first series  a sketch show  the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through royston vasey . consequently  more foreigners visit the small town . but edward and tubbs  the owners of a  local  shop  which is actually far away from the town  do not like foreigners . whenever a visitor enters their shop  they kill him . in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all  for example  when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . edward drums  while tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims .  br    br   moreover pauline lives in royston vasey . she works at the local job centre . although pauline hates the people she has to work with  the woman does not want to loose her job . so when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman  she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet .  br    br   then there is barbara dixton  a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about  her  sexual conversion .  br    br   furthermore the vet  mr . chinnery  always kills animals instead of curing them . in one case  he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room  where a dog lays in his basket . the farmer goes outside . on the assumption that the dog is the sick animal  mr . chinnery euthanizes him . a second later  the farmer opens the door  holding the  real  sick animal  a sheep  in his hand .  br    br   some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew  his friend is killed by the shop owners  by the way  . the couple is very tidy . they have  for example  towels in different colours . each colour stands for one part of the body . besides  they have thousands of keys  marked with different colours and precisely classified .  br    br   in my opinion  the actors play very well . by playing women  the scenes become comical . the costumes are suited to the actors  too . tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters  for example edward  have unappetizing black teeth . the show has a great deal of dark humour  typical british . the set design reflects the mood of the series . the village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . even the village sign is ominous  welcome to royston vasey . you will never leave .   br    br   although i think that the actors do a great job  this type of series is not my taste .  
0,  this may be a bit on the spoilerish side  i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie  nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed . that of course is the problem with taking  what many believe to be an amazing book  and turning it into a disney made  for  tv movie .  br    br   a wrinkle in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . it  s got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . plus it  s got built in quality sequels . but disney  fying was not the way to go . the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . it is a complicated and emotional story for kids . there was no reason to make charles wallace purely  psychic   because that was the easiest way of explaining it . there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs . w  s as added tension  there is enough tension in the story without that . there was no reason to remove meg  s glasses . . . that deprived us of what could  ve been a very sweet scene between calvin and meg that happens in the book .  br    br   i could nitpick for days about little things  but i also think larger things  like the art direction was a off . take for instance the way they made camazotz look  with its strangely darkened skies . the creepiness that comes across in the book is that camazotz could be earth . it looks like earth . it has people on it that look like humans . the skies are blue  the grass is green  and there are children playing . but something is a little bit off . the directors chose to make camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . the lesson of course is that camazotz could very well be earth  that is if we forget how to love . it would  ve been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they  re walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm .  br    br   i unfortunately did not watch the end . maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well .  br    br   overall an artistic disappointment .  br    br    
1,a   year old girl develops her first serious crush on the   year old boy that lives near by  while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister . that is the simple premise of this beautiful  poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan . mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of    in     and to kill a mockingbird in      two giants of the coming of age genre . here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon  in her film debut  as the   year old girl emily warfield  as the older sister jason london  as court  the   year old boy . reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut  displaying every emotion that a   year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt  never striking a false note . warfield and london are both equally good as well . the film accurately depicts each adolescent  s thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity  never crossing over into maudlin excess even once . kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist . the music is wonderfully simple  accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene  but never becoming intrusive . the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis  who was in his    s when this was shot . tess harper and sam waterston play the girls  parents with dead aim accuracy for      caring  strict  and emotionally simple . gail strickland is good also as the boy  s mother . there are feelings to sort out  lessons to learn  and truths to face in this sweet  natured film that packs an emotional wallop . to date  this is robert mulligan  s last film . this is one of the very best films of     .  of  stars .  
1,what a delightful film . . .  br    br   accompanied by oscar  winning composer rachel portman  s lush  emotional and dreamy music  this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year .  br    br   incredible casting . . .  br    br   gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma . toni collette was great as harriett smith .  br    br   the character who stole the film was miss bates    she was mesmerizing to watch  one finds oneself on the edge of ones  seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her . one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages . from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr . woodhouse for sending  that lovely quarter  hind of pork . . . pork  mother     she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother  mrs . bates  played by emma thompson  s mother  phyllida law  who looks forlorn and lost .  br    br   the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut  wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart . we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one  s heart ripped out to her on her behalf . it is a classic scene  one to be rewound and played over  over . . .  br    br   the ending is right up there with  sense  sensibility  and provides one of life  s greatest lessons about how one should marry one  s best friend . . .  br    br   i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself .  br    br   i adored it   
1,every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize   my life isn  t as bad as i thought it was and   how important it is to adopt a child in need . there are so many out there . to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be . corrupt  but that corruption doesn  t have to reach your home . we all have a choice  definitely recommend this one . . . and while you  re at it  i  d like to throw in  the color purple  and  woman  thou art loosed  by t . d . jakes .  br    br   these are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life .  
0,i have loved this book since my  th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . and i have read it to every one of my  rd and  th grade classes over my past   years of teaching . supposedly a movie had been made in the past  but i  d never been able to locate it . well  my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l  engle  s excellent book to the screen .  br    br   as i watched the movie  i had the highest of hopes . as the film went on  i became more and more despondent . they had botched it badly  never had i been so let down by a favorite book  to  film adaption . i understand that films can  t stick strictly to a book  but they don  t need to change things for the sake of it  most  if not all  of departures from the book were totally unnecessary   br    br   i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . well  it wasn  t just me . nearly every single one felt the same way   cheated out of the great story that madeline l  engle had so skillfully created   br    br   why  they wondered  did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie  why couldn  t calvin  s hair have been red  why did mrs . which not have the proper  witch  like  outfit that was such a clever play on her name  basically  we all wondered   why did nearly every single detail have to be changed   br    br   i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . i am still waiting for that movie . this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses . i  m going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task   
0,yes i know  talkies  had just been invented for the cinema  years earlier when this was produced in     but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films . it comes over as a filmed  hammy  stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines  rolling their eyes  using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema  which i suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen . the gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film . it is now only of interest for titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film . in next chronological order they could see  titanic        a night to remember        titanic        to see how the cinema  s depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years . there have been many documentaries and tv films made including the atrocious  sos titanic        on my version which is a dvd  david mccallum gives the introduction . it was he who played harold bride marconi  s junior wireless operator in  a night to remember   still the best feature film  please read my  tribute to walter  comments on imdb under howard morley . demon . co . uk  and gave the commentary on the series of  videos entitled  end of a dream  so he was well qualified to give the narration . of more interest i found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the     us senate hearing which is also on the dvd . actors speak the actual words spoken by lightoller  nd officer  j bruce ismay  managing director of white star  harold bride and others including gloria stewart  the  old rose  in titanic      whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors .  
1,i wasn  t quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but  as it turns out  this is a pretty good show  no small thanks to talented casting  . four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings  on of their love  lives . the hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite . sharon small  s  trudi  is the homemaker one  allegedly widowed after september   th  who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends  who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors  . it  s great to see small back on t . v .  as she was great in the  inspector lynley mysteries  . the chick can act . orla brady  s character  siobhan  a lawyer  is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women  as she wrestles with her kind but self  absorbed husband hari  jaffrey  formerly of  spooks   in his driven desire to have a child with her  regardless of her needs . the final two members of the cast are the effervescent jess  shellie conn   an events planner who  s a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone  gender not specific  and katie   sarah parrish  a somber doctor who  s affair with a patient and his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control . that being said  i  m hooked now and hope that the bbc continues cranking this series out because it  s good  it  s different and it  s got a great cast .  
0,movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining . so can whoopi goldberg movies . but whoopi and dinosaurs   br    br   after the first   minutes of  theodore rex   i had come to one conclusion this movie is evil . evil  vile  wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience . nothing this bad is made by accident this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber .  br    br   first of all  whoopi does not make good action movies  watch  fatal beauty  if you think i  m lying   but the film makers don  t care  she  s a tough cop here  yet again .  br    br   seen a million cop buddy flicks this week  well  here  s number one million and one  pal .  br    br   don  t like cute  humanistic animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them  too bad  here  s another one and he  s a cop  too   br    br   you one of those people that hates car chases  shoot  outs  sloppy dialogue  boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people  goldberg  mueller  stahl  roundtree  stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write  off  a big tax write  off   br    br   and you read this review all the way to the end . you deserve a sequel . seriously .  br    br   no stars  not a one . and if they really make a sequel to  theodore rex   hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise  cracking foam rubber dinosaurs .  br    br   now  i  d pay to see that .  
0,my wife and i just finished watching bsu aka the booth . she fell asleep during some parts of the movie . i really wish i had taken a snooze with her  but the unfortunate fact is that the main character  s voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep . when our protagonist speaks  it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke . he also has no redeeming qualities . i was hoping he  d get hit by a bus five minutes into the film .  br    br   don  t get me wrong  i love asian horror cinema  but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all . if you want some good asian cinema  check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror . avoid the booth like the plague  especially if you suffer from frequent migraines .  
1,what can i say about it  it  s another hollywood  s horror flick with very high budget    million dollars  . not scary at all  it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace . a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more . catherine zeta  jones is beautiful as always  lili taylor is also a good actress . the architecture of the hill house is amazing  all these monuments  statues  furniture . . . delicious  however i don  t like the ending because it was so luscious . check this one out and form your own opinion on it . i give this picture  out of   .  
0,i was very disappointed in this     film based on a bernard malamud story . this is basically a story of possible redemption  racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust .  br    br   a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . if morris mishkin  zero mostel  will only believe in the angel  belafonte   his wife fanny  ida kaminska  will recover . the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel .  br    br   when he believes it  fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly . it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris .  br    br   jan kadar  who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in      s  the shop on main street  directs this film as well . kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn  t convey the desperate situation that she faces . she keeps calling for ruthie  their daughter  who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion . for most of the film  she does not realize the angel  s appearance in her apartment .  br    br   the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel  s girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment  is memorable but all too brief .  br    br   we don  t know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died .  br    br   those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .  
0,i  ve almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie . my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed . however  things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black  no songs   this movie  page   plenty of songs  . while black was weak to an extreme  page  delivers a gripping story with some strong acting  good direction . the songs were almost incidental  blended in almost seamlessly with the film . there certainly weren  t any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night .  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director . there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable .  br    br   i  d recommend this films for hindi  speaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life . the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which  at times  completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement . the latter because you  ll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you  ve lived it yourself .  br    br   i  d definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition . the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash . the movie does fall short in a few places though  where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film .  br    br   i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well . it was a touch amusing to watch  rather than arouse any feelings of sadness  the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish . these are minor issues though  because the film  on the whole  is truly a rare treat to watch .  br    br   overall  it  s a cynical  pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that  actors  not  heroes   that  s the key . a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting  everyday life . a behind  the  scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema .  br    br       .  
1,jason bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands  trying to make sense of what he  s just done . meanwhile  a cia chief in nyc outlines the agency  s response to what  s just happened on screen . an american flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot  but as he speaks  it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory  as if it doesn  t want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security .  br    br   this shot effectively captures the mood of the film . as well as portraying bourne  s quest to find out how he became jason bourne  ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security .  br    br   it is also probably the best film you  ll see in the cinema this year .  br    br   it  s just so intense . bourne says to simon ross  considine   this isn  t some newspaper story  this is real  and in the audience you almost believe him . the camera shakes  but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you  re there with bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers  and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they  re portraying  instead of just being actors performing well  written roles . the action scenes are so brutally fast  paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement the stunt  work is nothing short of amazing .  br    br   the pacing is just incredible . it keeps driving forward towards its conclusion  but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set  piece . while they  re often simple  the waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone  they  re charged with such dramatic intensity that you can  t take your eyes off them . the film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can  t help being swept along by it .  br    br   with its intense action set  pieces  brilliantly paced storyline  and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security  the bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . ultimatum is its peak .  
1,cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw  and to me it is timeless . it is a lovely looking film  with gorgeous animation . my favourite animation scene was the dress scene  i just love those mice . the songs are also lovely  not as good as snow white  s  but they are a delight to sing  and are reminiscent of tchaikovsky . a dream is a wish and so this is love  are standouts . the characters are also a delight . cinderella is idealistic and strong  and the mice provided great comic relief . the stepsisters were also well done  as well as lucifer . but i loved the stepmother the best  she was really evil  in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother . it is true  the movie drags slightly  with the antics of the mice  but they were genuinely funny  so i don  t care . i don  t think it is overrated  underrated don  t you mean  it rarely plays on television  but the really bad sequel does on cinemagic on a regular basis . if you want a great cinderella adaptation  try the wonderful ever after  or the lavish slipper and the rose  which isn  t as good . but whatever you do  avoid the sequel  which i have the mistake of owning  because you  ll thank me .     . bethany cox  
0,this movie deserves credit for its original approach . it combines elements of theater  film  and epic storytelling . unfortunately  it falls flat on all levels . the films biggest weakness is it  s unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp  moralistic  and epic elements without ever committing to any of them . as for the story itself  chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable  unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl .  br    br   most likely two types of people will see this  francophiles or arthuriophiles . speaking as one of the latter  i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby  disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .  
0,i am a major fan of the horror genre  i love horror  slasher  gore flicks of all kinds . some of my favorites are the really  good  bad horror flicks . but this movies has nothing to warrant it  s viewing   i  m not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that  s wrong with it .  br    br   the script is horrid . the acting is horrid . the fx are not even worth discussing . the  set  is an absolute joke   the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors  but this vehicle left them nothing to work with     br    br   suffice it to say i saw it for  free   feel i was robbed   the time you  d waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat .  
1,never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors . in the period that this film was made  people in america were different  there was no tv or all the modern things we have today  except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood . sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today . ann shirley   murder my sweet      played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks  who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley . it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened  the entire town found out about it within minutes . it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living . today  it seems very corn ball and stupid  but believe me  this was the way people were in america during the      .     s and they were a great generation that loved good family films .  
1,just came back from the first showing of basic instinct  . i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised  if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy   just as much if not more . great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking . the music is superb  reprising the original  s theme . don  t go expecting academy award material  go to see it for enjoyment and fun . that  s what movies are designed for   escapism . i can  t think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was . am thinking about going to see it again this weekend . go see it   
0,this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched . robert carlyle is a wonderful actor  but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong . to cast liev schrieber as hitler  s longtime friend and aid  haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre . a j  w playing a nazi supporter  bad bad bad casting . this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background . this was hollywood rubbish at its finest  cashing in on the strength of a strong  but sorely under utilized  supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past  years .  br    br   the fake german accents  vee vill vin zis var  is insulting to german people everywhere . my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from american  english  german all in the same sentence . the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen . jenna malone as the fated geli raubal  was splendid though  she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitler  s shadow .  br    br   if you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitler  s early years leading up to and including the war  holocaust  rent  inside the third reich      starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler . it was good and made more sense then this baloney .  br    br   as a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you  this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies .  
1,i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes . but if you liked princess bride and forest gump  you would like this movie . you can  t compare the quality of the filming to those of course  but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose . killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite . just my opinion . i  m sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french . so this film isn  t for a world audience . and while i am not a trained film critic  i know what i like . i couldn  t stop laughing through the whole movie . my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .

1,i first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it  s initial release back in      and it really had a profound effect on me  so much that i bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings . the bottom linenone of my friends walked away disappointed  ever   . this stellar film is about scottish conceptual artist  andy goldsworthy  who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials  wood  water  flowers  rocks  etc .  to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form  a statement in the temporary state of everything   . we get to see goldsworthy create several works of temporary art  as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world  as well as a few pieces in the natural world  as well . german film maker  thomas riedelsheimer directs  photographs  edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye  ear  with an ambient musical score  composed  performed by fred frith  who  s music is generally edgy experimental  noise textured guitar  as well as a capable ensemble of musicians  . although this film has been available on dvd for some years now  if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film  by all means  seek it out  it  s easily a film that was composed for the large screen  with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way  . no mpaa rating  but contains nothing to offend  unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb   
1,i have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life . believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all  time classic . i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock  stock . . . . and snatch  but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed . i absolutely loved this film and i can  t wait to see it again . this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films  and also a lot better . i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie . i believe he has taken movie  making to another level  i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film  but i believe time will prove me right  . this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the  hr or so running time as i couldn  t stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together . i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film  some answers from endless hours of thinking  some answers from reading other people  s take on the film  and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again . i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been .  
1,looking at some of the negative posts  you really have to wonder what some people do for fun . . . .  br    br   i was lucky enough to see the film during its all  too  brief theatrical run . the audience laughed its heads off . i  m watching a tape of it as i type and it  s still dang funny   br    br   it  s also got a sweet side  with unexpected turns of genuine pathos . the late  great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely  down  on  his  luck farmer wrenchmuller . ariana richards and j . j . anderson are great as the lead kids . and the actors in the martian suits  although limited to mime  do a great job  br    br   another thing to look for is the background details . the film is full of homages  pastiches  and references to other sf and fantasy films . take a look at the martian costumes next time . one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume  another is a ghostbuster  a third is in a house atreides uniform  and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit .  
0,amen to magsel . there was a lot of confusion going on . first off  how do you know which movie you are purchasing  henry cele stars in every one of them . i bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries . . . what a letdown   it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped . david hasselhoff  spelling   is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film  where was his english accent   and what  s with the love story    the movie was supposed to be about a young man  s rise to military power  not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her daddy . . .  br    br   if i had paid more than   for this movie  i would have to call the police  because that would be a crime   
1,i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid . i cried every time i watched it . it wasn  t weird to me . i totally identified with the characters . i would love to see it again  and hope i wont be disappointed   . pufnstuf rocks     i was really drawn in to the fantasy world . and to me the movie was loooong . i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them  the acting i thought was strong . i loved jack wilde . he was so dreamy to an   year old  when i first saw the movie  not in     . i can still remember the characters vividly . the flute was totally believable and i can still  feel  the evil woods . witchy poo was scary  i wouldn  t want to cross her path .  
1,most horror movies are in fact horrible movies . they get to be same ol   same ol  . same ol  pack every minute with some cheap thrill  usually  splatter   and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects . one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience . for instance  i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second . it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended  it grew roots .  br    br   subtlety can be more terrifying . less is more .  br    br   i first saw  the woman in black  on the ae channel . after flipping through the usual    channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it . this movie almost has the feel of a  masterpiece theater  production . that was fine with me  i  ve always preferred british tv  movies anyway .  br    br   most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced . but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility . the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy . the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable . hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes  fangs  claws etc . hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity .  br    br   the woman only makes about five appearances in the film . most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright . if she appeared too often  it could  ve cheapened the mood that gets set . however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we  re led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible . the scene where she  visits  arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror .  br    br   this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made . i have a copy of  the haunting    the changling  and a zillion more . i haven  t seen anything that tops  the woman in black  yet although i  m still looking . this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic  like me  a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non  existence of ghosts . i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i  d see her staring through my window  etc . maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate . this is how a really great horror film should be . like a lafanu novel  the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it  she  s squeezing the life out of you and then it  s too late .  br    br   closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen . . . and it  s a terrible shame that this is out of print . i just paid over    for my second copy of this movie . it  s a major prize in my collection . now i  m on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama .  
1,indian directors have it tough  they have to compete with movies like  laggan  where   henpecked  castrated males defend their village and half of them are certifiable idiots .  devdas   a hapless  fedar  festooned foreign return drinking to oblivion  with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one  s feelings or sentiments  alas they live in an ornate squalor of red tapestry and pageantry . but to make a good movie  you have to tight  rope walk to appease the frontbenchers who are the quentessential gapers who are mesmerized with split skirts and dishum  dishum fights preferably involving a nitwit  bollywood  leading actor who is marginally handsome . so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of leonine village head who in own words  defending his village  this is considered a violent movie or too masculine for a male audience . there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like nana patekar  narasimhan  . nana patekar lets you in his courtyard and watch him beret and mock the politician when his loyal admirers burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him  meanwhile his daughter is bathing his grandson . this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india . nana patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films . the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with songdances thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies won  t sell  a sad but true state of affairs . faster this changes better for  bollywood  . all said and done this is one good movie .  
1,  saving grace  is never riotously funny  but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree . brenda blethyn is a fine actress  and does a good job at portraying widower grace  who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts . the supporting cast also does a fine job . french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role . the premise alone is appealing . the idea of an over  the  hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough . and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then . of course  there are flat moments  like one where two elderly women mistaken grace  s marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work . that was a mindless gag that didn  t quite take off . the film  s tone is downbeat and occasionally dull  but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation .  br    br   my score   out of     
0,closer to reality and containing more depth than  breakdance   stan lathan  s  beat street  is still a pretty dull show . again this pic is really only cashing in on the  breakin  craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot  which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother  all growing up in queens  new york . each has their own unique talent . one is a hustler  one a d . j .  another an artist who creates  burners   while little bro  lee is a hot  hip hop  dancer .  br    br   lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though  and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters . therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the  fresh  dancing to save the day .  br    br   choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes  but this alone is not enough to lift   beat street  to greater heights . unfortunately the film really falls flat late on  after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting .  br    br   sunday  august         video  
0,now that che       has finished its relatively short australian cinema run  extremely limited release  screen in sydney  after  wks   i can guiltlessly join both hosts of  at the movies  in taking steven soderbergh to task .  br    br   it  s usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style  subject  but soderbergh  s most recent stinker  the girlfriend experience        was also missing a story  so narrative  and editing   seem to suddenly be soderbergh  s main challenge . strange  after    odd years in the business . he was probably never much good at narrative  just hid it well inside  edgy  projects .  br    br   none of this excuses him this present  almost diabolical failure . as david stratton warns   two parts of che don  t  even  make a whole  .  br    br   epic biopic in name only  che       barely qualifies as a feature film  it certainly has no legs  inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history  soderbergh  s  .  hrs  long dirge just goes nowhere .  br    br   even margaret pomeranz  the more forgiving of australia  s at the movies duo  noted about soderbergh  s repetitious waste of  hd digital storage    you  re in the woods . . . you  re in the woods . . . you  re in the woods . . .  . i too am surprised soderbergh didn  t give us another  .  hrs of that somewhere between his existing two parts  because he still left out massive chunks of che  s  revolutionary  life   br    br   for a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure  soderbergh unaccountably alienates  if not deliberately insults  his audiences by  br    br    . never providing most of che  s story  br    br    . imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition  br    br    . ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events  br    br    . barely developing an idea  or a character  br    br    . remaining claustrophobically episodic  br    br    . ignoring proper context for scenes    whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts  br    br    . linguistically dislocating all audiences  even spanish  speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in english   and  br    br    . pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension . why  at this late stage  the t  shirt franchise has been a success   br    br   our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to peter buchman and benjamin vander veen basing their screenplay solely on guevara  s memoirs . so  like a poor student who has read only one of his allotted texts for his assignment  soderbergh  s product is exceedingly limited in perspective .  br    br   the audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge  scenery and circumstances of the  revolutionaries   but that doesn  t elicit our sympathy . instead  it dawns on us that  ah  soderbergh  s trying to hobble his audiences the same as the latino peasants were at the time  . but these are the same illiterate latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . why does soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them  and keep us equally mentally captive  such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose .  br    br   part  is more chronological than part   but it  s literally mind  numbing with its repetitive bush  bashing  misery of outlook  and lack of variety or character arcs . deltoro  s che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill  disciplined troops . the only letup is the humour as che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant  revolutionaries   some of whom violently lack self  control around local peasants or food . we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions  nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency  such as it was .  br    br   part   s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic again  nothing is telegraphed or contextualized . thus even the scenes with fidel castro  demin bichir  are unexpected and disconcerting . any selected events are portrayed minimally and latino  centrically  with part   s interviews replaced by time  shifting meetings between the corrupt bolivian president  joaquim de almeida  and us government officials promising cia intervention    .  br    br   the rest of part   s  woods  and day  for  night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they  re eyeing the exits .  br    br   perhaps deltoro felt too keenly the frustration of many non  american latinos about never getting a truthful  unspun history of che  s exploits within their own countries . when foreign governments still won  t deliver a free press to their people   for whatever reason   then one can see how a popular american indie producer might set out to entice the not  so  well  read   i may not be able to read or write  but i  m not illiterate     cf . the inspector general        out to their own local cinemas . the film  s obvious neglects and gross over  simplifications hint very strongly that it  s aiming only at the comprehensions of the less  informed who still speak little english . if they did  they  d have read tomes on the subject already  and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves   learning the lessons of history as they should .  br    br   such insights are precisely what societies still need   and not just the remaining illiterate latinos of central and south america   yet it  s what che       gleefully fails to deliver . soderbergh buries his lead because he  s weak on narrative . i am gobsmacked why benicio deltoro deliberately chose soderbergh for this project if he knew this . it  s been   yrs  hindsight about guevara was sorely wanted it  s what i went to see this film for  but the director diabolically robs us of that .  br    br   david stratton  writing in the australian     oct       observed that while part  was  uneven   part  actually  goes rapidly downhill  from there   charting che  s final campaign in bolivia in excruciating detail   which  . . . feels almost unbearably slow and turgid  .  br    br   chethe guerilla aka part  is certainly no travelogue for bolivia  painting it a picture of misery and atavism . the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour  and the dramatic   yet tragic   capture and execution of the film  s subject .  br    br   the rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing  irritating misery   shockingly  for a soderbergh film  to be avoided at all costs . it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject .        
1,i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it . the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit  its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there . the sound effects and audio are amazing . there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not . you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic . the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you . if you want to get the full experience  try playing it with head phones on .  
0,i grew up watching the original disney cinderella  and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn .  br    br   accordingly  i was excited to see that cinderella  was coming on tv and i would be able to see it .  br    br   i should have known better .  br    br   this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone . it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm  it seems  to me  quite rough  and almost brutal  right from the  don  t  sing  a  longs to the characterization .  br    br   while i remember the character  s telling a story through a song  this film  s soundtrack was laid over the top  and didn  t seem to fit . jaq  s transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there  he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall  and in the ballroom  there  s old barn dance type country music . it  s as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set . the upbeat fiddles certainly didn  t fit .  br    br   even the artwork and animation in cinderella  isn  t up to scratch with the original . the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed . and we see part of cinderella  s hoop skirt  which doesn  t feel right .  br    br   the movie itself could have been it  s own story  i think that it should have been just that . i wouldn  t say that i hate it  but i believe that it had many shortcomings . it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original .  
1,american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa . on the train he met a french girl celine . although they met the first time  they talked like good friends . when the train stopped at vienna  jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna . then the romantic story unfolded .  br    br   at first they were cautious . the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store . they peeked at each other  though their eyes did not contact . after in  depth conversation  they relationship became close . then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend . their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words .  br    br   love is a strange thing . when you really want it  it will not come as you wished . love needs mutual understanding . without it  love will not last long . spiritual harmony is the most important for love .  br    br   excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie .  br    br   one of the best romance movies .      
1,from the mind of robert bloch  of  psycho  fame  come four tales of twisty terror in this amicus anthology film  which  while not quite as much fun  or scary  as i would have liked  still provides for some decent genre entertainment .  br    br   it  s linked by the wrap  around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective  john bennett  who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor he  s advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place  and our film is off and running .  br    br    method for murder  has author charles hillyer  always delightful denholm elliott  haunted by his latest fictional creation  who has seemingly come to life . this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments  and is capped by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement .  br    br    waxworks  stars horror icon peter cushing as retired stockbroker philip grayson  who  along with old friend neville rogers  joss ackland  becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum . most effective in this episode is the dream sequence  although it  s great as always to watch cushing . the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking .  br    br    sweets to the sweet  features another well  loved horror star  christopher lee  as john reid  who doesn  t treat adorable moppet child jane  chloe franks  with too much kindness  and it  s up to new companion  tutor ann norton  nyree dawn porter  to find out why . the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently the film  makers wisely don  t tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family . the  dying  moments are particularly horrific .  br    br    the cloak  has the most outright comedy of the four jon pertwee  one of many actors to have played the role of dr . who over the years  is a lot of fun as a vain  temperamental horror movie star  in fact  he  s the highlight of this story  who  infuriated with the lack of quality in his latest low  budget film  goes out and buys his own cloak . said cloak has strange powers  which i dare not reveal here . sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as pertwees  companion one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing jab taken at none other than christopher lee   br    br   the wrap  up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector holloway learns that he should have taken all of the warnings given him more seriously .  br    br   underscored by michael dress  s unusual  striking  and eerie score   the house that dripped blood  is an entertaining mix of stories while i don  t enjoy it quite as much as  say   tales from the crypt   it  s still good fun . capably directed by peter duffell  it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions  and is certainly a good film of its type .  br    br        
1,the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in     . it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church . i was quite young at the time but i  m not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father  .  br    br   there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think  ne of them is the fact that there  s not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie  so every creak  thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there  s no distraction . another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there  s no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on . this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door   br    br   a superb ghost story  i  ve never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after  to my knowledge  only one showing   
1,i  ve seen a great many films  but  in cold blood  stands alone in a class by itself . it excels in every department . the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story  rather than the name on the marquee . blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo . the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place  even inside the very house  add additional chills . the black  white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent . there are many outstanding cinematic works out there  but if i could only vote for one to top the list  it would most probably be  in cold blood  .  
0,the opening shot was the best thing about this movie  because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate  well  crafted independent film . damn that opening shot for filling me hope . as the  film  progressed in a slow  plodding manner  my thoughts were varied in relation to this  film   was there too much butter in my popcorn  did the actors have to pay the director to be in this  film   did i get my ticket validated at the box office  yes  dear reader . i saw this film in the theatre  this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre  because at home you can turn it off . were there any redeeming values  peter lemongelli as the standard college  nerd  had his moments  especially in a dog collar . other than that this  film  went from trying to be a comedy  to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter . it succeeded on none of these fronts . oh  and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad . her performance was the only comedy i found .  
1,sadly   simple rules  for dating my teenage daughter  was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in     . he was one of my all time favourite actors . he had it all  comedy  who can forget him in three  s company  but he was also an excellent dramatic actor  unforgivable  worth watching tv movie  as much i loved all the other cast members of the show  katey  amy  kaley and martin  john was the star  he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place  and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time .  br    br   i loved how the show wasn  t all sugary sweet  as much as i loved the cosby show  come on  they were too nice to each other lol  they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly . it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents  but they still kept it funny . a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not  and this show didn  t do that . yes  there were some  like tackling important issues  such as drugs and bullying  but they didn  t try and be anything other than a fun family comedy .  br    br   the way they wrote john  s death in to the show was brilliantly done  i still sob like a baby each time i see it . you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes .  br    br   i  m sad the show was cancelled  i still enjoy watching the reruns  and i never get tired of it .  br    br   john ritter  you  ll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father  who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy   you rock ritter     
1,a community pool in connecticut is the setting for this  under the radar  film which is charming  funny  entertaining  and appealing . although it won prizes in major film festivals   the big bad swim  was not released to hordes of theaters across america  but was distributed in dvd form  and shown in theaters selectively .  br    br   it is unfortunate that  the big bad swim  never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release  considering how many sinkers hollywood has released this year  such as  i know who killed me .   the big bad swim   a genuinely good independent film  has had to swim upstream on its own .  br    br   nevertheless  in  the big bad swim   actress paget brewster is endearing and believable as amy  the wired  to  breaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job  and ends up taking a gamble on a new life . tv soap actor jeff branson   who is hot   plays noah  the earnest  vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears  and discovers he can learn from his students . pretty  sexy jess weixler  did i just see her in a bank commercial   deftly plays jordan  the swimmer  to  be who works two jobs  one as a pole dancer  the other as a blackjack dealer . her character provides the catalyst for change amongst the ensemble  but is the least understandable of the characters  because of a lack of a  back story  or motivation as to why she does what she does . jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous  video  camera  toting younger brother who spies on her . however  her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way  which seems odd . there  s no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal  attractive girl from a connecticut suburb would choose to be a self  medicating pole dancer who debases herself for loutish bachelor parties .  br    br   despite this quibble   the big bad swim  succeeds  in large part  because it is a happy  feel good film .  br    br   as one might expect  learning to swim is the metaphor for life . ultimately it  s better to jump in with both feet  and get in the swim  rather than sit on the deck  because life happens to you anyway .  br    br   the big bad swim is a great date movie  a great dorm movie  a great  what haven  t i seen  movie  and men like it as well as women .  
0,this movie sucks ass . something about a heatwave in some european country  complete trash . there  s nothing going for this movie whatsoever . maybe   seconds of sex but that  s it . there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off . this movie is complete rash and you shouldn  t subject yourself to watching it . i regret it it  s very boring . i would rate it zero but i can  t . no body in their right mind should see this . i  m sure you  ll regret it completely i did . how could they think up something this bad . even mystery men was better . mystery men . that sucks . that movie wasn  t worth being made . complete waste of time . the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored .  
0,i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that . the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions  deliberate and otherwise  effect the lives of the others . the film  s premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise . too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it . as a result  i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally . by the end of the movie  i had a  so what  attitude about all of them . a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great  but as it stands it is merely so  so

1,anyone who does not find this movie funny  does not understand simple comedy . this movie is not a complex comedy  it is full of one liners  and sight gags  and will make anyone who wants to laugh  laugh . . . the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up   
1,i loved dedee pfeiffer  is that spelled right   in cybil . haven  t seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her . i thought she did a great job in this . the supporting cast was pretty good too . in some angles  the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman . the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists . the young boyfriend was a hottie . i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure .  br    br   just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies . kept my interest and i  ll watch it again when they rerun it . can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this  you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want . thanks in advance . aboutagirly .  
1,my dog recently passed away  and this was a movie i loved as a kid  so i had to see it to try to cheer up .  br    br    beware of dog  i mean spoilers .  this movie isn  t just for kids and it  s far from ordinary . it was set in new orleans in     . first and foremost  the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film  but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with .  br    br   in the beginning  charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner  carface . he is money driven  greedy  and just escaped death row  as he states in the start of the feature . the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others anne marie and his sidekick  itchy . carface will not even listen to the fat  ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him .  br    br   carface attempts to murder the hero  because he wants     of the profits in their business and won  t settle for only     a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die . also  being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not . this is a cartoon  and that  s why it is logical here .  br    br   carface  s method of revenge is through murder  while charlie believes success is the best revenge  financial success that is . after surviving death  he starts a business by taking carface  s source of financing  a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals . they win a whole bunch of races  and charlie tells her he  ll give the money to the poor  hint hint charlie and itchy live in a junkyard  and are therefore poor . he uses the money toward his casino  bar  theatre  and not the other  poor .  the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion  and she listens carefully . she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling  lying  and stealing . charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses . she added the ethics that his business needed  while charlie did management  and itchy provided construction .  br    br   carface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlie  s business  which is unprotected by the government . charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl . in the end he had to choose between her life and his own . he first grabs the watch out of self preservation  and sets it down when the girl started to sink . both the girl and the watch were sinking  and he had to choose which one  and he chose the girl .  br    br   the great part about this movie that focuses on a person  s ability to learn right from wrong over time  and a child  s ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet  is that it never shows anyone dying  the watch symbolizes his life  and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped . all the deaths were suggestive  even for the villain . i didn  t cry during this movie until now  and i have gotten so much more out of it  that i had to write it down and share it with you .  
0,ironic that dr . seuss  fable emphasizing the non  commercialization of christmas should be one of the most hyped  marketed  and successful blockbusters of the holiday season . the general gist of ron howard  s adaptation is that the grinch  s bane against christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for cindy lou who  played very well by taylor momsen  . this movie makes an ardent  ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of seuss  story  but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of chuck jones  animated version . jim carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish grinch  but whether it  s the dialogue  the pacing  or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot  the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly . there are some wonderful visuals and the make  up work is amazing  yet beyond the technical triumphs there  s an element or two here that  s missing .  br    br   succinctness   br    br   soul   br    br   or maybe jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his    minute cartoon that howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long . howard  carey  and crew are all very capable and talented  but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product . if you must see the feature  length version  rent it on video with jones  animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better . i give this film three cans of who  hash out of five .

0,i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together  the talk is not of the master  s great films like  north by northwest  or  strangers on a train   but a lesser  known effort like this one from      obscure and seriously flawed  which showcases the great director in fledgling form .  br    br   emily and fred hill  joan barry and harry kendall  are a middle  class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun .  br    br   just ask richard hannay  roger o . thornhill  or marion crane . well  marion  s indisposed at the moment  but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight  setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock  s earliest foray into this theme  and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense  but the two do not cohere  at least not here .  br    br   the hills are a dull  flat couple  with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies bergre  in the form of cross  cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers .  the curtain  s gone up too soon   gasps emily .  they aren  t dressed .   br    br   when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing  even if the people they partner off with are drips  too . emily  s man  gordon  percy marmont  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs  which he suggests be filled by emily . fred  s girl  the princess   betty amann  has clara bow  s eyes and wallace beery  s five o  clock shadow . there  s also an obnoxious fellow passenger  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come .  br    br   everything is shot in an abrupt manner  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn  t come off  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged  together rickshaws  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism .  br    br   emily  s the only vaguely sympathetic character  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon  but mostly because she  s among the first of hitchcock  s many magnetic blondes  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film  s conclusion .  br    br   matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set  piece for the protagonists to come to grips with  and presumably repair their relationship . only they aren  t active participants in the resolution  and except for the fate of a friendly cat  nothing about the ending resonates .  br    br   at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early     s  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food .  rich and strange  is hitchcock paying his dues  and learning his trade  one for scholars but not casual film goers .  
1,saying a film is depressing isn  t necessarily a bad thing . i  m very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one . it  s the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty . but  i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the     s   because peasant life in china was tough to say the least . be prepared to watch segments about famine  death and disease .  br    br   about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni . while he was an exceptionally talented man  it  s just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era . if you are paying attention at all  it  s pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part .  
0,the directors cut version  which was the one i saw  was very long for this type of movie . almost two hours is way too long . if you have the choice  definitely go for the non  directors cut .  br    br   the main plot is almost not taken up at all  the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes  which are connected but the feeling is that they  re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence . the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there .  br    br   as a horror movie it doesn  t work . you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition  character is presented    minutes later character is dead  . this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .  
1,personally  i find the movie to be quite a good watch . it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized .  br    br   not only that  it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don  t just go all out and wipe out triads .  br    br   overall  the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings  torture . nevertheless  the movie stays true to the real world  thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens .  br    br   i  d recommend this movie to any triad  mafia movie fan . another good watch would be dragon squad . that movie has more guns than this  as in this movie there  s more knives than guns  in fact i don  t remember seeing a single gun  .  
1,this movie is one for the ages . first  i have to say after seeing this once  it became one of my all  time favorite movies . why  simple ben coccio  writer  director  has put together a true piece of art . where   .   of movies these days are purely entertainment  director ben coccio gives us truth  gives us reality  gives us a learning tool to know why this happened . the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face  able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before  into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . while it surely is graphic and horrifying  how couldn  t it be  the gloves come off  the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened . sometimes it isn  t just a screw loose like everyone likes to think  no  sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper  are more human  we are shown that these boys are us and we them . society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real .  br    br   respect and love your fellow man . a lesson we all should learn  thank you so much for making this film mr . coccio  i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film  making career .  
0,seeing this movie  as i just did for the first time on turner classic  which lists it as  dangerous female    can only multiply your appreciation for the     bogart  astor version . ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk . i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will they made him the actor he was . the women are all good  but no better than that . well  una merkel is a little better . more interesting are the  original  joel cairo and mr . gutman  who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set  changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles  peter lorre and sydney greenstreet . humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake here  sam spade and ruth wonderley    can  t .  br    br   this movie doesn  t exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham . its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the     falcon  don  t just happen . on the   to    scale i rate it a   mainly for the camera work and the supporting players .  
0,it  s getting worse  the series is on a serious down fall . the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really  really terrible movies . robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can  t act . the story is alice  having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series  finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again . this time  the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of alice  s unborn child . his intention is to be  born again  into the real world . the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother  but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son  check out the first three  miss the next three then watch the last one .  
1,this was the second of two filmed  hamlets  in the nineties  the first being franco zeffirelli  s  starring mel gibson  from     . zeffirelli  s version  like laurence olivier  s from      was based upon an abridged version of the play  with much of shakespeare  s original text being cut .  i have never seen tony richardson  s     version  but as that ran to less than two hours  shorter even than zeffirelli  s  i presume that was also abridged  . kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious  a film based on the complete text of the play  with a running time of around four hours .  br    br   with his  henry v   branagh claimed olivier  s crown as the cinema  s leading shakespearean  confirming his claim with his brilliant  much ado about nothing   a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy .  hamlet  was his third shakespeare film as director  he also acted as iago in oliver parker  s      othello   and  as one might expect  it is very different to  much ado .  . the earlier film  shot in a villa in the hills of tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside  is a joyous  summertime film about everything that makes life worth living .  br    br    hamlet   by contrast is set in the depths of winter .  the flowers in the description of ophelia  s death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer  . the look of the film is particularly striking  both sumptuous and chilly . it was filmed at blenheim palace  possibly england  s most grandiose stately home  but also a rather forbidding one . the snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry the interior ones formal and elaborate . the action is updated to the mid nineteenth century the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era  while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms .  there is a contrast here with zeffirelli  s film  where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone  . the play is dominated by images of corruption and decay branagh  s intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying  something rotten in the state of denmark  .  br    br   the film is notable for the large number of big  name actors  some of them in very minor roles .  blink  and you might miss john gieldgud or judi dench  . apparently  an all  star cast was required by the production company  who were nervous about a four  hour film . some of the imported hollywood stars  such as robin williams  osric  did not really come off  but others  like charlton heston  s player king or billy crystal  s first gravedigger  played their parts very well . yorick  normally only seen as a skull  is here seen in flashback  played by the british comedian ken dodd . brian blessed  who often plays jovial characters  is cast against type as the ghost  and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening .  br    br   of the major characters  perhaps the weakest was kate winslet  s ophelia . branagh  s leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson  but their marriage ended in divorce in     . i did  however  find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role although winslet came into her own in the ophelia  s mad scenes  she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane .  i preferred helena bonham carter in zeffirelli  s version  . richard briers plays polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given  a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool . julie christie also brings dignity to the role of gertrude there is no attempt here  as there was with gibson and glenn close in the zeffirelli version  to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and hamlet .  an interpretation which owes more to freud than it does to shakespeare  . the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son  which was certainly not the case with close and gibson .  olivier  s gertrude  eileen herlie  was  bizarrely  thirteen years younger than him  .  br    br   branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to  reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy .  much stress is placed upon the war with norway and the norwegian prince fortinbras  a subplot ignored altogether by zeffirelli . this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of claudius  sometimes played as a one  dimensional villain . there is something about derek jacobi  s performance which suggests that claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances  but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust . he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother  but chose to rule as a bad king . although he is tormented by guilt  he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done .  br    br   branagh  a wonderfully fluent speaker of shakespeare  s verse  is superb in the main role . like gibson  he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as indecisive  passive and melancholy . his is an active  physical  energetic hamlet  something best shown in his fatal duel with laertes . his guiding principle is not world  weary despair  but an active disgust with evil and corruption .  br    br   it was a gamble for branagh to make a four  hour epic  and the film did not do well at the box office . it was  however  praised by many critics  james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic . my own opinion is that  whatever the financial returns may have been  branagh  s gamble paid off in artistic terms . by concentrating on the full text  he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeare  s most complex play . when i reviewed his  much ado   i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy . his  hamlet  may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy .       
0,superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made . the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl  and all the attempts made to stop them . how tom selleck and donna mills  careers managed to survive this is beyond me . however  the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all  avoid this one if possible .  
0,my friends and i walked out after   minutes  and we weren  t the first . afterwards  we tried to get our money back . movie theater management wouldn  t allow this  but they did agree to let us see another film . the only time that worked for us was to see dickie roberts former child star . as you can tell  this wasn  t a memorable night . probably one of my worst movie nights . close second has to be when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist . in conclusion  for the sake of humanity  please don  t see the order .  
1,cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams . it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations  both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget .  br    br   there are many great laughs  even if the story is somewhat thin  sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late     s hollywood comedy style . a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses  which must have sounded quite excessive to a     audience . as he makes his exit  he assures the client  grant  that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of     .   from the total . . . or at least    .   . . . but certainly    .   . hilarious   
0,if you  re the kind of movie  goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense . . . then look elsewhere  kids  cause sleepwalkers really sucks . usually i  m more eloquent than that  but . . . wow . . . this was bad . i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home  she declines  and then he is seen walking home . where  s his car   anyway  just don  t see it  folks . i really want to be more specific  but words escape me . cats jumping on people . a guy getting stabbed by corn . cheesey lines up the proverbial  wazoo  . just don  t see it . wait  i take that back  see it for writer stephen king  s cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard . he  s actually pretty good . even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman  king gives the best performance of the film . but  other than that . . . wow . . . bad .

1,an unqualified    .  the level of writing and acting in this australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of  old  hollywood . sam neill and meryl streep are very good together . neill matches streep line for line  and take for take   it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best  notwithstanding the intensity of his role . this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama  portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms . the movie   which won several top awards in australia   boasts not only a superlative cast and director  but wonderful and authentic australian locales . it proves that people are the same the world over . and  after all these years  people still delight in repeating the famous streep line  accent and all  a dingo ate moy baby   including that imp  elaine benis  on  seinfeld .   
1,wonderful family drama  comedy starring macclaine and garr that entertains and warms the heart every time i see it . strongly recommended for all ages from  year olds to grannies . lovely period piece capturing     . the story encompasses the struggling garr  her two children and aunt zena  macclaine  trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household . the  family  heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left garr a run down  ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late      s . the tenacious garr  as the sweet but determined mom  gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe . but wait . . . . . . aunt zena is an old circus performer with card tricks  magic powders and a jesters sense of humor . . . . . . she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games . . . . . what happens next is a delightful combination of  miracle at lords  thrown together with the cuban missile crises  with authentic tv news from the real event  and a  ghost  prank that gets totally out of hand . this film entertains  philosophizes  questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of october      s cuban missile crises . in the end one is left with the wonder of faith  family and rediscovered love . oh  and the music from the era of the early    s is just great   br    br   recommend strongly as a feel good film   out    
1,while i would say i enjoy the show  i expected something completely different from when i first saw  what i like about you  i expected to find something along the lines of  all that   i am not sure if it is going on anymore  but i have to say i do like the show and while i don  t classify it as a breakthrough show  it is very charming and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well  including the supporting cast   br    br   i would definitely say that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen because i really loved him in city guy . i had also seen the woman who plays valerie  s friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show  i do not really like her character in this show because she  s just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well  
0,i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed . the word  vagina  says it all . a body part . nothing shocking here . i could say to my doctor   my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis  or  my vagina hurts after cycling  with equal or more social commentary . it could be the  tricep monologues  for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard . the monologues were dull but delivered with drama  the topics were outdated  and i was alternately bored and annoyed . once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn  t when i was supposed to . surely this isn  t really a hit . oh  and spoilers there was a lesbian   oh  wait  maybe not  come to think of it . and inappropriate fondling  and a crack mama  that about covers it .  
0,may  anne reid  and toots  peter vaughan  are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son bobby  steven mackintosh  and his family in london . even as the visit begins  toots suffers a fatal heart attack  leaving may adrift  unsure  and questioning her life and future . finding herself attracted to her daughter  s boyfriend darren  daniel craig   her actions lead to inevitable consequences .  br    br   beautifully filmed  but for all its heralded realism and acclaim  the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant  even repellent characters  and asks the viewer to engage with them . reid shines as may  and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire  but michell and kureishi have allowed craig  mackintosh and cathryn bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters  that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to may . as written  the characters played by mackintosh and bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold  hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was kureishi trying to say . as directed  they are either unwilling or unable to lift bobby and paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness .  br    br   worth seeing for reid  s performance  but little else . a crying shame . . .

1,i bought dark angel seasons    two weeks ago  after catching a couple of season  episodes on channel  . nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is . i haven  t enjoyed anything as much since firefly  also and amazing show  . i  ll admit season  wqasn  t quite as good  but there are still some amazing episodes  see designate this  bag  em  the berrisford agenda  harbor lights  freak nation etc .  and alec is great . i  ve heard some of the plans for the would  be season   and i have to say  i can  t believe it was cancelled  i won  t spoil it for you  but it would have rocked  i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie  although at the moment it seems highly unlikely  . as proof of my obsessiveness  max  s barcode number is              and in the two weeks i  ve had it  i am  episodes away from having watched both seasons twice . it  s just too good .  
0,trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you  ve heard about semi  devout mormons  and you  ll see they  ve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film . finally kurt hale  s fortunes have changed  thank goodness  and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters .  br    br   the cinematography was amateurish  i think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes  . the plot was limp and very unfunny . you really didn  t understand why anyone did anything . it was like i had sand in my eyes  and a     pound lady was sitting on my face  it was that painful .  br    br   the only reason i didn  t give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won  t let me .  
1,i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney . this movie has been in my memory for over   years and i have been looking for it . i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then   this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once  i really hoped i would get to see it again . the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory . to this day  i never did see it after that day back in the   s  in fact  i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me . i loved it and want my kids to see it . does anybody know where i can find it   
0,rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . actors of stature  robert duvall  robert downey  jr .  are deployed in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee  stained camera lens a writer  john grisham  who has never produced anything of merit  discovers new depths of under  motivated incoherence . the film has a cheap  lecherous feel about it  but barely at the level of commentary  its really part of the aesthetic . normally  i come on to the imdb to write balanced  generally appreciative comments . this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless  bilious rant . i won  t  but only because i no longer want to occupy my  mind  with this trash .  
0,arthur askey  s great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public . his juvenile jokes  silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world . a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him  and he was never completely comfortable in films . he has his moments in the ghost train  and his character  tommy gander  has been tailored to make the most of his talents  but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated .  br    br   askey  s support in the film is not strong  it includes regular co  star richard murdoch betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple linden travers going over the top as a  mad woman  . also on board are peter murray  hill  who off  screen married phyllis calvert  as the nominal leading man  giving a totally bland reading of the part  and leading lady carol lynne  who turns in an equally insipid performance . it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham  s brandy .  
0,i am a lover of b movies  give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven . these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world . even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing . then there was hammerhead  which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others . first there was the science of creating the shark  man  which the movie barely touched on . in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes . during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead  what fabulous special effects  . back to the science  i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue . anyway this movie had poor plot development  terrible story  and i  m sorry to say pretty bad acting . not even william forsythe  hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker .  
0,i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran  so i didn  t know who had done it at first . the longer i saw it  the more i started thinking   jesus  this looks like an albert pyun flick .  wasn  t quite sure  though  for two main reasons the photography was quite good  and the utah desert scenery was beautiful   and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon  a murderous cyborg  but with some style and a sense of humor . paulin must have ad  libbed the many clever one  liners he shot out  because albert pyun hasn  t written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career . unfortunately  paulin doesn  t have all that much screen time before he  s gone  and the movie  s the worse for it . lance henriksen  playing the evil head cyborg  growls his way through his part  as he  s done in countless other movies like this . i don  t know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it . he goes through the movie looking  and sounding  like he just woke up  and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent . kathy long  the nominal hero  has a great body  is attractive  has a great body  fights extremely well  has a great body  and doesn  t have an iota of acting talent  but that doesn  t matter in a movie like this . this being an albert pyun film  it  s full of the trademarks that we  ve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog  choppy editing  and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured   ah  nobody  ll ever notice .   br    br   as bad as this movie is  however  it  s a shade above most of pyun  s other efforts   this is  citizen kane  compared to his brain  numbing  adrenaline feel the rush   for example . the fights are pretty well done  if repetitive  after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other  you find yourself saying   alright already  go to something else    and long is very athletic  and  as a previous poster has noted  has a great derrire  . it  s not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination  but it  s not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun  s usual extravaganzas . you could do worse than rent this movie   not much worse  granted  but worse nonetheless .  
0,this is one of the worst films ever . i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . where are the images in the film that are on the box  i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film .  br    br   why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading  i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . i have no one to blame except myself . i want my money and time back .  br    br   do not watch this movie .  br    br   even if curiosity is motivating you  stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . it will be much more enjoyable . you have been warned   
1,for a mature man  to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response  to a mature film .  br    br   if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that   life  can never be the same  after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level .  br    br    
1,yes  that  s right  it is . i firmly believe that the n   and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made . it was amazing the first time i saw it  with its huge environments and colorful characters  and its amazing now . the play control is perfect  the graphics are beautiful  and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there . a must have for any n   owner  and a reason to get an n   for everyone else .  
0,a very young ginger rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter lyle talbot in this     murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions . the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house  or was it from a lover  s apartment  rogers actually has two identities at the film  s outset  that of miss terry  the dead victim  s secretary  along with her newspaper byline of pat morgan . mistakenly phoning her story directly to ted rand  talbot  instead of her paper  s rewrite desk  she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he  s been out scooped .  br    br   here  s a puzzle  it  s revealed during police inspector russell  s  purnell pratt  investigation of harker  s death that terry  morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks . why exactly was that  after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story  but before  clues are dropped regarding harker  s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building  but again  that association isn  t relevant until it  s all linked up to janitor peterson  harvey clark  . and who  s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a hsss  with the words  you will hear it  cut and pasted beneath  apparently  the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house  s radiator system  which peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims  such as mrs . coby in the apartment below harker . but in answer to a question posed to inspector russell about mrs . coby  s death  he replied  apparently  to the cause of strangulation .  br    br   it  s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me . the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the building  s incinerator furnace  however  and score another point against continuity  we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway  but how  and still pretty as a picture . and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant wilfred  arthur hoyt   who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room .  br    br   sorry  but for all those reviewers who found  a shriek in the night  to be a satisfying whodunit  i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a veritable  the usual suspects  by comparison . if you need a reason to see the film  it would be ginger rogers  but be advised  she doesn  t dance .  
0,i know nothing of the iliad so can not comment on it  s accuracy to that story . however  as a stand alone film i found this very boring . the battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious cgi .  br    br   the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies . but he does not make a good warrior  too pretty i am afraid .  br    br   good points are is the design . this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings  walls impressive . i do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely . we hear american  scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation .  br    br   all in all  i do not recommend this film for a family sit down . it is too long and the young will get bored .  br    br   for adults  it is ok if you don  t care about the lack realism .  
1,i didn  t feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless .  br    br   it is original  although reminded me a little of two other french films  vidocq and city of lost children  mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters .  br    br   set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off  this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster .  br    br   always interesting  with the perennial  black arts  well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable   br    br   scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing .  
1,back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didn  t just listen to william randolph hearst  she  d have done more films like show people and been a lot happier . in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy  she  d have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith .  br    br   what you  re seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies  a gifted comedienne  a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person . she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire  she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardom .  br    br   if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story . i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story . marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others  looking for that big break . she wants to drama  but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics . she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face  but learns her trade . and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines .  br    br   she does get her first big break  but it doesn  t come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli  playing andre telfair  a pretend no account count of avignon . somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen  lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it  one of the most despised people in cinema .  br    br   show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves . you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin  douglas fairbanks  william s . hart  mae murray  john gilbert  eleanor boardman etc .  just being themselves in and around the film colony . that in itself makes show people a film worth saving .  br    br   show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like  ain  t we got fun  i  m sitting on top of the world  you  d be surprised  california  here i come . as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced  a song called crossroads was introduced in it . it  s not a bad number  but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack . i guess since they  re not seen  it was felt no billing was necessary . still i  d like to know and i  m sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people .  br    br   it  s easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite . she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience .  
0,this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time . it stars shaquille o  neil and is about a rapping genie . apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece . the movie gets  out of   .  
0,although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl . film festival  there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this . one   it  s an ultra  low budget canadian film . two   it  s written  directed and starring the same person  usually a bad sign  unless it  s woody allen  george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers  . but despite my watching it with lowered expectations  it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible .  br    br   in a nutshell   bad script  bad acting  terrible directing  don  t waste your time or money on this turkey . it claims to be a comedy  but i only laughed twice . plus  there is awful music blaring throughout . how this got any attention i  ll never know .  
1,i saw this movie back in      we first started watching  this is spinal tap  and after  minutes we were ready to fall asleep . so we went instead to see this movie . if you have any conspiracy theory  s going around in your head  you will want to watch this one .  br    br   the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this   in my opinion there is no doubt that they could   br    br   but i don  t want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself .  br    br   but  just to let you know  we still talk about this movie   years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do .  
1,i watched this over the christmas period  i don  t know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it  so there we are .  br    br   arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances  great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it .  br    br   dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily  spoiled  rich  lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself  but turns him into someone you love . liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough  soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for . john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish .  br    br   i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good  check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film .  
0,it was a painful experience  the whole story is actually there so i won  t go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work  i thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn  t even tell him anything about it . . . not to mentioned bad acting very bad can  t get any worst than that my advice don  t watch and i thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi boll  s movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this   
1,a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother   saving grace  seems cut from the same cloth as a half  dozen other british comedies over the past two years . . . underdog is faced with adversity  finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him  herself in the process .  br    br   widowed and thus broke  grace is a master gardener  and is enlisted to help her friend  employee matthew grow his pot plant . he  s been doing it all wrong  so grace helps him out . they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot  which they can both benefit from . he enjoys smoking  she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage .  br    br   highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise  dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in  saturday night fever  and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb .  br    br   blethyn is always watchable  and you can  t say that about a lot of people . . well  i can  t  anyway . ferguson is very good  and tcheky karyo  who i liked in  la femme nikita   is memorable .  br    br   not profoundly moving or insightful  but immensely entertaining  and at a brisk   minutes  feels like a walk with friends .     .  
1,an american woman  her european husband and children return to her mother  s home in  watch on the rhine   a     film based on the play by lillian hellman  and starring paul lukas  whom i believe is repeating his stage role here   bette davis  lucile watson  george coulouris  geraldine fitzgerald  and donald woods . an anti  fascist  a worker in the underground movement  many times injured  and wanted by the nazis  kurt muller  lukas  is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother  in  law . but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests  coulouris  is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out .  br    br   great performances abound in this film  written very much to put forth lillian hellman  s liberal point of view . it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released  as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes . the movie  s big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in  casablanca .  humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick  but lukas is transcendent as kurt . the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut  wrenching  just to mention one scene .  br    br   though this isn  t what one thinks of as a bette davis movie  she gives a masterful performance here as kurt  s loyal and loving wife  sara . her acting tugs at the heart  and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender .  br    br   the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions . lillian hellman is not everyone  s cup of tea  but unlike  the little foxes   she has written some truly sympathetic  wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers . highly recommended .  
1,nyc model alison parker  cristina raines  rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations . as lawyer boyfriend michael lerman  chris sarandon  goes about making inquiries on her behalf  she struggles to maintain her sanity  not to mention her will to live  as her experiences take a toll on her physical  mental  and emotional health .  br    br   i don  t want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it . the story is interesting and entertaining  but the film doesn  t really offer much in terms of real scares . or  for that matter  any atmosphere . it is sort of quietly sinister  but it  s not like the traditional horror film . it  s more of a story about a troubled woman  s attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life . on that level  it works  but it  s not quite powerful enough .  br    br   what  the sentinel  does offer are some eye  catching set pieces  in particular  the fascinating  fabulously creepy climax  and there  s a scene with beverly d  angelo that must be seen to be believed  . there  s also some gore to be seen  but not very much . an ominous music score by gil melle adds to the menace .  br    br   no review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film  makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast . some of them don  t get to do too much  but to see all of them together is impressive . eli wallach and burgess meredith make the biggest impressions as  respectively  a hard  nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor . other legendary names include jose ferrer  arthur kennedy  and ava gardner . future stars like d  angelo  christopher walken  tom berenger  jeff goldblum make brief appearances  and other familiar faces include jerry orbach  sylvia miles  william hickey  and martin balsam . whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize .  br    br   written for the screen by director michael winner  probably best known for the  death wish  series that he did with charles bronson  from the novel by jeffrey konvitz .  br    br   i wouldn  t consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining .  br    br        
0,it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations .  br    br   mac  akshay kumar  and sam  s  john abraham  characters are not properly built before mac  s boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess . rest of the drama is about how mac  sam and uncle mambo  paresh rawal  deal with situations which at times seem forced .  br    br   about the cast  paresh rawal is a very talented actor  i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook . akshay kumar is tolerable  john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture  rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie .  br    br   the second half of the movie is funny at times  but in all a dud  songs are boring  and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy .  
0,this movie makes no sense at all  there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through . the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever . i will put my comments in the chat board  but save your time and money  this is stupid . i can  t stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music  and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level . but it is nice to see denzel w . prevail over the man  who comes in  flavors  jodi foster  mayor bloomberg and capt . von trapp . there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice .  
0,i recently watched belle epoque  thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film . i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film . maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now  the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times . aside from predictability of the plot  some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline  ex . a certain event at the wedding  . at times the film was a bit preachy in it  s ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church . the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments  the scenery  and the character of violeta being a strong  independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics .  
0,  visitor q  is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world  s most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter  etc . the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following . however  with home video quality and a slapdash production   visitor q  just doesn  t hold up even as a curiosity . genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible  make  up is awful  and everything else is amateurish at best . a waste of time .  c    
0,i will be short . . . this film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer . the very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are  treated  to a lingering dance scene . the plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of bad horror will get anything out of it . and for the love of god please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not  childish fumbling lesbians  what the hell   . this was by far the worst film at the edinburgh festival  that i saw anyway   someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldn  t take any more of it . this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy . in short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class a drugs .  
1,i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne  s  waitress        . this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie . adrienne was a marvelously talented writer  director  an original and unique artist . she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency . ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge . male lead reg rodgers  looking like judd nelson  is fine . there is also a great cameo by ben vereen . the song at the end of the movie  the bastard song  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy  br    br    it  s a world of suffering   br    br   in a sea of pain   br    br   no matter how much sun you bring   br    br   you  re pummeled by the rain . . .  br    br   don  t let the heartless get you down   br    br   don  t greet the heartless at your door   br    br   don  t live among the heartless   
1,sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner  surely he isn  t the avatar of subtlety  as his films are practically always hard  handed and confronting  but so what  they  re awesomely entertaining . his most famous action movies  like the first three entries in the  death wish   series for example  are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns  but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres  like the religious horrors of  the sentinel  for example  he doesn  t stand a chance with any of the critics .  the sentinel  generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release  when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth . pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd  s browning  s masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema  freaks  to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years  and why  just because certain prudish and easily offended people  who shouldn  t watch the movie in the first place  claim it  s an unethical thing to do  i don  t suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films  so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place  another major reason why critics didn  t warmly welcome  the sentinel  is because jeffrey konvitz  novel  and thus michael winner  s screenplay  is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus  according to the merciless pens of horror critics  little more than pure plagiarism . admittedly  the sentinel  borrows multiple substantial elements from  rosemary  s baby    the omen  and  the exorcist   but let  s face it     s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories . if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and  in all fairness  a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots   the sentinel  honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying    s horror  highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you  re not likely to forget easy .  br    br   alison parker  a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas  moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn  deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already . alison  s physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after  and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery . she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats  even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants . she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide . it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building  but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this . it  s truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison  s brownstone apartment is the earth  s gateway to hell itself and she  s the chosen one to guard it  because the film  s script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation . for nearly   minutes  and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences  michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison  s own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fiance  s odd behavior are strictly red herrings . multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius  like alison  s flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs . the whole climax  with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above  is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail  biting denouements i ever witnessed .  br    br   the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive  especially considering  the sentinel  still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn  t the most popular among prominent actors  but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective . with such an extended cast  obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos . martin balsam and john carradine  for example  only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together . several others  like christopher walken  jeff goldblum  beverly d  angelo and tom berenger  perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays  but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers . my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector . the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up  even though he sports a ridiculous mustache . in my humble opinion  the sentinel  is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie  and most definitely a must  see for true genre fanatics .  
0,a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies  one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit  run . the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper  how festive . only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears  the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch . so it  s up to dad to say the day .  br    br   this late    s made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia . when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail  biter  but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it  s merely lame  boring  and not really well  acted in the least bit .  br    br   my grade d  
0,i saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema . i had some hopes for the movie because i really like spoorloos  the vanishing  and the book it  s based on . the movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller . quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines  characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for  like marjoke  and terrible editing . the movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long  a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don  t add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped . after suffering through the story you  ll get treated to one of the worst endings i  ve seen in a very long . it should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you  re probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies . it  s hard to mention any good things about this movie . about a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and i didn  t hear a kind word after the movie was over . avoid this movie at all costs . it really destroyed any faith i had left in the dutch movie industry .  
1,i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his  her reluctant guardian . i  ve seen enough of them  baby boom  kolya  about a boy  mostly martha  and to some extent  whale rider  to expect to be bored by the formula . what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small  town china in the      s . extreme poverty was the norm  and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market . when wang discovers his purchased grandson  whom he  s nicknamed  doggie   is a granddaughter  he initially casts her out  even though she  s showed great promise as street  performing heir . even after he reluctantly takes her back  he  s not too upset when she  s kidnapped . the film is gritty then  showing the lengths to which a young  street  smart girl had to go to survive in that society .  br    br   the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context . in a western society  one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success . wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status  though  that i did  too . while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern  suburban child  it  s completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage . and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her  her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense .  br    br   the peek at small  town life in a foreign country  the naturalness of the two lead actors  the surprising plot twists  and of course  the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film .  
1,william castle is notorious among horror fans as the b  grade director of the     s and   s . his gimmicks  his cost  cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary . it comes as no surprise  then  that someone  jeffrey schwarz  who  s made countless documentaries  would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness . such is  spine tingler the william castle story  .  br    br   i had a general understanding of who castle was  having seen some of his films over the years . i knew nothing about her personal life  his goals and ambitions . this film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film  making and his contributions to the horror genre . the movie depicts castle as rival to alfred hitchcock  with hitch being the artist who wins praise while castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety  but much less respect . he is an icon to all second  rate directors out there  which is why it  s not surprising that john waters is featured prominently in here .  joe dante and stuart gordon also have sizable roles .   br    br   his gimmicks were what drove his fame  and the documentary takes great pains to explain them  which is crucial for those who are too young to remember . the rudimentary   d of    ghosts   see separate review   the buzzer in the seat for  the tingler   see separate review   money back guarantees for  homicidal  . . . watching these films now outside the theater  we can judge them for their content  which  personally  i still enjoy  but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt .  br    br   the climax of the film is when castle goes from cult director to hollywood producer . having bought the rights to  rosemary  s baby   he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release . hoping to direct  he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director roman polanski . while at first disappointed  this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime   a hugely successful film  and a job he excels at . who better to control the purse of wild artist polanski than a penny  pinching castle  this was to be his crowning achievement  though sadly the film is more often connected to polanski than castle .  br    br   the remainder of his years are played out  and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece . across the board  everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man . somewhere along the way  he surely upset one or two people  but you would never know it from this film . and i find that find   this is a celebration of bill castle  s life  not  e  true hollywood story  . fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work .  br    br   i would personally recommend picking up the william castle collection  which has not only this but eight of castle  s films in it  with plenty of special features . even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how schwarz was personally affected by castle  and have castle  s daughter terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes . it  s almost a whole new film .  
1,a light  hearted comedy  nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing . anything you don  t like  be it a stack of bills  a bad memory  or even hunger can disappear at your wish . they approached this movie very well  and with an enjoyable starring duo  there were only a few things i didn  t like about nothing  and they weren  t even part of the main movie .  br    br   first  the post  credits scene  and yes  there is one   good for a chuckle  but what were they trying to accomplish with that  i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing . instead  we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream . it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion  and wasn  t really necessary  nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame .  br    br   second  the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd  and like others have already said this  it promotes a horror movie that never came . oh well  poor marketing i guess .  br    br   if you see this at your movie rental store  take a look  because nothing is a great movie to watch . if you have a big screen though  you might want to wear shades .  
1,oh  those sneaky italians . it  s not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the  in this case  author of the novel . of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema  mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it . james m . cain  s publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until     but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic .  br    br   the movie is not as great to watch as the     american version but it  s a great movie nevertheless . this of course not in the least is due to the movie it  s great strong story  that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism . it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story  with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment .  br    br   leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it . these early drama  s always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch . unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end  when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts . the movie could had easily ended   minutes earlier .  br    br   nevertheless  i don  t really have much else negative to say about this movie . it  s simply a greatly made one  based on some equally great and strong source material . quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti  who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies .  br    br        
1,     . the sleepy small southern town of clarksburg . evil sheriff roy childress  the almighty vic morrow in peak nasty form  cracks down super hard on speeders by forcing said offenders off a cliff to their untimely deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road . childress meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael mccord  a splendidly smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen  shows up in town in his souped  up automobile with the specific intention of avenging the death of his brother  sheen  s real  life sibling joe estevez in a brief cameo  . director richard t . heffron  working from a taut and intriguing script by richard compton  the same guy who directed the    s drive  in movie gems  welcome home  soldier boys  and  macon county line    relates the gripping story at a brisk pace  neatly creates a flavorsome    s period setting  and ably milks plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and wills between childress and mccord . the uniformly fine cast helps a lot sheen radiates a brash james deanesque rebellious vibe in the lead  morrow makes the most out of his meaty bad guy part  plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie  stuart margolin as a folksy deputy  nick nolte as amiable gas station attendant buzz stafford  gary morgan as buzz  s endearingly gawky younger brother lyle  janit baldwin as sassy local tart sissy  britt leach as stingy cab driver johnny  and frederic downs as the stern judge j . a . hooker . the climactic vehicular confrontation between childress and mccord is a real pulse  pounding white  knuckle thrilling doozy . terry k . meade  s sharp cinematography  the well  drawn characters  for example  childress became obsessed with busting speeders after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident   the groovy  syncopated score by luchi de jesus  and the beautiful mountainside scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made  for  tv winner .  
1,i don  t know what it is i find so endearing about this film  but the first time i saw it  i wanted to see how it ended . i  m not a big fan of paul winfield nor of war  dramas  but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child . all he knows is that the boy has green eyes . truth be told  i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while  but this movie is somewhat of one man  s odyssey after the pains of war . winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories . there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront . why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me .  
1,funny . sad . charming . these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful  simple film .  br    br   it is rare that a movie truly moves me  but  shall we dance   accomplished that with grace to spare . gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie  viewing history . it left me with a quiet sense of exultation  but with a small touch of sadness mixed in .  br    br   and the dancing  oh yes  the dancing . even if you are not a lover of the art  or can  t put one foot in front of another  the steps displayed here will take your breath away  and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can . it was absolutely enchanting  even the parts that show sugiyama  s  touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho  stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous  child  like way . and yet  this film was not entirely about dancing  but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings . we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance  a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art  and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast .  br    br   beauty . pain . emotion . all the love and little agonies of life are here  expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture .  br    br    
0,the plot certainly seemed interesting enough . how can a real  life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie  well  you can watch  wonderland  and find out .  br    br   i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people . unfortunately  there is zero character development  so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters . the pace of the direction was very tedious . this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie .  br    br   given that dawn schiller  a central character as holmes  s girlfriend  was an associate producer and that holmes  s wife was a consultant on the film  we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters .  
0,i gave this two stars for the awesome dv shot clarity  which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character . that was being generous  i know .  br    br   this film fails on all accounts . i can not recommend this  for it is neither poetic  nor blunt . neither dramatic  nor suspenseful . neither controversial  nor ordinary . it is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith .  br    br   do not watch this  whoever you are . . . please  just stay away from this awful product .  br    br   thank you .  
1,for a film that got little publicity  and few people have heard about  this was pretty good . it  s another one of these modern  day british crime films that are quirky   snatch    sexy beast   etc .  . it  s not wild like  snatch  but it  s interesting and it has some rough characters .  br    br   it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show  not late  has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first  time viewer . basically  it  s about a low  key british male who sends away for a russian  mail order bride  who winds up  with the aid of two russian male friends  providing a couple of big surprises .  br    br   ben chapin and nicole kidman co  star  and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman  s russian cohorts . this is a different kind of film and well  acted . kidman once again proves she  s far more than just a beautiful face .  
1,the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert . they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past  present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner . director john  bud  cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger  crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds . moreover  cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder . the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams  dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana  christopher mitchum as the concerned richard  marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth  natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny  and scott c . kolden as the gutsy steve . the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures  neat stop  motion animation monsters  said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy  a big  lumpy  fanged beast  and a scrawny lizard dude   and nifty matte paintings . richard band  s rousing full  bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot . john arthur morrill  s crisp  sunny cinematography likewise does the trick . a fun flick .  
1,visconti  s first feature  ossessione is an adaptation of james m . cain  s the postman always rings twice . now  i  m not familiar with that book or the other film versions  but i am a big fan of cain  s double indemnity  much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder  s film version of it  in fact  . the two novellas seem like they must be very similar . both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her . giovanna  the woman in this italian version  played very well by clara calamai  is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity  but she seems very spoiled . her husband  a great performance by juan de landa  is a bit cruel to her  but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him . he  s older than her and unattractive  so she  s rather fickle . when gino shows up  a young  muscular man  it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed . she sweats she wants to be with him forever  but she  s stuck with her husband . they break up at first  but when they meet again  they  apparently  although this is intentionally vague  plan to murder the husband . they are successful  and they move back to the woman  s home town to run the bar that her husband owned . gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea . he wants giovanna  but the one thing that he certainly doesn  t want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life . their relationship quickly crumbles . ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters . it  s always fascinating  but it does go on a bit too long . at two hours and twenty  two minutes  i can  t  for the life of me  figure out how it took that long  this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film . it was  after all  the first film that won that label . we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life  without any hurrying to the next plot point . i  ve seen many of visconti  s films  and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers       . his direction is as great as it ever was  with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect . i also feel the need to point out the film  s best performance  by dhia christiani as a young  exotic  dancer and part  time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna . she  s only in the film for maybe five or six minutes  and she has only a few lines . it  s shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time . she  s absolutely heartbreaking .     .  
1,leonard maltin must  ve been watching some other movie .  though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource  please disregard his comments on this one .  he states  starts off well then fizzles  when it  s really the reverse   starts off tepid then catches fire  . the plot is about as simple as it gets . happy mom  happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach  dad incapacitated in accident  mom runs off to get help  meets up with dangerous escaped convict . mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life .  br    br   good white  knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker  appearing suddenly  the director  john sturges  films it in a clever way that will make you gasp  around halfway through as the cunning  desperate criminal . meeker is an unusually flippant  reckless actor  at least here and in the classic  kiss me deadly   and he happily snatches the keys to the film  s narrative and speeds off with the top down . his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying  pretty neat  huh   when he  s especially pleased with his misdeeds . there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage  barbara stanwyck   don  t go away  . she fires back  where would i go    they  re in the middle of nowhere  and he realizes sitcom  ishly  yeah  that  s right  . the friction between them is a hoot .  br    br   there are flaws  somewhat ridiculous ones . there  s one scene where the police  who have been chasing after meeker for some time  stop stanwyck  s car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would  and pretends to be asleep as she  s being questioned . a . he looks conspicuously un  masculine in this pose and b . i think it  s safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion .  br    br   still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion .  br    br    
1,  the godfather  of television  but aside from it  s acclaim and mobster characters  the two are nothing alike . tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks . his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families   in one family he is a loving father yet not  so  perfect  husband  and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy . after analysis  dr . melfi concludes that tony  s problems actually derive from his mother livia  who  s suspected to have borderline  personality disorder . gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet bracco and marchand aren  t nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother  respectively . falco  imperioli and dematteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles . van zandt  from the e  street band  plays his first and only role as tony  s best friend  and is quite convincing and latching . chianese  the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film  plays tony  s uncle and on  and  off nemesis . many fans also enjoyed characters played by pastore  ventimiglia  curatola  proval  pantoliano  lip  sciorra and buscemi . tony  s children are  okay  but not notable  with the exception of iler  s stunning performance in the third  to  last episode   the second coming    sirico and schirripa are unconvincing and over  the  top  but the show is too strong for them to hold it back . even as the show continues for over six season  it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment .  br    br     out of four   
1,i absolutely loved this soap . it has been one of my favorite . will highly recommend   . . . i just love brazilian soaps  they deal with real life events . i  m really sad that the soap ended but i  m sure i  ll be able to find it somewhere . for those of you who have not seen it  please see it . i loved the characters  the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains . the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love . i can  t wait to see it again and highly recommend it . xica has been by far  the best soap i have ever seen . forget everything else   go xica . . hope you all like it as well .  
0,before i start  let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing  which i gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some . so  it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new dvd version would make a difference . i have also not read the corresponding book i  m only familiar with one other japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context .  br    br   potential minor spoilers ahead .  br    br   i usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories  the likes of blade runner    monkeys  etc .   but i did not enjoy this movie at all . while it started out mildly intriguing  it became tedious by the time it was only half  way finished . there are all sorts of problems let  s start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue . the characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences if they aren  t shouting each other  s names for the n  th time  they are usually grunting monosyllables   kanedaaa     tetsuoooo     huh     grrr   etc .  . this leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two  dimensional . it doesn  t help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals .  br    br   the grunting is augmented by some random pseudo  philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by star trek standards . there is nothing deep and meaningful here  it all seems haphazard  thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci  fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever .  br    br   what little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction . not that there  s anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction  of course but in this case you  ll find yourself asking  what  s the point of it all  and how long until it  s over  . character development in the last   minutes or so consists of little more than tetsuo turning into pizza the hutt for no readily apparent reason .  br    br   the ending resembles the one in      a bizarre string of images that  far from resolving or explaining anything  leave the viewer feeling he  s just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours . i  m sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes .  some of the music was also quite interesting  . unfortunately it  s all style and no substance .  br    br   tired of disney  want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with  adult  themes  i  m sad to say you  re more likely to find that sort of thing in  south park  .  
0,i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck . the concept of the film wasn  t very good to start with . this movie has so many bad things about it i don  t know where to start . the acting is horrible . the cinematography is marginal at best . the soundtrack was pretty bad . the score is terrible . there  s a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater     . i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that  people actually thought this  film  is excellent . they must have liked the two go  go dancers . final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside wichita and never let anyone see it again  a  out of   rating is far better than this deserves .  
0,office work  especially in this era of computers  multi  functional copy machines  e  mail  voice mail  snail mail and temps   is territory ripe with satirical possibilities  a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers  and office space   and very successfully . this latest addition to the temp  humor pool  however  haiku tunnel   directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth  fails to live up to it  s predecessors  and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door  waiting for a chance to sneak in . unfortunately for the audience  that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try  but as the man once said  no cigar .  br    br   as the narrator  star of the film  josh kornbluth  playing josh kornbluth   points out in the opening frames  in a monologue delivered directly into the camera   this story is pure fiction  and takes place in the fictional city of san franc  l  isco .  it  s an innovative  if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer  and not all that funny . it is  however  a harbinger of what is to follow  all of which   like the disclaimer   just isn  t all that funny .  br    br   kornbluth plays kornbluth  an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp .  it  s a job that suits him  and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time . but when he goes to work for a lawyer  bob shelby  warren keith   he does too good a job on the first day  and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d  amore  helen shumaker  to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm .  the thought of working full time for the same company  though  initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth  but he caves in and signs on for the position . he  s nervous about it  but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence  which  of course  they would never do with a temp   and if things get too rough  he has seventeen important letters he  s typed up   that now just have to be mailed out   to fall back on  he  s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part  and he needs that something easy to do  in reserve  in case it all gets to be too much for him  . these are important  letters  however  and by the end of the week  kornbluth still has them in reserve  on his desk . and it doesn  t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it  kornbluth  s days as the fair  haired boy are going to be over . and quick .  br    br   the brothers kornbluth  who not only directed  but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film  should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy  where it says if you play it straight  they will laugh .  but  they didn  t  and the audience won  t . because in comedy  even looking at it as objectively as possible  when the main character  as well as most of the supporting characters  in this case  plays  funny   as in  he knows  he  s being funny   he never is . and that  s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny   he comes across as insincere and pretentious  a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths  because by allowing it  they sabotaged their own movie .  br    br   in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn  t work  it comes down to two basic reasons the directing  which   if not necessarily bad    is at least careless and secondly  the performances  beginning with that of josh kornbluth . quite simply  kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here . unlike stiller  or even steve martin   both of whom use self  deprecating humor very effectively   kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he  the real kornbluth  is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character . and being unable to get past that does him in  as well as the film . rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify  kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach . so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting  and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with  with an inexplicably narrow focus  given the potential of the rich subject matter   it  s easy to understand why this one just doesn  t fly .  br    br   the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby  whose subtle delivery is convincing  and which   in and of itself   is fairly humorous . the effectiveness of it is diminished  however  inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth  which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project .  br    br   shumaker and sarah overman  julie faustino  also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances  which are commendable  if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable  and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth  s performance  if only momentarily . but it  s still not enough to save the day or the film .  br    br   the supporting cast includes amy resnick  mindy   brian thorstenson  clifford   june lomena  davonne   joe bellan  jimmy the mail clerk   with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer  as the orientation leader   a role that begs for an answer to the question  what was he thinking when he agreed to this   in any work environment  there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone  s comedic cannon  and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones  see paragraph one  may even become classics in their own right . haiku tunnel   however  will doubtfully remain very long amongst them  for it  s destiny lies elsewhere   in a realm known only as obscurity .  i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br    
1,looking back over the past   years  since my first exposure to the show   all i can say is once you get it  it will stay with you forever . i remember my initial reaction being   annoyingly overacted    under produced   unlikeable characters  br    br   well  two years later i watched some episodes again and didn  t find it nearly as annoying . a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it  s bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness . yes  the show has a style that is not for everybody  and i  m sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now . but  i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times . . .  br    br   btw i am a married man . . .  for all who think this is a show for females   
1,this film is a great fun . i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends . i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world  i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time . but they all thanked me and loved the movie . you know it is a great film if you spend  hours after the film talking about the movie   br    br   i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri  s level  but no where near the same size ring . he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a . a . group where everyone trusts everyone else . he would  sponsor  only people who seemed very well to do . who knew he would have stolen in excess of    k  in     when that was real money  after being in town for only  month . his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober . he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face .  br    br   the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor . but i don  t want to give anything away .  br    br   i just found this one night on a late night movie channel   showtim  i think . this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown . just drag your friends over to see this and don  t tell them a thing . it is a very entertaining film  it moves quickly and never bores you .  br    br   this should be a international classic for all time . i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top . time will be very good to this film . i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet  in some ways that makes the surprises even better .  br    br   the director and editor were fantastic . they deserved winning the best documentary .  br    br   just watch this film   
0,we actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time . maybe we  d missed something . . . nope  what  s missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction . i actually went back to robbin  s novel to see if i could find the problem  and i discovered that what i thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy  headed junk .  br    br   so  the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all  and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there . absolutely nothing works  not a blessed thing . some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots . all of the actors look at least uncomfortable  angie dickenson looks positively mortified  except for rain phoenix  who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is . the dialog is one  long  unwavering cringe . scenes don  t make sense from second to second  and the connections between them are nonexistent . and yet  the movie stumbles blindly on  convinced that it is saying something profound .  br    br   this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating . gus van zant has done other good  to  great movies which i encourage you to see  and i  m happy he survived  and appears to have learned from  this mess .  
1,  imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch  as soon as i first heard that  my attention was locked on the trailer  and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show . a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show . i think the acting and casting is just perfect  each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it  s perfection . even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense  from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens  they never seem to let me down . and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical  such as an exploding scratch  sniff book   br    br   even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days  daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest  being not just a mystery but a love story  comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie . . . . . err show .  br    br   what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc  for years i never had a reason to turn to abc  but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face . it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me . but just like that  after two seasons  a few awards  a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped . it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me . i will always be a fan of this show though  and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch .  
1,  br    br   i saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old  i bugged my parents to take me back three times . i began looking for it on video about five years ago  finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site  but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased  i understand the original video run was small   or have the rights purchased by the family channel  disney  etc . and shown regularly . it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan  narrated by a wise old tree . the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well . it would be a good seller today  better than many of the weak offerings to children  s movies today .  
1,as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings  this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea . presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men  i cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens   the months of preparation leading to zero day  the codename for the day on which they will attack  the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun . it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer  yet focuses on the literal preparation . the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered . the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending  as expected . but leading up to this point  it  s never really clear as to why they are planning this out . we are told the obligatory story that they were mocked  but the film also seems to contradict this . without ruining the film  it  s easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions  but falls short because of sloppy film  making . all directing is amateur  to further the homemade video concept  but the story and continuity is weak . the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot  but also fails to provide the information for such an event . the ending is abrupt  and doesn  t feel like it finishes everything that the film began .  
1,rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to planet earth . . . of course planet earth is better  it has much much more of the same . earth is like an extended trailer for the planet earth series  and as such  is inevitably inferior and simplified . but that is not comparing like with like .  br    br   as a feature  length documentary  or actually as a feature  length anything   it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life  unless you choose to traverse the earth in helicopters with long  range cameras for years on end  and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth  which  lets face it  is unlikely  .  br    br   on the narration yes everyone in the uk  very much including me  adores david attenborough  and there  s little excuse for him not to be narrating here  but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three . he wasn  t a presenter on planet earth  just a narrator  and i  m sure he  s modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a good thing .  br    br   anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe  majesty and glory . all reviewers agree on that . those who love it  ie . everyone  will  should go on to see an buy planet earth . so three cheers for its cinematic release  and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on dvd rather than the planet earth box  set . but as works of art they  re not in competition here people .  br    br   the earth is big enough for both .  
0,i haven  t read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movie  s lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun .  br    br   i don  t know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life . i agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if singleton didn  t make his characters such broad caricatures .  br    br   on the surface he tries to portray ice cube  s character as a bad guy  provoking remy to become a racist skinhead . but who graduates at the end in the movie  s redeeming epilogue  it seems singleton points at white as either unable to empathize  i didn  t say sympathize   with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead . many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry .  br    br   nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism  which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle . quite honestly what was the point   
1,i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid . at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was  cool  because of it  s about sports . now  several years later  i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was . this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues . that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i don  t think is to our society  s benefit . sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now  but they drew kids in . no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children  but they will ask to see a movie about baseball . disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world .  br    br   as a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive  however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job .  
0,here we are two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth . . . one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life  another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race .  br    br   so what could we call this killing machine  it  s almost like he  s some kind of destroyer  or eradicator . . . sort of like an exterminator or something . what  s the word i  m looking for . . . something that  terminates  things  hmmmm . . . .  br    br   anyway  the protector  who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from luke skywalker in favour of local clothing  finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future  born hero  to  be . the evil uhhhh . . .  exterminator  kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes  then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people  s eyes and repeating her name threateningly .  br    br   then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable  exterminator  pursues the couple across the countryside . at some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle  but i  m not sure .  br    br   perhaps  in an exciting finale  he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of . . . acid . then the truck will crash . they will be saved . . . but no  he will then re  emerge  as strong as ever . he will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant  where in a terrifying finish  he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery  and destroyed once and for all .  br    br   but maybe i  m extrapolating too much . . . after all  i did stop watching this movie after mr . protector magically impregnates sean young by kissing her at a bar  then tells her the child will be born in  days .  br    br   the costumes and effects are great in this movie . . . i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek next generation too  sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replicant  and career sweat  hog stephen baldwin is also on board as young  s fat cop boyfriend . not sure where he fits into the plot though . . . maybe he  s an import from a different james cameron movie   
0,although there were some amusing moments  i thought the movie was pretty lame . the longer it ran  the worse it got . once the action entered monument valley  i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters .  br    br   the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent . first she  s in on the deal  then discovers the truth and she bails . then she  s back again  then deserts them again . then she  s back again . there  s no apparent motivation for any of her decisions . there were interesting characters  some interesting scenes  and many missed possibilities . i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts . apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one . searchers  .  is no match for the searchers .  
1,having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers  ratings i was most pleasantly surprised . although clearly low  budget  it bears the signs of clever ingenuity . for example  when julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window i found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location . and lo and behold  the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water  s edge . there are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller . savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed .  br    br   as to the performances  george macready is his usual creepy self  barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence . nina foch was surprisingly good as the no  nonsense working girl who  s not about to submit without a fight . but dame may witty  oh boy  she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes .  br    br   this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed .  
1,never realized that charles boyer   luis denard  appeared with lauren bacall   rose cullen  in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together . even peter lorre   contreras  had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint . this story deals with a republican courier  luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations . lauren bacall   rose cullen  comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life . the real bad guy in this film is victor francen   licata   beast with five fingers  who gives an outstanding performance . great classic     film without humphrey bogart .  
1,first of all i  d just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels . mcbain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle . it has all of the classic elements of a late    s  early    s action film . . . . the random gratuitous acts of violence  ie . when walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money   the snapping of necks  the guys on fire  the guys that get blown off buildings  and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings . walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as   let  s go sit . . . . . . . . . . out on the deck .  and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store . if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst .  
0,  i don  t understand . none of this makes any sense    exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder . having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie  i know exactly how he feels . the story  by the film  s director aristide massacessi  good old joe d  amato using his real name for a change   is a clumsy mix of the supernatural  murder  mystery  and pretentious arty rubbish  the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy   s garbage such as jess franco  s more bizarre efforts  but which had me struggling to remain conscious .  br    br   opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister  with whom he had been having an incestuous affair  before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor   death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman  played by ewa aulin  who stars in the equally strange  death laid an egg   is seen alive and kicking  the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrck . after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home  where she is tended to by creepy dr . sturges  klaus kinski in a throwaway role   the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr . and mrs . ravensbrck  meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin   .  br    br    so far  so good   i thought to myself at this point   we  ve had hunchbacks  incest  some blood and guts  and gratuitous female nudity  all ingredients of a great trashy euro  horror what follows  however  is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings  ghostly goings on  and even elements from edgar allan poe  s  the black cat   to tell a very silly  utterly bewildering  and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave .  br    br   this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb  but given the choice  i would much rather watch one of the director  s sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible  meandering  surreal   s gothic horror just ain  t my thing   .  out of    purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness   rounded up to  for imdb .  
0,this is the worst movie i  ve ever seen . i  m not kidding . the next time it comes on  i will just continually run my head into a wall . it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again .  br    br   i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again . they are both good comedians  so i was shocked this was so awkward .  br    br   if they had to do it all over again  i  m pretty sure that they would decide to not do it . the folks that fronted the money  must have lost a ton . not really  because the special effects  all  of them  were terrible .  
1,daniell steel  s daddy  what a refreshing story . this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children . how rare is that  in these times of  heather has two mommies   or what ever  you fill in the blanks  it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone . with the father  s roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga . how disappointing to have it end . every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role . i would have loved to see each character develop over the years . i loved this movie  it is one i will defiantly watch every time it  s on . good story  good acting  and i hope this isn  t a spoiler  but no obtrusive sex or bad language . yes it touched my heart . warning  get the kleenex ready . what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment  be it television or . movie  s . daniell if your listening  you go girl  give us more .  
1,when i first watched this  we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about  times . we  ve just watched it again and i liked it more than i did the last time i  d watched it         br    br   the film is mainly about two dogs called charlie and itchy  voiced by dom deluise and i love dom deluise   . charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie  which i like . itchy is his sidekick . charlie is killed by his friend  not  and sent to heaven . when charlie comes back to life  it is the start of an amazing adventure .  br    br   the five main reasons why i  m absolutely crazy about this film one i love the characters  except carface  . my favourite three are charlie  itchy and a little girl called anne  marie who comes slightly later . two i love the period of history in which this film is set . it is set during the prohibition in the united states . three the don bluth animation  as usual  is superb . the backgrounds are good too . four there is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat . five the songs in this are lovely . my favourite song starts with  i need brazil  the throb  the thrill  . . .  br    br   so  watch this lovely film when you can  you won  t be disappointed          
0,creepy  lascivious wolf . the young  red  is wearing full make  up  and extremely short shorts  robe . got about   minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile  s dream come true . the  up  beat  music sounds a lot like something i  d hear at a strip club . i actually think this movie is a sick joke  it  s not a family movie . gross  glad i was watching this with my daughter  i don  t want her to think it  s normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together . very bad  very sad it  s sold as a family film  joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it . and what  s with advertising it as a  special effects spectacular     the effects do look low budget  gawd awful .  
1,mat spirogolou  s  toby malone  family know he is a talented footballer  and are pleased when he secures an audition to join a big club . they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him .  br    br   but the cousins are like chalk and cheese one a naive farm boy  the other a streetwise spendthrift who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters . mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day .  br    br   having missed his cousin george  damien robertson  on arrival in the city  mat encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one .  br    br   toby malone  probably better known for his work in theatre  puts in a commendable performance as the bucolic teenager . there are telltale signs of a low budget  but as with so many other low  budget movies there  s more fun  seemingly more spontaneity  and more charm  than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster .  
0,i once thought that  the stoned age  was the worst film ever made . . . i was wrong .  hobgoblins  surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldn  t . in  the stoned age  i hated the characters . in  hobgoblins  i hated the actors . . . and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity . i won  t include a teaser to this film  i  m not that cruel . i couldn  t subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment . in fact  any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning . words i would use to describe this film are as follows insipid  asinine  and ingenuous .  br    br   in conclusion  please don  t watch this film . i beg of you  from one movie lover to another . . . no  from one human being to another  please . for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it . destroy any copies you come across .  
0,first of all  this plot is way overdone  girl wants to make it  everyone loves her  snobby girl intervenes  all looks lost  girl pulls through  everyone loves her again etc . throw in the fitting in thing  an attractive male crushing on the heroine  plus single  parent troubles and it  s so predictable that you can practically recite along with it .  br    br   second of all  i really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close  minded  in fact  i don  t recall the quote exactly  but i remember at one point in the movie  holly says   why do they have to be so uptight . . . so classical   it  s really insulting how label classical music in this way .  br    br   third  i  ve went over it dozens of times  but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears . there just isn  t any point at all .  br    br   and oh yeah  while the actress who portrayed holly  i  m not sure whether that was really her singing or not  had a reasonably good voice  it wasn  t as amazing as they were making it out to be  especially when she was belting . she was oversupporting the whole time .  br    br       stars .  
1,yeah  the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie . the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it . that  s just brilliant . joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life . the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating . a very nice family movie with  i concede  a rather corny happy end . but hey  it doesn  t really matter  the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes .  
0,to make any film about the supposed end of the world  there should be some facts  realism  . we are never told why these people believe this .  . location is new years eve in toronto canada . so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight  why  based on the costumes  did it seem like september  br    br    . the acting was in that neo  au  natural style  that needed a director who knew how to do it .  br    br    . the individual story pieces were all dreary  without any purpose . i could go on  but i do not want to make this as boring as the film .  br    br   rating      out of    on imdb scale  br    br   thank you i am as always  br    br   jay harris  aka  sirbossman  
0,that is the only question i am left with . why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast  why was the writing so bad  it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters  why did it not make any sense at all  why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and  hollywood  the hell out of it when all it needed was good  smart story telling  why  i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they  re released . i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey  who are oscar winners  that this never is released to the big screens in america .  br    br   as someone that holds a bachelors degree in journalism  the whole story is just utterly laughable . i just . . . think the script had potential  but the execution turned it into a clich  and an awful one at that . just . no .  
1,this is a quirky little movie  and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well .  br    br   it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist  and is partly about following his dream  partly about the dreams of others  and all about the travails of showbiz . i thought the movie was charming  and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile .  br    br   alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was  and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship .  br    br   not for everyone  probably  but if you like movies about the journey  then i think you  ll like this one .  
1,well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen . the effects are so bad you just have to laugh  and the acting  well lets say its no mel gibson . but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad  he becomes good . i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a   . you must see it if your in to horror  slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time . killer movie .  
1,i  ve spent years looking for a copy of this film    mm  dvd  vhs   so i could show it to my kids . the movie is funny  and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . they had to be that good to play that demented . i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages .  br    br   the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse  with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band  when not fighting the fires  . there  s the usual running gags  plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra . also  comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight  man hugh o  brien .  
1,that magical moment in life  that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood  and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about .  br    br   danni  wonderfully played by reese witherspoon  is right at that moment in life when the movie starts . she swoons over elvis  playing his records and wishfully thinking about love . maureen her sister will soon be off to college  has no trouble with attracting boys  is beautiful  and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn  t . she dates a local loser whos father is also after her  and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet . danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn  t good enough . she wants to be maureen but doesn  t see that she is beautiful herself .  br    br   the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time . court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers . he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun . on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping . they yell and argue and danni leaves . but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to danni  s to visit old friends  danni  s parents  . danni becomes attracted to court  and court to danni . she is a tomboy and is spunky  has attitude and says whats on her mind .  br    br   court is   and danni   and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm . by the time court kisses her one day  danni is smitten . danni  s father tells her to invite court to the house and he does . but things are uncomfortable for court on his  sort of date  . the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court . one look between the two and its all over . the looks of pain and defeat on danni  s face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time . the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters .  br    br   the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love  and the pain they must endure both together and individually . danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair  painful  and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started . few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly . this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind . its in the my top    movie list and deservedly so . i only wish more movies like this were made  because if so . . . my faith in hollywood would be a lot better .  
1,great little thriller . i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time . mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed . o such foolishness here . yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals . such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled . we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how inefficient the new hotel clerk was . we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose . the flight atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead . the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight . the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too . the only  characters that were just  liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane . that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot . from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge . even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn  t panic . she thinks what she can do to stall time . any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots . but not this one . it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast . thankfuly none of them were used . the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do  which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything  or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her . was craven should do more of these types of movies . also one last comment . brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was . i had to come over here to see that he is lisa  s father . he is completely unrecognizable .  
1,if you enjoy the subtle  yes  i said subtle  actions and reactions of john candy  you can  t help but like this film  pronounced  fillum  by salvatore dipasquale  . the unobservant  and uninformed  watcher always saw candy as a broad actor  a big buffoon . and sometimes he was  see  stripes  and  splash   . but  when given the opportunity  he could really be razor  sharp and quite subtle . it  s too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side  because we  ll never get to see more of the other . oh  yeah  the movie . one can watch  going berserk  over and over  i know i have  with the frequency of  caddyshack .  it  s just that good . the plot  although a little convoluted  is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind . it allows candy and the always under  rated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candy . . . and they bounce hard . definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candy  s other work .  
0,i  ve had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one . this is it   br    br   make no mistake this film is awful .  br    br   here  s a list of reasons  br    br   hopeless storyline  despite being based on a true story  . dreadful acting  what was judge reinhold thinking  unbelieveably bad stunts . childish dialogue . non  existent continuity . lack of atmosphere .  br    br   get the picture   br    br    
0,singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with . i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart however  this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous . in addition  there are a bunch of  might  makes  right  messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up . i mean  who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks  however  he way singleton portrays the  fight  is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else . there is another  bad guy   in reality a drunken frat boy  who rapes one of the movie  s protagonists . in this instance  i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one . in any event  he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas . i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape . well  no means no  this is a rape  which probably occurs a lot in universities across the country .  br    br   having established the rape  how does singleton deal with it  when the frat boy tries to call the woman  her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone  at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a  black bitch .  the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube  et al  who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged  apologies  to roommate for his racist remarks however the  apparently in singleton  s mind  lesser crime of rape is not mentioned . again  no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy however  singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks .  br    br   what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton  while no doubt a talented director  does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude .  
0,i  d give this a negative rating if i could . i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind . the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . oh how original if i were a   year old boy i might laugh at that . i have no idea how this movie became so popular . seriously  the worst thing i  ve ever seen . i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny  i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything . it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad . ridiculous actually . please do not waste your money on this movie . don  t even rent this movie . no clue how it  s getting such a high rating .  
0,  how she moves  springs to life only when its high  energy  talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera . otherwise  this stale strive  suffer  and  succeed story is low on energy  low on originality  and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other  likeminded films that have come before it .  br    br   rutina wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner  city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step  dance competitions  but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction . as noted earlier  the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing  but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting .  
0,this movie had a fairly good sounding plot  but the paste was very slow . . . very slow indeed . even if someone thinks this is a cult classic  i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched .  br    br   the cinematography is not excellent  but not the worst either . the sounds are ok . lighting ok .  br    br   i still wouldn  t recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film  student .  br    br   the movie does not contain music  and the horses having sex don  t make it a good one either . and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid .  br    br   no winnings here  skip this utter boredom . i  ve seen worse believe me  but this is just waste of time  and i don  t get the good reviews here . especially the high ratings . . .  
1,although i like kurt vonnegut  i  m not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn  t know this one . the only reason i watched it was nick nolte  who is one of my favorite actors since i saw  breakfast of champions  and  hotel rwanda  . but the film brought me a pleasant surprise . of course nolte was great  but so was the plot . there was relatively little political intrigue  and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti  semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans  he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans  and  as it later turns out  americans  towards jews or hitler . which carries more weight  his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti  semitism  the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken  not even as narration . howard campbell jr .  nolte  is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn  t open up  not even in his memoirs . the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray  but with the help of excellent acting and photography  this film manages .  br    br   there are other points to it  such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichs  like the song white christmas   that make it real different from average american movies . i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies .  
0,nine minutes of psychedelic  pulsating  often symmetric abstract images  are enough to drive anyone crazy . i did spot a full  frame eye at the start  and later some birds silhouetted against other colors . it was just not my cup of tea . it  s about   minutes too long .  
1,we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place  but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan  dom that i have never before approached  one of the most intense thrills of non  mainstream movie adulation  at least as far as i am concerned  is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure . i remember how  as a teenager  i longed to see eddie  s  revenge of the dead   a . k . a .  night of the ghouls    which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades . likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman  s  a night to dismember  or half the works of jesus franco  however  recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible  even for those of us on the  wrong     side of the atlantic . . . .  br    br   and then  behold  there was  i woke up early the day i died   a movie that should have been so  big   yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite . the     s needed a hard  to  find movie though which would really be worth hunting out and this  to be sure is it . . . . i don  t especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film  its classy  yet  kitsch cast  its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals  its wondrous moments of  pure cinema   in the sense of the     s french cineastes  and surrealism  or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack  since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here .  br    br   what i do wish to mention  briefly  is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost  lost  to  us  but  thankfully  not  quite movie  i think the german video  which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter  s day  is fairly well  known to ed wood  s followers now . it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released . however  there is thankfully more to be found    firstly  there are a number of reviews available from the film  s german theatrical release  i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to  woodify  my students . . . . . some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film  s artistry and entertainment value  and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions . secondly  there is the score by larry groupe   which can be acquired from the man himself  many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener  particularly if you are contemplating the film  s currently  vaulted  status and growing a little melancholy at the same time . finally  for now  i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers . beg  borrow  steal  kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these       it features   tracks from the film  including eartha kitt  s ballad  the late darcy clay  s  jesus i was evil   two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand  although that is another story again    the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances  and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv  the latter being billy z  s very own techno band  . . . . .  br    br   become obsessed  let ed wood rule your life .  
0,zombie nation     r  br    br   hey  i was bored . i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch . zombie nation  hey  i love zombie movies . says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description . funny how it doesn  t warn me not to watch this film . i could  ve used that advice .  br    br   zombie nation is just like troll  in that it  s completely misnamed . it has little  if anything  depending on your point of view  to do with zombies  and takes place all within one city . this film revolves around a crooked cop  who acts as badly as possible  he has to be trying to suck this much   while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them . yup  he  s a serial killer cop . not only is this film flawed in thinking that it  s a zombie flick  it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong . serial killers enjoy killing  they live for it and they get down and personal with it . this guy knocks out the women  and injects them with some poison . he doesn  t even have sex with the corpse or dismember it . talk about boring  eventually  one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason  all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy . they were all buried or tossed into the ocean  but you wouldn  t know it buy the sharp clean clothes they  re all wearing . the women then act very poorly and take their revenge . oh yay .  br    br   this film was crap in every category . crap acting  crap writing  crappier sets  and crappier make  up effects . the women don  t look zombie  like  unless you count really dark make  up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie . they can all talk  behave  think  and act perfectly human . the gore is weak compared to even many pg    films and the nudity is beyond brief . you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence . . . then the exact same breasts later  go figure . guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite . the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they  re obviously filming in . you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set  up and even  unless you are blind  you can see the director failing . steer clear  it  s a waste of time .  br    br        
1,  lion king      is the funniest non  theatrical release from disney . i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years . i remember first time i saw it i didn  t had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie .  br    br   is it better than  simba  s pride   in many ways  yes . though  simba  s pride  wasn  t exactly bad  it did suffer some problems lack of an good script and bad characterizations  which made impact of what otherwise a okay film .  br    br   anyway it  s nice to see timon and pumbaa  s personalities blossom again in the way that we  or certainly me  loved about them in this film in  simba  s pride  they were completely annoying and i didn  t liked the  timon and pumbaa  series neither .  br    br   this film could easily have been a stupid one  but fortunately the filmmakers didn  t took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious . there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own . the score is quite good . there are two new songs  which are catchy and two new characters  timon  s mom   voiced by recognizable marge simpsons  julie kavner  and uncle max  which are enjoyable . the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed . the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn  t feel out of place  which it could have easily done  especially in comedies  .  br    br   but is there something that distracts this picture from getting   votes from me  yes  there is . although they fortunately doesn  t impact too much  but i  ll mention them  . many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one . personally  it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones .  br    br    . during the climax  some of the jokes becomes lame .  br    br    . storywise  this is timon  s story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba  s  it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times .  br    br   but hey  those details doesn  t impact this otherwise amusing movie . it is the only really acceptable disney sequel  which should be in every movie collection .  
1,la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film . everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning . it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access .  br    br   this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film  s tale . i must advice that this is not a sample film .  br    br   please enjoy     
1,as usual  hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie . but  this one is a classic  from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman   well done . even facial expressions were great  language was perfect  even in russian language  and nicole did a splendid job   hey guys  you get what you pay for   
1,i  m not a writer or an critic . . . i  m just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago . . . . and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie  it is not the best or the most . . . . but it touched my heart . . . why    i would like to understand it myself . . . it is easy and accessible . . it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it  it is about love and caring  about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff . . . . . . . look at all the time that we have but we miss it . . . . why a fuk do we do that    we need to live like were dying . . . care about every second and rememberif we do good things  good things come back to us  happiness is real . . . and it has a special taste in new york . . . i love this town and the world the we live in     thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes  english is my second language  . . .  
0,it is so sad . even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake  there  s nothing out there  . the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i  ve ever heard . i like the brother and sister in this movie . they both don  t try very hard to sound sarcastic when they  re saying stuff like  my friends are going to be so jealous   hey  whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning  thats retarded  i practically ignored the second half of this . my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe . the same exact sound for every chop   
0,soldier blue is a movie with pretensions pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man  s inhumanity to man  on the white man  s exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples a biting  unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam . well  sorry  but it fails miserably to be any of those things . what soldier blue actually is is pernicious  trite  badly made  dishonest rubbish .  br    br   another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies . what it is basically is a lame  clichd  poorly acted  odd couple  romance  strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other  s lifestyle and falling in love  ah  bless   bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn  t have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick .  br    br   there is no excuse for the repulsive  prurient  gore  drenched climax  in which cute little native american children are variously shot  sliced  dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close  up  and large  breasted native american women are molested  raped and strung up  no excuse  that is  except box office .  the massacre itself  whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention  is very badly staged and shot a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them  intercut with a few special  effects sequences of beheading  dismemberment  dismemberments  incidentally  which utilised real amputees in their filming . now that  s what i call exploitation .   br    br   forget all the pap you  ve heard  including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie  about this being a  protest   an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples . this film doesn  t give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters  would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless  faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax . instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss  lousy actors both  in this at least   with plenty of blood  guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious .  br    br   which is a terrible shame  because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre  about all of the real life massacres the us  and britain  and all so  called  civilised  nations  have participated in over the centuries  iraq   . this just isn  t that movie .  
0,when teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichs that you can guarantee will follow .  br    br     the teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local . dan van husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly sirens . what  who  how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst .   the van will break down .   whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about .   they will find a house inhabited by a madman  he will capture them .   the house will have a phone but it will not work  it will be disturbingly decorated  there will be flickering neon light  spiders and maggots .   the madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won  t start  here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor  .   the madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap  weak scare and will then be killed properly .   only a girl will be left alive from the group .   there will be an unnecessary twist at the end .  br    br   add to these elements naked sirens  who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately  that seduce and kill the teens  throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie .  br    br   i think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but i am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film  darkhunters  which is one of the worst films i have ever seen . at times the cinematography is very good  the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies . i was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity . however  the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film  it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again  but amongst the dvd extras .  br    br   if you do rent this film i implore you to listen to the director  s commentary it is beyond belief . there is more to say about this than the film itself . one staggering part of the commentary is the director  s claim that the film is clich leaden because it was a preconceived idea . he says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichs and openly he wonders if  people will get it  .  br    br   i  m afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichs within them then it is not wittily scripted enough  acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work . if this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question  what was the point   this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies  any attempt to do something clever or different haven  t worked .  br    br   the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats . they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use . however  the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary . there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style  roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant .  br    br   the best moment is reserved for robert  s comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film . those who didn  t like it are generalised as  geeks  and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that . i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn  t singled out for ridicule . the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers  complete with  hilarious  accents to imply that people from norway wouldn  t know a good film simply because of where they are born . as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting  they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant .  br    br   the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast . robert  s swears blind in voice over   i didn  t want to make a film that was like baywatch  as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground . there is also a simpering  self  indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert  s says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is  the best british film in years  . i don  t know who he is trying to convince . at one point in the commentary track robert  s says jokingly  i can see people sitting at home saying  this isn  t amazing  its sht  he isn  t wrong .  
0,this film had a lot of promise  and the plot was relatively interesting  however the actors  director and editors seriously let this film down .  br    br   i feel bad for the writers  it could have been good . the acting is wooden  very few of the characters are believable .  br    br   who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film . there are lots of quick  flashy  edits in almost every scene  which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying .  br    br   i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no  it left me feeling like i  d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money .  
1,the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies . i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since . i ended up seeing it  times in the theaters  and if it was playing today i  d go out to see it again .  br    br   now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads . matthau was brilliant  but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack nicholson  s oscar winning performance of randall p . macmurphy in  one flew over the cuckoo  s nest . burns did win  though richard benjiman deserved at least to be nominated as well . even the smallest roles were played to perfection  like fritz feld auditioning for the potato chips commercial .  br    br   which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film  the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross . ross who previously brought a two person play   the owl and the pussycat  to the screen and made a full movie out of it  does it again . he opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play . he fleashens out the story and the characters .  br    br   here we  re   minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play  where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special . though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes  the sequence itself is totally new . a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack klugman and tony randall  which was wonderful . but i think that ross and screenwriter  playwright simon improved on it . it  s just a wonderful film .  
1,i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were  years old  but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that . the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies . so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little . i  m   years old and the ending still gets to me . all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i  m shocked honestly by this rating of  .   i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well . i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun .  br    br   charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog  carface . but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that can  t stop ticking or that  s the end of his life again . when he and his best friend  itchy  look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money  he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races . charlie takes the girl  ann  marie  and makes fake promises in order to get the money . but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann  marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance .  br    br   all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film  it  s not disney  but this is an excellent family film to watch . not to mention that it  s just so cute and touching . i know it  s ridicules and some people call me crazy  but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls . how could they not  they  re just so loving  and i think i  m going to cry again . but anyways  i would just recommend this movie for anyone  it  s a fun movie to watch .  br    br        
1,those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie  she is just plain cool  her car is great  and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton  she is so innocent and naive at times  and sexy all of the time  plus  more than a touch of mae west   br    br   the sets are well done as well  and the comic cast is great  with edie mcclurg at her usual best  plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious . any time i have to crunch something for a topping  i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips   br    br   this movie is one to be watched again and again  just for the fun of it . now i have to get the sequel to it  elvira  s haunted hills  and see if it lives up to this one      
0,ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box  gives this kid with shaggy hair  wishes  the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what  shaq sucks at rapping  and i guess thats it .  br    br   so mainly i laughed  i cried . . . . . . but mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player  rapper and boy with shaggy hair .  br    br   i highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh .  br    br   i  m going to give it a  out of   only b  c the movie is based off of  magical wishes .  br    br   if i had  wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn  t waste money on making this .  
1,very funny film . classic film funny eddie murphy of the   s . i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory . the classic irony of murphy does not fail  the film is funny  well done . murphy in the    s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous . the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from     up to now have changed . the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period . a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy  an actor who has recently disappeared . the final part is anthologies  the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk . that  s it .  
1,this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel . although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular  pride and prejudice    emma  is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen  s novel   especially considering its short length . the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one  as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma  s character in the rest of the book . i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well  picked . kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow  s    version . samantha morton  s wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book . mister knightly  s role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much  neglected  sumptuous film .  
0,the title above is used to introduce the film  gen  to its audience . gen is about a young doctor  doga rutkay  with an ill mother . the film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job . while she drives  we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area . as soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital  she sees the death body of a patient . this is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days .  br    br   two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide . in fact  they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions . all their communication with outside world is cut off too . there is no way out   in those few days  there will be more nasty murders . now everybody suspects from each other .  br    br   in my opinion  the idea is brilliant . it could have been very scary indeed . there are positive sides of the movie of course . i really like the beginning of the movie . especially  when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital . actings are okay . some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though . i think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie . what i am saying is  it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end  we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening . the director needed to explain it altogether which i think didn  t work well . also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least   years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital . lastly  i would like to say a few things about the director . i am sure he will improve . this is his first attempt . i have recently found out that he is only   years old . that made me feel more positive about him and his future films . i am not going to rate this film  out of  though .  
0,barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story .  br    br   to have a chance at obtaining an education  babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn  t the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy  anyway . at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she  s a guy .  br    br   don  t miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs  male friend thinks she  s a man  but pins  him  to the ground  sits on top of  him   and looks affectionately into  his  eyes . . . . snicker .  br    br   mediocre film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting .  
1,i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable . the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft  core porn . in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks .  perhaps for sex as well  but not on indian tv  anyway .   br    br   not being a fan of the genre i couldn  t place jeff wincott  and had no leads to search from . only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic  nurse coif  so mayoral   for the high  top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her .  br    br   this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early    s couture or nod  and  wink schlock  la paul verhoeven . can we add a genre tag for  so  bad  it  s  good    
1,i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date . this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen . it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out . chris gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay . the performances from stephen rea  donald sutherland and jeffery demunn are flawless . a masterpiece of the genre .  
1,if you fast forward through the horrible singing  you will find a classic fairy tale underneath . christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role . his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots . the other actors are well for their parts . i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward . the king in particular appears a real dunce though  and i wonder if he is supposed to be . i can not remember the original tale . the special effects are typical of the eighties  but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today . overall  i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart .  
1,i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of     . i am absolutely crazy about the show . i think the entire cast is excellent . it  s one of my favorite show ever . i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule . that is really sad . i hope they will bring it back . . . maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby  or is it only my wishful thinking   br    br   i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks  similar to mine . i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up .  
0,here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film  a sub  genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so . i  ve heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies  including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie  and as much as i hate to be redundant  the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything . the punch bowl over poor jeremy  s head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie  hey everyone  this is the director  and the following is my carrie  rip  off scene . enjoy    . but that  s just a suggestion .  br    br    spoilers  the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured . we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning  she gets killed  people wonder in the old oh  but  that  stuff  only  happens  to  other  people tone  and then they start to get killed . the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful  but they have no idea how to do it . take jason  for example . here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had  and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated  he is assumed to carry some significance . besides that  and more importantly  he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade  and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine  s day cards .  br    br   it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects  and jason is a perfect example of the effort  but not such a good example of a successful effort . sure  i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer  but that  s not the point . we know from early on that he is terrible with women  which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film  but then in the middle of the film  he appears at a party  smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls  and then gives them a hateful look and walks away  disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation . we already know he is a cardboard character  but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him .  br    br   on the positive side  the killer  s true identity was  in fact  made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also  unfortunately  yet another rip  off . early in the film  when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel  he makes no sound  suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female  rather than a male as everyone suspects . but then for the rest of the film  we just have this stolid  relentless  unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife . director jamie blanks  who  with all due respect  looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade  mentions being influenced by halloween . this is  of course  completely unnecessary  because it  s so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film . the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer  s is that michael  s mask was so much more effective and he didn  t have a problem with nosebleeds . this stuff is shameless .  br    br   at the end  there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is  complete with slow and drawn out and  the  killer  is  mask removal   but then we see adam  s nose start to bleed as he holds kate  his often reluctant girlfriend  and we know that he  s been the killer all along . nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act  and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film . valentine is not scary  i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight  and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember  and even i wasn  t scared   and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren  t so obvious that they were just going to die . i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews  although the film was in and out of the theater  s faster than battlefield earth   but the end result is the same old thing .  
1,i am of  the christopher reeve generation  it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet  but that doesn  t stop me from enjoying other actors in the role  and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top  though he just barely falls short . that doesn  t stop me from enjoying this film  it has a lot going for it . it has all that a movie needs  a plot with beginning  middle  and end  plus all those parts are intelligently written . the film is edgy both in acting and storyline  something a film  noir but with tights . the story is both exciting and meaningful  this is a movie with a message that isn  t too preachy . i am still amazed this was shot over   days  oh the glory days of hollywood  when we didn  t have to wait  years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell . . . the film is polished and expertly made  directed by lee  roll  em  sholem  best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down  in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight  including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman  s point of view  also a few closeups of george in process work  and a long shot of an animated superman .  br    br   this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series . a dvd worth owning in its own right  the inclusion of the film as its original whole  is icing on the cake .  br    br   give blood today god bless   
1,  and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom   anais nin marcel proust says   the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes .  author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the u . s . navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes . based on his autobiography  finding fish  written many years after the events  his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher  denzel washington  s first directorial effort . it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one  s past to being able to live life in present time .  br    br   required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base  the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone  derek luke  recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport  denzel washington  . he is at first unwilling to talk  but when he begins  the floodgates are opened . after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison  he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years  suffering humiliation and sexual abuse . according to antwone  the treatment by his foster mother mrs . tate  novella nelson  who referred to him only as  nigga  and by his cousin nadine  yolonda ross  was in fact much worse than shown on the screen .  br    br   the only friend he has is a local by named jesse  jascha washington  who  later in the film  only adds to his feelings of abandonment . it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke  though the film  s attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile . davenport  s humanity and warmth  however  allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl  joy bryant   his new girlfriend who is also in the navy  supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough .  br    br   with cheryl  s help and dr . davenport  s counseling  antwone develops enough self  esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past . what comes through in derek luke  s incredible performance is antwone  s longing for acceptance  dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him . comedian mort sahl once said that  people just have to remember what we  re all here for to find our way home . . .  antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep  not knowing the joy of being loved .  
0,this was one of the most boring  horror  movies that i have ever seen . a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz . trying to deliver a mix of  nightmare on elm street  and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad   s music video  this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story . although  being such a bad  and often laughable movie  dig those mullets and the terrible dialog   it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater     . don  t be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the     winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction  fanatasy  and horror  or that devo contributes to the soundtrack  or that tony basil has a part in the film . it is a giant disaster  though one with a small cult following  see the other imdb comments for this film  .  
0,the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course  it  s a textbook example of how not to make a movie . watching the movie and then listening to the writer  director  s commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them . call me old  fashioned  but i think of movies as a means of communication  and communication isn  t complete if the audience doesn  t know what the hell the director is talking about . the director  s avowed purpose is to make a movie void of  hollywood conventions  . among those conventions  alas  is consistency of character and clarity of concept . the director himself realizes that audiences often don  t understand points where he has purposely avoided a  hollywood clich  . however  he never seems to grasp the idea that clichs exist for a reason . they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly . it  s fine to avoid them  but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea  not simply eliminated . the film is built on an intriguing premise  rich with potential . two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii . soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them . someone with less disdain for the  hollywood convention  of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea . this film certainly isn  t it  the puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters  but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script . in particular  i  m becoming increasingly impressed by gonzo  who plays the lively corpse . in a number of muppet films  he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet .  
1,the good thing about this film is that it stands alone  you don  t have to have seen the original . unfortunately this is also it  s biggest drawback . it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed . sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie . forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original  
1,i like this film for several reasons . i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi . i also enjoy films  like topkapi and big deal on madonna street  that spoof the the genre . one of the best ones is disorganized crime .  br    br   corbin bernsen has met four cons over the years  and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town . but he hasn  t given any details on the crime to the fellows  nor do they really know each other at all . shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen  ed o  neill and daniel roebuck  whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back . while he is in their custody the four cons  fred gwynne  lou diamond philips  ruben blades  and will russ  show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something .  br    br   the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other  with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other . at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from o  neill and roebuck again  not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed . the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film the four cons trying to figure out what bernsen  s scheme was  and how to put it into operation  and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin  and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of  . there is also a third  smaller  plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hair .  br    br   there are many delightful moments in the film  such as axton  egged on by o  neil and roebuck  into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of  and yelling  through a megaphone   come out  we have you surrounded     only to have the scene switch to a huge  montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment . there are moments of misadventures by our four cons  who fortunately put the oldest  gwynne  into leadership position . this does not always guarantee anything . at one point their car won  t start  and they have to thumb a ride by truck . unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure .  br    br   the conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery  including disabling all the police cars at the critical time  philips specialty is cars  is also a gem of timing  suspense  and comic results . the film is very entertaining  and certainly worth watching .  
1,i don  t agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the american international pictures . basil deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war england  but without the sentimentality of  blackboard jungle   . the cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate . the estate looked like an old prison . stanley baker was excellent as the hardened detective  reassigned to the juvenile division   urgent  urgent  larceny  five iced lollies      he finds he is the butt of many jokes . david mccallum showed that he was one of britain  s top young talents of the fifties .  he had a very different role in another stanley baker film  hell drivers   . his portrayal of johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening . ann heywood was also very good as the cynical cathie . i wouldn  t say there was a romantic subplot in it .  br    br   detective jack truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the  firefly  . just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough  he is assigned to the juvenile division  he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work . amid all the heckling he gets his first call out  the  year old murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops     br    br   taking the twins home he meets their brother  the charismatic johnny  and their embittered sister cathie . he starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals . as he gets more involved with the family  he realises there is a strong link between the fires  johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry . the local priest  peter cushing in an unusual role  away from the hammer horrors  explains that when johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero . he wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires . the school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children  s fear  the teacher  thinking only of her own safety  runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman      br    br   i thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems britain experienced after the war .  br    br   highly recommended .  
1,  sorry for my faulty language  i am no native speaker . . .   br    br   yes  this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction . personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around . but i won  t use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here . because those  perfect  the one  and  only  best  ever    reviews make some people turn away  including me  .  br    br   so if you are looking for another  hamlet  that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones  then don  t miss this one  if you happen to find it anywhere .  unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it . it seems there is no dvd out there  and the german language version  which is quite well done  is not available in any format .   br    br   just in case you decide to get a copy spare out that cut down two hours  or so  version of this movie . it is no use and no fun  and gives a wrong impression of a movie  that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture . and its also crippled down to    aspect ratio .  br    br   greetings from germany  f . l .  
0,the original lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre . it  s pure adventure sf with some substance  here and there  and i  ve always wondered why hollywood hasn  t filmed it verbatim because it  s just the kind of thing they love massive explosions  super  weapons  uber  heroics  hero gets the girl  aliens  great cgi potential   good versus evil in the purest form  etc etc . instead  and bear in mind i  m a japan  o  phile and anime lover  we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story  mixes in star  wars  ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally  pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to  thundercats  level . to see kimball kinnison  the epitome of the galactic patrol officer and second stage lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful  etc  . i just can  t understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money  far   by telling straight . it makes no sense .  
0,anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies . this movie was an insult to watch  the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography . the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion  the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first   minutes through the rest of the movie . someone mentioned that this film was about a child  s imagination  okay thats all good and fine . but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did . i mean come on  the indian in the store . did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo  which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here  so you think okay creepy ghost scenario  but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy . that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic . the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg    why the hell did i just waste my time watching this   this is a move that i recommend not to watch  there are definitely better quality films out there that won  t insult your intelligence  thank god i never had to pay to see this movie  i would have demanded my money back  for those that were easily entertained by this movie . . . . it  s very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie .  
0,genghis cohn is a  very  mildly entertaining british movie about a german police commissioner in the late      s who is haunted by the ghost of a jewish comedian that he killed   years earlier while serving under hitler in the ss . the ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a jew to atone for the murders he committed .  br    br   otto  the german policeman actually knows this ghost  s name because  the last thing he did before he died was said  in yiddish  kiss my ass  . the policeman didn  t speak yiddish  so he asked around until he found the meaning . the kiss my ass  left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian  s name  genghis cohn .  br    br   there are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner  and there are no helpful clues . the men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher . the butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich  so the commissioner is a suspect . the first man is killed while making love to the butcher  s wife  so the butcher is a suspect . but the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife . all the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking .  br    br   i think i might be a bit angrier than the ghost of genghis cohn if i was killed like he was . he seems to be very good  natured about it  as if he was just in a mild car accident . i can only guess that it is because it is a british movie and they are known for being a very polite people . he uses some of his material from his stand  up routing  and i just didn  t find it very funny .  br    br   i gave this movie a  because it was just kind of goofy . i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was . the movie turns out to be a murder mystery  where did this come from    and it seemed that genghis should have been more helpful than he was . the movie gave me a tiny look into jewish culture  but was only skin  deep . do all jews love liver and onion sandwiches  do they all say shtoop  and meshuganah  in their daily vocabulary  isn  t there more important stuff that we should know about the culture   br    br   i saw this movie at a jewish community center in berkeley  ca  and i was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white .  i have no gray or white hair .  there were   of us  and after the movie they stayed for about   minutes to discuss the movie . there were  main concerns expressed there  . the movie was way too light  hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and  . as the holocaust survivors are dying off  future generations will not know what really happened . i thought that this second concern was ridiculous and i told them i thought they didn  t need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies  like myself . the murder of          people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten . i write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day .  
1,the cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team  networth  vs . the supposed professional team  magna  but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you  d be right . while the magna team has struggled at times  the street team has simply disintegrated week after week .  br    br   first some things to reiterate as far as the  apprentice   first of it continues the same absurd mentality  from trump  and the game in this series if your a good project manager  but you lose  the team will turn on you and you will be fired  despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs . simply absurd  that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually  weeds  out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol  br    br   anyone this season  weve seen a total of cursing  backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns .  br    br   the list of victims so far cast tara dowdell  audrey evans  danny kastner those three are the only that i feel were unfairly fired by trump  the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict  anger and suffering . it  s just amazing as one candidate audrey evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game .  br    br   yes its the game  it  s  the apprentice  where manipulation  backstabbing  and always popular  everyone gang up on the project manager  mentality rules .  br    br   it has been an entertaining ride  though  the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses  to building of new apartments .  br    br   still though it  s still the  apprentice  though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner .  
1,i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king  s books  this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable .  br    br   i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart  wrenching as well as scary .  br    br   the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out . and the  no fair  uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance .  br    br    
1,if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it . it  s quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it  s not didactic . in my opinion it  s a piece of art . . . beautifully filmed  fine music of many styles  the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama . nathalie press  billed as  natalie  press  is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate . celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually  normal   but the real star as always is timothy spall  surely one of the greatest actors of our time   
1,an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early      s . audiences must  ve been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle . quite a contrast from his  public enemy   years earlier . cagney does add spark  interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline  plot . but the highlight of the movie is the  elaborate production numbers back to back . first with the conservative  honeymoon hotel  number  then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling  by a waterfall  sequence  followed by the closing  shanghai lil  sequence  cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler . the  shanghai lil  number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown  anti climactic after the more exciting  incredibly mind boggling  by a waterfall  choreography . if i was the director i would  ve inserted the  shanghai lil  number in the middle  close with  by a waterfall   which blows the other  numbers out of the water so to speak  in my view the best of the  numbers . the  production numbers are the frosting on the cake  james cagney  s performance is added decoration to the cake . an outstanding musical achievement  a  star movie  the ultimate musical  well worth watching  you won  t be disappointed           
0,where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk  evil doctors perform their experiments  madmen hold the ultimate karate championship  and the uber  rich hunt humans for sport  i had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there  but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location  you  d have to assume that there are at least   of these suckers out there . it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device . hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands  so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began .  br    br   the island in this movie used to belong to dr . moreau  but has recently been purchased by the re  animator himself  jeffrey combs . old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research  which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer . if that sounds familiar  that  s because this is roughly the same basic set  up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea  not to mention a host of other nu image movies . so apparently  jeffrey  s son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny . he did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth  turning his son into a shark  man .  br    br   william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor  s experiments . if someone would have given him a sailor  s hat  william would have been a dead ringer for the skipper from gilligan  s island . in typical bond villain fashion  the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son . not chums  like buddies . . . chum  like shark food . so enter shark  boy who starts stalking the skipper and his cohorts all over the island . they  of course  make half  hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark  man suit .  br    br   the movie didn  t make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands . it  s funny that this movie is called hammerhead  it made me think of an old joke . why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer  because it feels so good when you stop . that  s pretty much how this movie is . the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it  s over .  
0,all internet buzz aside  this movie was god awful . i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything . instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller  horror movie  and they completely missed . there were only a few good parts  and a couple good lines by samuel jackson . other than that  it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes . all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie . now that the movie has actually come out  hopefully this joke will die . don  t waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash . if you  re looking for something that  s funny and entertaining  then just go to snakes on a blog .  
0,the first ten minutes of  just looking  really dictates the direction most of this movie takes . lenny  ryan merriman  is a   year old boy living in new york in the    s . he has a burning desire to see two people have sex . who are the best people he has in mind  well  his own mom and stepfather of course  how pleasant . unfortunately for lenny  he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle  s wife .  br    br   lenny  s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex . however  the wife is quite pregnant and they aren  t currently sleeping together . then lenny makes a new friend . him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls . they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex . the problem is . . . it  s not done in an innocent  charming      s sort of way . i am no prude by any means  but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation  blowjobs and anal sex . that kind of rawness may work in a movie like  kids        but in this film it just seems perverted .  br    br   gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy  a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny  s carnal desires . jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director  s chair as possible .  for better or worse        was awful and now this . what a waste .      
0,ah  channel  of local mexican t . v . everyday  at     a . m . they air horror movies from the    s to early      s . it was  return to cabin by the lake  the movie that aired yesterday . i regret for watching it .  br    br   the original  cabin by the lake  was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted . the problem is that this sequel is horrible  not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original . ugh . the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word .  br    br   the movie at some points looks like a soap  opera because of it  s absurd dialogs  cinematography  and direction .  br    br   my advice is  avoid this one at all costs . it  s a movie that it shouldn  t be watched by anyone . not even for lovers of mediocre film  making .  br    br   you have been warned .  
1,cashing in on the  demons  meets  clergy  trend of the late    s  early    s that most prominently included the triptych of  rosemary  s baby    the exorcist   and  the omen    the sentinel  is an addition that  s just as good  albeit the most overlooked of the lot  . in a way  it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of polanski  s  the tenant   which came out the same year  for good measure . a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss  coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor  the brilliant burgess meredith   plus the other off  center tenants . kept awake by loud noises above her apartment  she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building . from there  director michael winner   death wish   kicks this supernatural thriller into gear  and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine . aided by a brilliant ensemble cast  a subtle storyline  and excellent makeup fx by dick smith   the exorcist     the sentinel  is a genuinely creepy horror flick .  
1,the word  classic  is thrown around too loosely nowadays  but this movie well deserves the appelation . the combination of neil simon  walter matthau  possibly the world  s best living comic actor   and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece . it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns  part  as had been planned . as it is  the reunion scene in matthau  s apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter . definitely one of my desert island films .  br    br    enter            
1,romantic comedies can really go either way  you know  you  ll see one that  s really sappy  and you  ll think you want something more realistic . then  you  ll see one that  s realistic  but it might be too dull to keep you interested . or maybe you  ll see one that does everything right  but just fails to make you smile . romantic comedies are tough movies . you go into them with a lot of expectations  and usually  whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you .  br    br   of course  if you  ve got a girl next to you  and you  re a guy like me  it probably doesn  t matter all that much whether the movie  s any good  you  ve got other things on your mind . for you  i say   go get her  tiger   for the rest of us  i say   see  a guy thing  .  it  s a lot of fun .  br    br   because  a guy thing  knows you  re going in to this movie with expectations  so it doesn  t pretend that its  guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams  and it  s not his wife   plot is going to make everyone happy . sure  maybe you like it  but maybe it doesn  t ring true  or you think it  s cruel .  a guy thing  covers that . what  a guy thing  does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i  ve seen in a long time  so if you don  t the main plotline  you  ve still got something to make you smile .  br    br   whether we  re talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen  like larry miller  pretty woman  best in show   james brolin  traffic   julie hagerty  airplane    david koechner  saturday night live and conan o  brien regular  dirty work  austin powers ii  or thomas lennon  the state and viva variety   or new faces like shawn hatosy  the faculty   or colin foo  saving silverman   we  re talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film  s inspired characterisation  steal the show  time after time  and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days .  br    br   and that  s not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along  because it  s very sweet and terribly well done . jason lee  mallrats  chasing amy  dogma  etc .  is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control  and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is .  br    br   a lot of the success of the movie  though  falls on julia stiles  the right girl in the right place at the wrong time  and she wears it well . not since  gosh  i don  t know when  have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy . of course  it  s all in the closeups  the voice  and the subtle smiles  but it  s magical  and it  s one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place .  br    br   but julie stiles  s slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead  on in their classic simplicity . this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types  makes them fall over each other to make you laugh  and then comes through with a great deal of heart .  br    br   a guy thing is a movie you  ve definitely seen before  and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it . we haven  t really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl . a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge  often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play .  br    br   for the record  it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy  so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it .  br    br   and guys  i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee  s friends in this movie . i  m not going to spoil it for you  but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema  i suggest you just say  it  s a guy thing   and leave it at that .  
1,next to  star wars  and  the wizard of oz   this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made . it  s a true shame it  s not as well  known as the former films  maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci  fi settings  and that it  s british  meaning a smaller market for films  but its wonderful to know that it  s deserved that reputation .  br    br   like all great family films  one can be a child  an adult  or even a teenager to enjoy this film  i  m currently     but one must appreciate classic films first . i absolutely adore this film . it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa  perhaps my favorite classic film score  that rivals any john williams  star wars  score  a fast but not flashy pace  beautiful sets  dialog  and use of color  both the sets and cinematography won oscars   and state  of  the  art oscar  winning special effects  for the time  and some are still stunning  . and  of course  june duprez  s sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta  jones   she even looks like jones in a way   .  br    br   in conclusion  this is one of my all  time favorite movie  next to  the adventures of robin hood   and it truly deserves more attention . it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout  and  along with  robin hood   it  s my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed .  br    br   stars   excellent   
1,i have not read the novel  though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this  coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre  leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book . having not read a single word of austen  s writing  i really can  t compare this to any of her work . what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever  witty  and well  delivered  as well as the biggest source of comedy in this . this made me laugh out loud a lot  with perfect british and verbal material . every acting performance is spot  on  and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker . the characters are well  written  credible and consistent . i did find a couple of them extremely irritating  however  and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny  it tended to get repeated excessively  and it honestly wasn  t amusing the first time they appeared . the editing and cinematography are marvelous  and everything looks utterly gorgeous . plot and pacing are great  you  re never bored . it does end in a really obvious manner  but maybe that  s what the audience of these prefer . i can  t claim that this did not entertain me  it did from start to finish  and i  d watch it again . there is brief language in this . i recommend this to any fan of romance stories .      
0,a recent post here by a woman claiming a military background  contained the comment  a woman  s life is no more valuable than a man  s  .  br    br   this mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show . societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population  sometimes with astonishing speed . germany was ready to fight another war in     despite the          war in which over two million of her men were killed . in south america  s war of the triple alliance        paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the     chaco war against much larger bolivia .  br    br   no society  however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population . only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight . israel faced that situation in     but since then has never considered coed combat units for its defense forces despite the popular image of the israeli girl soldier .  br    br    g . i . jane  is hollywood fluff .  
0,oh  for crying out loud  this has got to be the lamest movie i  ve seen all year  and i  m sorry the normally awesome john cusack was even involved in this brainless  twitty piece of stupidity . where sleepless in seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message  albeit on a more subtle  somewhat more mature level  serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer  and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so  and that  s an hour and a half of my life i  ll never get back again  thank you very much    . it  s bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen  year  olds  actually i  ve known better fourteen  year  olds . . .   except maybe for jeremy piven  who was enjoyable enough . just the first   minutes or so of the movie where kate beckinsale  s character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind  literally  had my best friend and i irritated beyond belief . i told my husband rockstar had more intelligence  and at least  the characters in rockstar weren  t half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this  serendipitous  mess . it  s annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives  and feel they  re nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate . how utterly tiresome . i  m sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who  d rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences . after all  here  s a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people  s lives  namely their respective fiances   not to mention other relatives and friends  just to get there .  br    br

0,this movie had some great actors in it  unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start . it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time . maybe it was the musical score or the director himself  but one thing is for sure the make  up artist needs to get another job  the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces  would not recommend this movie to anyone  no wonder it never hit the theaters . cuba gooding jr .  james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all . the plot was great just needed a whole lot more .  
0,i really wish that when making a comedy  the people actually tried to make it funny . this is a film that you can sit through  but nothing is special about it . after watching it  you will say that it was alright . it was not boring to watch  but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at . entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o . k . story . this movie wanted to be  tootsie   but instead it failed .  br    br   i gave it a  out of   .  
1,i liked this movie  although halfway through it  i was able to tell who the secret admirer was .  br    br   i am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the  real  people at the end of the movie . i guess i will have to research it and let ya know .  br    br   does anyone remember what state this happened in  i believe they moved to north carolina if i  m not mistaken .  br    br   of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent .  br    br   you would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as i did . was he stupid or what   
0,without question  the worst film i  ve seen for a long while . i endured to the end because surely there must be something here  but no . the plot  when not dealing in clichs  rambles to the point of non  existence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches set  pieces are clichd . worse  considering its co  director  the photography is only so  so .  br    br   comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter  long good friday or kaspar hauser are way way off the mark lives of the saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading . in short  their craft . a ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent    minute short  but as it stands it  s a  th form film project realised on a million  pound scale rambling and bloated with its own pretensions . that it received funding  surely only because of rankin  s name  while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry .  
1,it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as  dukes of hazzard  and  the hills have eyes   the new version  can find dvd distributors while older  and far superior works such as this film  are nowhere to be found . with all the on  going debate about the morality  or lack thereof  of warfare  and interest in espionage  consider the multiple jack ryan  bourne  xxx  and  mission impossible  productions  this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd . true  it looks like a     motion picture because it is a     motion picture . but style consideration aside  this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say  and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained . if nothing else  will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd  whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand  alone . i don  t know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products  but if you are reading this and other comments  please take us seriously . we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard  earned dollars spent on tickets  dvds and cds  give us what we want  all that said  if you are reading this and have not seen this film  lobby for it  s release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about . you will not be disappointed .  
0,i remember when this piece of trash came out  all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken barbra streisand years to get the film made . well it couldn  t have taken that many years the play only opened in      eight years previously . it made a broadway star of the great actress tovah feldshuh  who probably should have been cast in the film  but nooooo . . . the great star barbra had to do it her way . and with music no less  this film is a total disaster from start to finish . for one thing  barbra was forty years old when she made it and she looked every minute of it . there was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study torah . and then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy . i get the impression that streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make  up she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl . and as if that is not bad enough  she gets involved with both her schoolmate avigdor  mandy patinkin  whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end  and his fiance  amy irving  who does her usual sleepwalker routine  a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing  . yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl i won  t even bother to mention the  wedding night  scene .  br    br   then there is the music . nine totally forgettable songs  all sung by streisand via voice  over  presumably as a look inside her mind   and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard .  br    br   i won  t say that streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here some of the visuals are lovely  patinkin  s backside especially   and she has a good eye for balance . the problem with this movie is that she won  t get out of her own way . i did not believe her for one second in the title role she should never have added the songs  and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes . i was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty  five minutes .  br    br   awful  awful  awful .  
0,this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater . even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon it  s worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh  riot . really  it  s worse than  destroy all monsters .  be sure to check out the following the cheesy medallion  looks like the shriners have been here   the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on  allan quatermain   david macallum  s badly done stutter  which does draw attention away from his even worse acting   the incredibly bad process work on all the  monsters   the monsters themselves  the hand puppet which menaces the little girl  the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal  the red  lighted eyes on the motorized crabs  the amazingly hilarious boat  oh  brother    which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jr . sr . prom   voyage into the future with the class of       the phoenician city  where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions   the phoenicians invented the alphabet  come on    and worst of all  macallum and ekland  with her fright wig  playing smoochy  face  oh the horror  the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman  and the african guy  snuffleupagus or whatever  evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes .  
1,i was really excited about seeing this film . i thought finally australia had made a good film . . but i was wrong .  br    br   this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever . i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie .  br    br   the acting was terrible  especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent   and the plot was also pretty bad .  br    br   when i first heard about this film coming out  i thought that the title was pathetic  because it sounds like the cheesy film  stab  in scream    but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie .  br    br   warning    major spoilers     br    br   probably the worst thing about the film was the ending . i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was . . but the killer wasn  t even human . . which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie .  br    br   don  t see this film . . you  ll probably be disappointed   
1,i  m a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion  good  clean fun  good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show . how innocent we all were  and how innocent is diagnosis murder  . i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix . the bad guys always get caught  the good guys carry on . the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously .  br    br   one beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches  amanda was too dizzy . its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy .  br    br   i hope we haven  t seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens  esp . at lunchtimes    
1,this movie is just great . if you have a chance to see it  then you should run to see it . even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from      pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around .  br    br   pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great . if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words  if you saw it  then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them .  its quite sweet   br    br   even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time  not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct  it is still easy to follow along  but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything . personally  i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze  it is really just that great .  br    br   this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy   s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy . . .  so say good night to the bad guy   
0,this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see . terrible  terrible  terrible . any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker  the filmmakers family  or a friend of the filmmaker . how does this film suck  let us count the ways . . .  br    br   the plot  incoherent . dialogue  atrocious . i will not slam the effects  gore  as i understand that this is low budget . but was there even one zombie that was not obese  c  mon  and for a film set in rhode island  why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate  continuity  find some .  br    br   the girl dancing while the soldier  stands at attention  . please  don  t put your ex  girlfriend or buddy  s sister in your movie naked . this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people  and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover . next time you decide to make a movie  don  t .  
1,yeah  it  s low budget . yeah  it  s one of candy  s earliest films  but it is maybe his funniest  john candy was not so far removed from his sctv days in  going berserk  and it shows . if you don  t crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand  cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them  huh   see the movie    or the way euguene levy  the creator of kong fu yu  is talking to his mom on the phone  or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse  if you like the john candy of  only the lonely  this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see  but if you enjoy the sctv days of john candy  this movie is a must see   
1,i saw this film a couple of weeks ago  and it  s been stuck in my head ever since . it stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary . to get the true story of the beales  i had to wade through all of the dvd  s bonus material and commentaries and search the web .  br    br   although the maysles and their fans  not to mention edith and edie themselves  bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative  this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word . very little effort is every made to explain the beales or how they came to the condition they were in  the maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for edith and edie to say something outrageous . the sound  even on the criterion re  release is poor and difficult to follow . although i appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film  it  s ironic to compare it to geraldo rivera  s    far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at willowbrook state school in staten island from      four years before grey gardens was shot .  br    br   to paraphrase a review in the new yorker  there were many things edith and edie needed in their lives  and a documentary wasn  t one of them .  br    br   as for edith and edie  the thing i kept thinking while watching the film was  where the hell is their family   they were living in dangerous  unhealthy  unsafe conditions . how is it that jackie o  married to one of the richest men on earth  or the wealthy bouvier family themselves  couldn  t afford to get edith and edie a decent home  or at the very least hire a part  time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both  it  s shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire bouvier family .  br    br   although this review may sound negative i would strongly recommend grey gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries . perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary  bringing in the rich backstory  and afterstory  of the beales and the whole subsection of hamptons society in the      s .  
0,director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past  like  greedy  and  clue  . this isn  t one of them . more akin to a  police academy  film than its inspiration  it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors . but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act . nothing much happens  really . it  s all quite dull . it  s not very funny . martin  dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort  but they  re all better than this and it  s quite painful watching them work with such thin material .  
1,everything i remember about it was excellent . . . great cast with sam waterston  george innes  before he became more familiar to us audiences  . . . . excellent scripts as only the english can do  edwardian sherlock holmes  lord peter wimsey  albert campion type mysteries  but with a jules verne twist . sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england   years earlier . . . right at the beginning of the scientific  technological revolution of the   th century .  br    br   i  ve often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows . macgyver first aired about  years later .  br    br   i still have  episode on a much deteriorated tape .  
1,i  ve watched this movie a number of times  and found it to be very good . this movie is also known as  castle of terror    coffin of terror   and  dance macabre  . barbara steele  is her usual beautiful  creepy self . george riviere  the male lead  does a good job with his role . the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere  and there is a good deal of tension throughout . the camera angles are good and the acting  for the most part  isn  t bad . this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening . i have the dvd uncut version  which is far superior to the edited tv version . grab some popcorn  turn out the lights  settle back and enjoy . john r . tracy  
0,my kid makes better videos than this  i feel ripped off of the   .   spent renting this thing  there is no date on the video case  apparently designed by wellspring and  what  s even worse  there  s no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie  the only date given is      leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he  s getting a recent film .  br    br   this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made  that i  m amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video . it might be of interest to students studying the counter  culture of the      s  the anti  war  anti  establishment  tune  in  turn  on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case  there  s no hint that that is what you  re getting . if you do make the mistake of renting it though  it is probably best viewed while on drugs  so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors  fassbinder and fengler . regardless of your state of mind while watching it  i can tell you that it doesn  t get any better after the first scene so  knowing that  i  m sure you  ll be fast asleep long before the end .  
0,i was expecting to love this movie   film noir  serial killer  dark irony . i was baffled by many choices the characters made   hey  i know they  re creepy looking  but let  s hook up for a cross  country road trip anyway     found the pacing to be glacial  and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer .  br    br   thinking about it now  this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense  o  meter      model  before starting to film . . .  
0,darcy and her young daughter pamela are heading out to the country where her mum  s boyfriend peter left his doctor  s position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn . although this inn has a terrible past and pamela learns from one the girl  s who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house . they called her the  tooth fairy  as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth . this work on the inn  has awoken the  tooth fairy  . now she has her sights on pamela and her last baby tooth  but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits pamela .  br    br   this flick  s old folk myth of the  tooth fairy  doesn  t paint her in a very generous way  as you would believe when you were a child . don  t they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares  another one which did fall into the same category was  darkness falls        . i can  t compare how similar they are in the premises  because i haven  t seen the latter  but i mostly read they have basically share the same idea . for a little straight to dvd film  this dtv effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device . low expectations are needed  as i wouldn  t class it as an success  but i found it be to marginally entertaining .  br    br   cory strode and cookie rae brown  s story or background for this  tooth fairy  character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural . silly is a good way to describe what  s happening in this poorly scripted story  but it never really feels like a fairytale horror . the dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded . while the acting is simply sub  par with the bland characters they have to work off  but director chuck bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts . this kinda makes up for the lack of suspense  the zero scares and generic tone . his direction is reasonably earnest and visually able  where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography . the promising opening scene is creepily effective . his pacing can slow up in parts and there  s the odd and unnecessary slow  motion scene put in  but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that i wasn  t bored .  br    br   the make  up special effects provided the goods  as there  s enough repulsive gruel and the tooth fairy  s appearance is especially gooey . the figure of the tooth fairy can look threatening in its black robe  bubbling make  up and swift movements . being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness . child actors can be incredibly annoying  but nicole muoz was decent in her part . lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid  but can be a little too causal in their performances as peter and darcey . the radiantly gorgeous carrie anne fleming is one of their lodgers . p . j soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn .  br    br   i thought it was a okay time  waster that has a sound concept  which just isn  t fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff . watchable nonsense  but at the same time extremely forgettable .  
0,i saw this movie originally in the theater  when i was   . even at that age the  humor  was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence .  br    br   in the past  whenever i would see ed begley jr . or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad . until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today  i was unsure why i felt that way . apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained . apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen  nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work .  br    br   i haven  t been brave enough to try watching it as an adult . i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can truly put it behind me . some regression therapy and  or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either .  
0,greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists  add some commentary by a bunch of uber  right reactionaries  ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem  and presents this as the theology of islam . maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church  adding commentary by some militant atheist  scholars  and call their film  what the world needs to know about christianity .  ultimately  this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism . don  t waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you  ll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis .  
1,this is why i still have nightmares .  br    br   this terrifying film  a musical  was considered appropriate for children in the     s .  br    br   a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island . the mayor of the island  pufnstuf  allegedly a dragon  looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me  and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch  billie halliday  who was considered  a bit of alright  at the time  .  br    br   the flute is recovered at an  interesting  witches convention  with the witches having a gay old time . the boy dresses in drag then as a  fairy  to recover the flute .  br    br   not suitable for children .  
0,bob clampett  s  porky  s poor fish  is a so  so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments . set in porky  s fish shoppe   porky  s poor fish  occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black  n  white porky cartoon and one of the books  come  to  life merrie melodies that were popular at that time . typically of many of the early porky cartoons  porky is far from the star  appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film . for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for . unfortunately  the audience gets far less than they bargained for . as was sometimes the case in the books  come  to  life series  the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non  animated medium . laughs are scarce and  while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett  s energetic direction  there is very little at all to recommend  porky  s poor fish  over any of the other below  par early porky cartoons .

1,i work at a movie store  and as such  i am always on the look  out for an excellent movie . i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section  and i  ve been trying to support my country  s movie industry . i was in for a surprise . the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships . . . without working that hard . it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters  as well as some funny exchanges   we can  t be dead  we have cable    . what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot  even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .  
0,seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie osullivan defeating greame dott by   frames to  bbc  found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off  br    br   i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm  certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit  too brightly lit  cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasnt until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release  after all someone of mortensens stature wouldnt star in a tvm  i mean thats like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film . wait a minute  didnt bob . . . .   br    br   some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on  screen couple and i agree . i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl . the sixties was before my time but surely if youve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives its not really a choice at all . mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains it  br    br   i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact its a romantic drama at heart  just like youd expect in a tvm  with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene  it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were   something in     . i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock . in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them  
0,in short  the movie had a little bit of a weak  st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing  somewhat of a decent  nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast  and the  rd act . . . there virtually wasn  t any  rd act   br    br   regarding the  rd act  the movie just abruptly ends . there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the  nd act  so there wasn  t much of a  rd act . the bad guys die and that  s that the end credits roll . there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on . the audience would  ve likely left the theater after the movie  asking  that  s it   a real letdown .  br    br   music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time  but it  s certainly nothing outstanding . it  s just functional  but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative . it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion . what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from    hrs .  and  commando   particularly the brass .  br    br   in all  the film had potential as the basic story itself is good  but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction  weak acting  and somewhat inconsistent pacing .  br    br   there was virtually no  rd act to properly finish the story  and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn  t allow the movie to end satisfactorily . this could either be the screenplay or  possibly  the production had to cut out filming or editing the  rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints  but i  m speculating as to why there isn  t a  rd act  . whatever the reason  the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall .  br    br   this is good for a view if you  re curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the  acts  beginning  middle  end  if you write screenplays and make movies .  br    br   otherwise  you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst  k version to at least get some laughs out of it .  
1,to me  this review may contain spoilers  but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen  so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers   br    br   i just watched this movie again  and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie . ever . ever . ever . the real translation   the beating of the butterfly  s wings   is oddly not used as the translated title . i suppose they thought most americans wouldn  t know what chaos theory is  except for those who saw or read  jurassic park   . the movie is based on chaos theory  and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events  which all lead back to one event . the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect  as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters  about     . in a way  the ending seems inevitable despite this  but if you think about it  it is a perfect ending . think to yourself   what else needed to be said   it is at the same time a very brave ending . too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one  but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .  br    br    
0,this film is deeply disappointing . not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues  it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring . the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j . b . lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories . wenders  s introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly  alluding to world  s culture  or actually  american culture  traveling in space  but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the   s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid . yawn . i had expected more of him .  
0,this is the biggest flop of     . i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster . the songs have been added without situations  the story have been stretched to fill the  hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it  s like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with    people . only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish . . . akki is also done a good job . . . . but the movieee just forget it .  
1,the menagerie parts one and two was the only   parter during the   year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the  st pilot  the cage .  the move was made out of necessity  to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced  such a sf show back in the     s was a hassle to get done on time  . one positive outcome back then was that audiences  unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier  were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters  as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history  though they still used terms such as  united space fleet  in these early episodes  .  br    br   the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot the enterprise is diverted to starbase   for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans . astonishingly  though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock  s vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible  it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain  pike  now horribly crippled . well  spock is half human  we tend to forget . or has he simply gone mad  it may very well be  for he  s directing enterprise to talos iv  a planet so off  limits it  s the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet  s books . when the jig is up  there  s a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy  as uhura looks on in shock . even kirk  usually steady as a captain should be  doesn  t know what to make of his first officer  s illogical conduct .  br    br   in the  rd and final acts  we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from   years prior  when capt . pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers . we really don  t know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish  and that  s another thing that makes this a very good   parter  we really need to find out what it  s all about in the  nd part . not only is spock facing severe penalties  but it looks like kirk  s career may be finished  as well . double jeopardy  folks . this is also the  st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts  none were available in the earlier  the enemy within  when the crafts were really needed  . there  s also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase  this was the only way to visualize such things back then . finally  check out kirk  s smug approach at the start of the episode  boy  do things go sideways on him as the story progresses .  
1,plenty has been written about mamet  s  the house of games   most of it good . i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after   years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again . the film  s success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam . mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us  the audience  and the mark simultaneously . then he explains the art of conning only to do it again  etc . all the while building the story .  the house of games   now a freebie on cable  is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans .  b   
1,even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera  work and his timing . this is a thin story   and quite predictable at times   but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately . the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that   the rich  prince  will lose his fortune .  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clichs . then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living . the ending is very predictable but satisfying . i also want to compliment the title  writing very witty and fun .  
1,a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident . when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state  the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live . the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him .  br    br   this comes to us from director rob schmidt  who made  wrong turn   a film i have not seen  . with only one horror film under his belt  and not a particularly notorious one at that  i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode  expecting schmidt to be a  master of horror  in only the most liberal sense . my apologies to him for my underestimation . as of episode   in a   episode season  this was actually the best one yet .  br    br   the issue of the  right to die  is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device . however  this is only the foundation on which the story revolves . once the horror elements show up  the film goes from  decent  to  spectacular  . great acting  great plot  great dialogue  great suspense . i was a little creeped out at times  which is good  and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance  i read a review of this episode prior to watching it  where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of  hellraiser  in this . through the first part of the show  i had no idea what they were talking about . then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of  hellraiser   . however  i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film . i can see no other way to create the effect that was created  and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than  hellraiser   .  br    br   some plot twists show up later on  and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look . i didn  t watch it a second time  but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had  not that it  s confusing  . the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice  and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him . he  s somewhat of an anti  hero to the whole story  if you will . i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist  but he  s completely unlovable .  br    br   while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i  m excited about the  washingtonians  episode  i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine . when legends like john carpenter let me down  again  i get a bit worried about the genre  s future  but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope . this one is a keeper  and please bring schmidt back for season    
0,just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home . she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why .  br    br   this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn  t quite . i can  t really put my finger on why it didn  t work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better  or at least had gotten the little things right  like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size . i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong .  
1,this movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed . the book by rebecca west was written in      soon after wwi  when shell shock and trauma  induced amnesia were not clichs  as the reviewers call it many books and movies later . it is difficult to go back in time and live  as the characters lived  the realities of the time the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas  the british class system the wife thought all  important  the hopeless spinster  and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was   years ago .  br    br   alan bates as the amnesiac soldier who  will die  if he isn  t allowed to see margaret  the girl of his youthful dreams  builds on the devotion his character showed in  far from the madding crowd  . having seen that performance  it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn  t live up to the family  s and society  s expectations . margaret says   we quarreled  and as you rowed away  you turned your face away from me .  so we know that the breakup was something that he instigated  that it brought him shame  but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with margaret . i haven  t seen all his films  but in the ones i  ve seen  he imparts a strong masculinity  which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier .  br    br   i didn  t even recognize ann  margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated . not having read the book  i wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between jenny and chris  though jenny does state that she  is a cousin  . the way kitty keeps jenny in the nursery in the hair  drying scene  the fact that kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun  or sentiment about a lost child  and the statement she made that she wished chris hadn  t felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child . also  jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role  as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time .  br    br   having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover  non  sexualin keeping with the mores of the time  from   years ago  i couldrelate to margaret  s and her husband  s dilemma . i  too  was cast aside because i wasn  t good enough for his family  and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet  i was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn  t believe he loved . my husband  like margaret  s was very understanding  but the strain was very real . the lover was finally able to reconcile his real  life situation with his fantasy of loving only me .  br    br   i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris  s mind . i thought of  mrs . dalloway  with the wwi soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus chris  s joy in his fantasy of margaret . in contrast  the actiona of the soldier in  mrs . dalloway  seems overwrought .  br    br   showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced . everyone seems to get their life back  but was it the right choice   
1,normally i don  t like series at all . they  re all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast .  br    br   these series however  are well played  the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one  the story will still be catching your mind .  br    br   the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital .  
1,okay . this has been a favourite since i was   . granted  i don  t watch it multiple times a year anymore  but . . . this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message . this movie is fun . it  s pretty dated  almost passe  but parker posey is so brilliant that it  s unbelievable . if you want to be charmed by a    s breakfast at tiffany  s  attended    s raves  or love parker  this movie is for you . otherwise  don  t bother .  
1,this movie is great  it touched my stone cold heart . i couldn  t relate about the racial discrimination that antwone has experienced because i  m living in my own country . i guess it is really hard to be discriminated .  br    br   we watched this film in our sociology class in new era university  and i didn  t knew that it was a true story  i thought it was just created by an intellectual who want to bring a fresh air in the industry . it is very good .  br    br   the part that shocked me was when nadine abused antwone  who was just six  sexually . if i were on his shoes  i could have jumped a ten  story high building . i salute him for he being so strong   br    br   the scene that touched me here is when antwone finally saw his mother eva face to face . he did not bitched her or whatever  instead he told her about the achievements that he got within the long years that they have been separated .  i think i  ll do that when i get the chance of tracing my roots .   
1,this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting . mr . torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job . i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it . wonderful performances .  br    br   it gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally . great unheard of movie .  br    br   it was done when ms . farrel was very young . i had always thought of her as a comedian  but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful . there is very little dialogs  but that just make it seem more real . mr . torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling . i must see movie .  
0,are you kidding that was awful     br    br   but that notwithstanding i got given this film and  others and they were all on dvd . the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwards .  br    br   and the ending well let  s just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history . lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you . . . .  br    br        
1,simply well written  directed and acted . . . woody  s best of the      s if not his best since the    s   hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll . scarlett johansson  s banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become .  br    br   it  s refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady . he plays the perfect bumbling magician .  br    br   there have been a few reviews maligning this movie . don  t let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film . people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line . if you like woody allen films of the    s  you  ll regret missing this one .  br    br   i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind  if you do  you might walk out smiling .  
1,and laugh out loud funny in many scenes .  br    br   the movie  s basic plot is well chronicled  a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity .  br    br   this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau  s best film as co  stars  and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic .  br    br   the scene where oscar lines up a double date  leaves the room briefly  and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny .  br    br   for any fan of intelligent comedies  the odd couple is a  go out of your way to see it  film .  
1,this production of oliver is masterful in showing layers of evil in the human soul . what makes the story remarkable is a brilliantly bright unseen character  who pierces this darkness as he leads an innocent boy through the gravest dangers safely into the hands of his own relative . yea  though oliver walks through the valley of the shadow of death  he fears no evil . a rod and staff are there to comfort him . in the end  he is saved from the dregs of humanity . at the bottom is fagin  the most wicked of the lot . fagin contemplates repenting of his ways not once  but twice  yet declines because he is unwilling to pay the price . fagin is worse than bill sikes  because he raises little pickpockets who become murderers . in the middle is oliver . his innocence is unsullied  but untried as well . the best is nancy . lacking in judgment  she ignores bill sikes  violent nature out of her deep need for love . yet unlike fagin  at the probable cost of her own life  she does repent of her sins by saving oliver from bill . things are not as they seem . in my opinion  this quality is what makes art worthwhile  unpredictability . i would give this film a      but its     s made  for  tv soundtrack and ambiance were distracting . overall  a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences .  
0,i  m into bad movies but this has nothing going for it . despite what the morons above have said  it is not funny . i know comedy and underground movies but this is so boring that the director  writer should be prohibited from ever directing anything but local cable access ever again  to love movies and comedy is to despise this film . i may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was . if you like this movie you are a pothead as sober there is nothing here . zero  if you need to compare underground movies  see  kentucky fried movie  or early john waters . the movie starts by defining satire and i defy anyone to show me the satire . the rule for comedy is this . . . if it  s funny you can say or do anything but if it  s not funny you are not satirical  you are not edgy  you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny . zero   
1,louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well  made french melodrama . she plays a typist named lucienne who  despite being in love with a man named andre  dreams of rising above her position in life . she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe  but andre is furious when he discovers that she  s entered  then demands that she withdraw . she tries to take back her entry only to discover that she  s already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main pageant .  br    br   this is a story of love  loss and decision played out to its passionate end . the movie is very energetically filmed by director augusto genina and cinema tographers rudolf mate and louis nee . the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the    s  and shows the different style employed by europeans . there are many fast cuts and traveling shots  mostly done with great skill and verve . the high energy of the movie  s first third dwindles a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last   minutes .  br    br   the performances were very good by all the principals  but that of louise brooks is especially memorable . louise leans heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a talkie  but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary  understated feel  she makes the transition to talkies very well . the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation  of being trapped in a life she no longer wants . i doubt it  s ever been done better .  br    br   the film builds to a superb finale  artfully shot  powerful and stylish . this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film . and the tragic storyline only underscores the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks . she wasn  t just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a swimsuit  she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away . we are all the poorer for that .  br    br   this movie is less well known than her german films with g . w . pabst  but i think it  s a better one . i think this crew is just better at storytelling than pabst  and while prix de beaute may lack the deep moral complexity of the pabst films  it  s much easier to follow and is overall a more streamlined  focused piece of work . and it doesn  t hurt that louise  s singing parts are done by edith piaf  either .  br    br   bottom line  this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for .  
0,this is not a good movie . it  s disjointed  all the acting is bad  and has a lame story you  ve seen a thousand times done much better else where . not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away . worst of all  no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she can  t sing . but who cares  she  s sooooo damn good looking . but i digress  nothing new here . bottom  line  hot girl group gets taken advantage of  some one gets hooked on drugs  someone gets hooked on a guy  some one gets the hell out  and then the horrible stuff happens . surprise  surprise . welcome to the music business . i can  t believe so many people out there think this is a good movie . so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies . i don  t play that  if you want to support these films by going to see them  great  if you enjoyed it  super  to each his own . but don  t try to tell me it was good . pleeeease  i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors . wanna see a good african  american movie  see love jones . ray . or the color purple . those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin . why  because they told compelling stories with great acting  that made you feel something long after you left the theater . just because it  s our experience does not automatically make it a good film . it  s only good   when it  s good . period .  
1,i saw this at  dances with films   and it was awesome . i really felt for jake . talk about adding insult to injury  not only are your parents getting divorced  but there  s a monster after you .  br    br   it was both heartfelt and scary   there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright . it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film  except that the story was actually good .  br    br   and that  s what separated  jake  s closet  from the usual indy film pabulum   an excellent script with compelling characters . also  by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama  the movie gets the best out of both genres  and avoids the clichs of both .  br    br   if it  s not coming out in theaters  definitely get the dvd .  
0,this film is another of director tim burton  s attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his vision  to the screen . he has done it with batman   sleepy hollow  and now this . this is not a remake . the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak  and charleton heston makes a cameo  . burton has reconstituted the entire story  watering it down for today  s mass viewership .  br    br   the original planet of the apes was a product of its time . during the      s america was struggling to redefine its civilization . it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . in that context  pota was allegorical  reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . the dialectic between colonel taylor  charleton heston   dr . cornelius  roddy mcdowall  and dr . zira  kim hunter  was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious .  br    br   burton  s version is as much a product of today  s times as pota was of the sixties . this is apes for dummies . it is superficial and jejune  substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . the surprise  ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene  burton  s ending simply mocks the audience  taunting  i know something you don  t know  and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out .   br    br   from a technical perspective  as is always the case with burton  s film  the film is excellent . the makeup is fantastic and burton  s camerawork is outstanding  though i continue to dislike his dark look  . however  thirty  three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script .  br    br   the story has been reduced to a monster movie . the humans band together behind captain davidson  mark wahlberg  to fight the monstrous apes  aided and abetted by a few turncoats  notably helena bonham carter as ari  . the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence  perfect for today  s fast food mentality .  br    br   the acting is mixed . mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . walberg is excellent at playing dark  sullen characters that are tormented but strong . this part requires an inspirational hero  a profile not in wahlberg  s repertoire . helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character  but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager .  br    br   then there is tim roth . his is a virtuoso performance  single  handedly saving the film from total ruin . roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade . he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time . additionally  his physical acting is superlative  rendering a chimp  man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists .  br    br   this film is a great disappointment . it is decent entertainment  as long as you check your brain at the door . i rated it a     . from a technical perspective it is much better than that  perhaps a     . however the story is an insult to the original franchise . it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation  using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . of course it  s true  but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films  instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .  
1,then you must see this film  to understand the reality . having read the book  ms . duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder formerly labeled manic  depression .  br    br   it is hard to believe that in this day and age  people still critique others with emotional problems  or those who seek psychiatric help . regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists  and this is unfortunate .  br    br   in this film  the audience sees the pain and suffering ms . duke had been through  especially as a child . many of us may remember her from the teenage  patty duke show  . she was a household name in america by age   .  br    br   you learn of her exploitation by the ross   well played by howard hesseman  . as she was growing up in the      s  the stigma was in full  force . however  we see as she advances in her career  yet the illness becomes worse . she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity even marries someone whom she divorces the next week and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother . all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy  and medication .  br    br   a recent survey released by nami  national alliance on mental illness  recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder . it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to .  bp magazine  winter      if you watch this film  you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not  pull herself up by her bootstraps  and  get well  until she was educated about her disorder  and received proper treatment . thank you  ms . duke  for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice .  
0,it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience  to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . however  this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan  who became annoying as hell in her own right  . her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . this film might have been more  as there was suitable budget for settings  actors and a decent story line . my wife and i both agreed that this was  muck  at the end  as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high  better luck next time  hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell .  
0,as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser  i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released . sadly it was a huge disappointment then  so i left it alone for   years before going back to watch it again  but it was no better the second time . mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer  but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester . the penchant for slapstick spoilt  the three musketeers  for me and the same applies here . to me  the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong . the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts  but they are adventure novels . there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has  after all  he is involved in dangerous situations . this is conveyed in the novels  but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style . it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book . when i first read that the book was to be filmed  the article said that the film was to star oliver reed . i rejoiced  as reed to me was the epitome of flashman . how i would have loved to see him in the role . malcolm mcdowell is a good actor  but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books  too scrawny looking  flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow  . neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck . what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy . the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet  tom bell  . a great shame  as the production values  costumes  sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent  just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell . possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is  as a recent radio adaptation of  flash for freedom   adapted by mr fraser  worked quite well . perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen .  
1,the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published . nolte takes the role of howard w . campbell  jr .  and makes it his own  remaining true to vonnegut  s depiction of a man who has lost all  to and  for love .  br    br   no weaknesses in this fine adaptation .  
0,this is one seriously disturbed movie . even though the boys deserved some of what they got . . . . . the sadistic gruesome executions were  slightly  over the top . the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot .  br    br   at the beginning of the movie  there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair  but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security  before the joy of what was to come .  br    br   the only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled   and  where is the batman   . kim basinger could have screamed .  br    br   now that would have been cool   
1,i  m sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly . i once saw a documentary about the man  but that  s the only time i once saw or heard anything about him . and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face . no  one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject .  br    br   the movie tells the story of ned kelly  s life . the irish immigrant has lived in north  west victoria all his life  but has never been very welcome by the authorities . the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family . when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes  he forms a gang with his brother and two other men . they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for  days . all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen  they are outlawed . finally they take over a pub in glenrowan  where they have a party with all the visitors  waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up . but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen . . .  br    br   it  s very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false . i guess nobody really knows  because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero  some kind of robin hood  the others will say he was an ordinary criminal  a murderer and a thief . i really couldn  t tell you which of them is right  perhaps both are  but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same .  br    br   this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors . heath ledger  orlando bloom  naomi watts  geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known  but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like . i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a  .      
0,i  ve tried to watch this so  called comedy  but it  s very hard to bear . this is a bad  narrow  minded  clich  ridden movie . definitively not funny  but very much boring and annoying  indeed . bad script  bad acting . it  s a complete waste of time  and there remains nothing more to say  i  m afraid .  br    br    out of   points .  
0,notorious for more than a quarter century  and often banned   it  s obscurity was its greatest asset it seems . hey  it  s often better to be talked about  rather than actually seen when you can  t back the  legend  up with substance .  br    br   the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently  and is available on home video  so that veil is slowly being lifted . while there is still plenty to offend the masses  it is more likely to bore them  than arouse much real passion . except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses   nature documentary  anyone    there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama .  br    br   once the sex and nudity begins  it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation  a looooooooong flashback to an alleged  beauty and the beast  encounter  and a naked woman running around the mansion  nobody  even her supposedly protective aunt  seems to even think of putting some clothes on her   . on video  i guess you can fast  forward thru the banality  but it  s not really worth the effort . the nudity doesn  t go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertolucci  s the dreamers .  br    br   try as one might to find some  moral  or  symbolism  in the carnality  i doubt it  s worthy of anyone  s effort . unfortunately  for la bete  now that you can more easily see the film  the notoriety of something once  forbidden  has been lifted . and this beast has been tamed .  
0,this show is terrible  the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse . i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two  all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them . well at least corner gas was good at first  little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode  . who are the people who are watching this show anyway  i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies  maybe the jokes are for them and they work there  i don  t know a single person who likes this show and can  t stand it myself  the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas . hopefully it won  t last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could  should have led to a great show .  
0,let  s see where to begin . . . bad acting i  m not sure if i  d even call it that  as it more along the lines of a no  effort script read . the actors didn  t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless . sure there was a scene or two with nudity  but that couldn  t save this movie from it  s lifeless characters .  br    br   to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do . the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants .  br    br   budget  did this movie even have a budget  it seemed like they used less money than i  ve seen in a home  shot youtube video . bad lighting  props  poor sound post production . bad special effects  if you want to go so far as to call them that . story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so  but there was no life to this flick i don  t care who directed it .  br    br   i  ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom . don  t waste your time or you  ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review . check the ratings  you  ll see the   s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed    s with hardly anything in between . wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time . what a suck  fest   
0,this movie was a major disappointment on direction  intellectual niveau  plot and in the way it dealt with its subject  painting . it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years  with appalling lack of depth though . it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner .  br    br   the approach to the subject of painting is very elite  limited to vague and subjective terms as  beauty  . according to the makers of this movie   beauty  can be only experienced in bob  ross  style kitschy landscape paintings . good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic  like  primary school level  color theory and lots of sentiment . in parts the movie is offending  e . g . at a point it is stated  rather  celebrated by dancing on tables  that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting  their works by definition being worthless  bullshit   quote  .  br    br   i do not understand how the movie could get such high rating  then again  so far not many people rated it  and they chose for only very high or very low grades .  
0,you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies  well if you  ve always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest  then this movie is for you . it truly was like a porn without the sex . or if that analogy is not to your liking  imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench . this is the movie that you would make .  horrible acting  bad camera work  music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all  and more . for those who are masochists in the crowd  this is a premiere piece for your collection .  br    br   all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie  were people who  starred  in it .  br    br   their movie career is over before it started .  
1,the sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed tv series ever  so naturally my expectations were through the roof  and yet the show surpassed them . i love the mafia and crime genre in film and i enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds  but this is so much more .    hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia  action stories  but also to be a great family drama  a shocking character study  a laugh  out  loud comedy  a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil  and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one . david chase  s epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more  and cements hbo as the closest tv can get to cinematic perfection  paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away .  br    br   realism is present when it is needed  but chase  s decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for  dream episodes  and the like only adds more layers to the series . chase   along with a strong writing staff including matthew weiner and terrence winter  future creators of mad men and boardwalk empire respectively   turns new jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters i  ve seen on tv .  br    br   james gandolfini domineers the show as tony  one of the most groundbreaking characters on tv ever . tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture  but he defies the other half entirely  and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with dr . melfi  lorraine bracco  with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show   we see nearly every side to tony soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect .  br    br   edie falco matches the power of gandolfini  s performance as tony  s wife carmela . from her mixed feelings about tony  s lifestyle  to her suspicions about murders  to her torment over tony  s cheating  to her own thoughts about infidelity  carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout  seasons and falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non  mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world . scenes between tony and carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television .  br    br   the supporting cast is almost as phenomenal  and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons  somehow without any redundancies . nancy marchand steals the show as tony  s overbearing mother livia  an insight into tony  s personality problems and panic attacks . the familiarity of marchand  s incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far . michael imperioli is christopher  tony  s protg  whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed . drea de matteo plays christopher  s girlfriend adriana  and is so well  meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with christopher  s career . tony sirico is paulie  introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic  but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show  and nobody plays true anger better than he . and that  s just the tip of the iceberg .  br    br   familiar faces such as peter bogdanovich  jon favreau  ben kingsley  lauren bacall  will arnett  nancy sinatra  david strathairn  robert patrick  hal holbrook  burt young  and eric mangini make appearances over the course of the show  while names as notable as joe pantoliano  steve buscemi  and steven van zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series . there are    great characters with powerful arcs  and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show .  br    br   comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series  which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough  the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered . the sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series i have seen overall  and its highs are so mindblowing that i would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows  most of which i disagree with  .  br    br   whether you love or hate the ending  or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself . the iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history . there are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show  so if you  re thinking of watching something else instead  do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit .  
0,i expected a bad movie  and got a bad movie . but i couldn  t really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was . i don  t even want to try to explain what blood surf is about . is not about blood surfing  but a big a crocodile . they are complaining about the fake shark in jaws  but spielberg was wise and didn  t show the shark until the end . here the crocodile is shown a lot of times  and it  s the worst fake crocodile i have ever seen  and they don  t try to hide it . if you want to see a good fake crocodile watch lake placid .  br    br   the director had an opportunity to make a decent surf  shark movie  but he had to make a bad b  monster movie . he had the chance to make an original surf movie  but he wanted to make a monster movie . so you have understand how bad this movie is  does it have some good parts  not really  it got some nudity  and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie . the acting isn  t half bad either  and kate fischer looks good . too bad she doesn  t take her top off . the lead actors aren  t bad either . they had some potential . the location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes . the blame is on the untalented writer and director . the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever seen  and the script is really badly written  and the director got no talent what so ever  and not much of a fantasy either .  br    br   don  t watch it . even if you want to watch the beautiful kate fischer . it isn  t worth it . watch sirens to watch kate nude  and watch lake placid if you want some good crocodile action .  br    br       because i  m in a good mood  and maureen larrazabal looks good naked  and kate looks good  but is bad actress   and dex miller  joel west and matt borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sht they had to work with .  
1,from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie . the poster is possibly the funniest i  ve ever seen for a movie . i immediately bought one for my dorm this september .  br    br   every element came together in this movie so beautifully . it  s not often you see a movie with so many penis  gay  and racial jokes so praised by critics . carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally . carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you  re rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid . the supporting cast is brutal  each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves .  br    br   one of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we  re given . this is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly . this movie will often be brought up when the words  chest waxing  and  condoms  are mentioned in conversation .  br    br   watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it . i saw a group of four mid    s women come in . despite an older audience  this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter .  br    br   i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell . a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you  d see on family guy  too . the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women .  br    br   i don  t recommend going to this movie if you aren  t a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended . however  when you are at the movie  just remember this movie is all in good humor . the jokes aren  t  gay jokes   they  re just jokes . and they  re funny .  
1,there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise . let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon . that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed . robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work . every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best .  
0, . . . so i thought i  d throw in a few words about william mcnamara . not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty  whities   it  s obvious he pumped up for this role and he looks pretty darn good in them   or less . there  s an extended sequence in a cave where he has to strip down to his undies . there  s a nice bit where he has to chase after miss eleniak in the buff  with only his hands cupped over his groin . william mcnamara is naturally a little on the skinny side  but he has a nice  generous handful of a booty . also  there  s a moment when he  s getting out of bed that if you pause the action at just the right moment you can see the whole enchilada . if you  re inclined to do so  and come on  half of the people who choose to watch a movie about navy men on a  road trip  are . i  d just like thank dennis hopper for his equal opportunity gratuitous nudity . can william mcnamara act  heck if i know .  
1,when i first saw this film on cable  it instantly became one of my favorite movies . i  m a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall . the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes . most of the attitudes came from soll  an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . soll is what makes the move  his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then . i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer  s disease . none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . while he has racist views  he  s grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . the two convicts he trusts most are jackson  mel winkler  and ben  james earl jones  . the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie  they have real chemistry . james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass .  br    br   this movie should have gotten more notoriety . however it  s on dvd and worth the money .  br    br   rayvyn  
0, . . . from this awful movie  there are so many things wrong with this film  acting  writing  direction  editing  etc . that it  s amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst . the music  i noted that the film has two composers listed . this must be the reason why every single frame has music  of the absolute worst  d  movie style drivel . they have never heard of the expression  less is more  . it got so painful to listen to  i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue  not that the dialogue was that good . you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley  i  m sure they didn  t see roles like this in the twilight of their careers . see it at your own risk .  
0,this is not horror  as the first part was this is   campy   light and humorous entertainment . like in so many sequels  the action starts right away with no explanations . but there  s boobs  so i don  t complain . and real boobs that is . if i understand correctly  those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u . s . of a . which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela  bruce  s sister  springsteen .  br    br   this cannot be thought without the first movie  so i compare this to it . again there is too small clothing  mainly pants  and funny hair  it  s not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . again there is really strange characters  this time even more visibly  pathological  ones . especially the personnel of the camp . it  s like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . people are older most of the actors must be at least    but i think they  re supposed to be   or something . some  methods  used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant . actually this movie don  t have much in common with the first part  and this is worse than it in every way .  
1,the violent and rebel twenty  five years old sailor antwone fisher  derek luke  is sent to three sessions for evaluation with the navy psychiatrist dr . jerome davenport  denzel washington   after another outburst and aggression against a superior ranked navy man . reluctant in the beginning of the treatment  he gets confidence in dr . davenport and discloses his childhood  revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house . meanwhile  he meets cheryl smolley  joy briant   and they fall in love for each other . resolving his personal problems  antwone becomes a new man . this true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life . the direction of denzel washington is excellent  making sensitive  attractive and with good taste  a story about child abuse . in the hands of another director  it might be a very heavy story . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil    voltando a viver    returning to live    
0,way back in      a certain director had no idea about a galaxy  far away or near . he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc . this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george . i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it . this is merely an advertising promo for the director  actors  et . al . it has little intrinsic artistic value . it is a brochure . the lead playing george  is very fine  as is the leia character  and the ersatz darth character . all else is plain commercial dross . what a waste . still  it got the job done i guess . the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess . a brochure only .  
0,this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store . don  t make the same mistake i did . this movie is tedious  unconvincingly acted  and generally boring . the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared . dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him . and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico  it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo  irish accents . odd . anyway  when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store  keep walking .  
1,  moonstruck  is one of the best films ever . i own that film on dvd  the movie deals with a new york widow  cher  who falls in love with her boyfriend  s  danny aiello  angry brother  nicholas cage  who works at a bakery . i  m glad cher won an oscar for that movie . nicholas cage and danny aiello are great  too . the direction from norman jewison  who directed  fiddler on the roof   is fantastic .  moonstruck  is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh . a must  see   br    br        stars   
1,linking story another first  time viewing for me and  again  this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies  and it  s easy to see why  though i realize how the film  s rather meaningless title could be misleading for some i certainly fancied director peter duffell  s choice  death and the maiden  which  incidentally  is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode   a great deal more . though the linking device itself is not all that great  the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable . production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with . the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and  frankly  it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre  though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him  .  br    br   now to the individual stories themselves  br    br    method for murder   the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but  to make up for this  it  s quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times  tom adams   fictitious  villain looking like the long  lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house         also  it ends with a satisfactory diabolique  type twist  and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead . that  s all we need out of it  really .  br    br    waxworks   for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent  as well as impeccably dressed  in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time  and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand  and ackland  s inexplicable inability  or unwillingness  to leave town somewhat recalls the house  trapped aristocrats of bunuel  s the exterminating angel       .  br    br    sweets to the sweet   this is perhaps the finest episode of all  with his ambiguous role here  christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks  who appears as lee  s daughter  . the film  s treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature  culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling  curtain  . trivia note chloe franks appears as a grown  up in the featurette included on the disc  and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn  t quite put my finger on it . later  on reading her filmography  it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long  running stage adaptation of agatha christie  s  the mousetrap  in london  s west end  which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of      needless to say  we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate  and delicious  portrayal in sheer evil  mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile    br    br    the cloak   a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale  that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre  while inventing some new ones   which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and  at one point  christopher lee himself   jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings geoffrey bayldon  made up to look like ernest thesiger  also has a memorably quirky bit the  silent  cinema  style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience  i suppose  and  while some of the humor comes off as heavy  handed a  la the fearless vampire killers       or theatre of blood        it  s also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high  and highly unusual  note   br    br   video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory  considering i had no other version to compare it with the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one  s enjoyment of the film . as for the extras  beginning with the audio commentary frankly  this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production  whereas with some other films  you  re left rather expecting there to be more   and  as such  it  s an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed . the featurette  a  rated horror film  is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center  stage but this time backed up with valid  if all  too  brief  contributions from producer max j . rosenberg and stars chloe franks  ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon . we also get film notes  reviews  bios and a poster  stills gallery which  again  are wonderfully assembled  with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty  and a welcome one at that  .  
1,europa   or  as it is also known  zentropa   is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen . the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless . . . a true feast for the eyes . the picture was a contender for a      s golden palm in canners . the award went to barton fink  by coen brothers   a film stylistically very similar to zentropa . here  s an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself .  
0,this movie down  shifts from  th into  st without bothering with  rd or  nd  grinding gears all the way to the sappy  b  movie finish  line . the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie . that is worth seeing . the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast  you may miss it . definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad  to  mediocre confusion . there is no real conflict  and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints  especially the unbelievable character  al . i wonder if he  s got a job for me in cincinnati   
0,i watched this a few days ago  so details are getting hazy . the film is shot on hand  held cameras  and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally  since we hadn  t had many studio pictures made in this way . i can  t help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything  designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn  t had all the compromises that come with a big budget  and so was more  real  . however what we have here isn  t much more than a not  as  good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket  so anyone who has seen that  or any one of the other rip offs there of  will know what to expect .  br    br   the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters  with the weedy soft kids out of their depth  close harmony singing  ebonics spouting black dudes  world weary sergeants  bitter and twisted psychos etc etc . . . all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time . maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation  maybe it was laziness  or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience  all i know is it was annoying . one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees  where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation   although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it . this seems to be the main pivot of the plot  with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth  but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way . the other big bug i had was how all the characters  with the exception of the psychos and the real softies  would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence  faced with farrell  s ubiquitous stoicism  immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic .  br    br   i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads  which was strong and very convincing  tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters  this wasn  t too hard .  br    br   in my imagination  bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty  and for my money   episodes of that would be more fun to watch .  
0,another movie to suffer without an adventure to run  no enigma to solve . just an illness man  acting like an animal . no a good reason to take this journey . pitt and lewis are great actors magnificent michelle forbes but a weak david duchovny performance . . .  
1,as part of our late     s vocabulary  we well knew the ponderosa  little joe  hoss  ben cartwright  etc . on that great show  bonanza .   br    br   it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set . this was a real show depicting family values . there may have been a weekly crisis  but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together .  br    br   lorne greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family . his words depicted wisdom . we often were left to wonder that ben cartwright  a widower  must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died . he reared wonderful sons .  br    br   naturally  we all wondered why pernell roberts left the show . the show was a gold mine and roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed . his career never took off as he was associated as a cartwright son . he should have tried to get back into the series . he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out .  
1,i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video . i am a big nut for sci  fi action flicks though anyway .  br    br   without giving any of the story away  it is worth seeing if you like sci  fi without requiring much thought . the story is basic  and the plot is very good . worth your time to see   br    br   maybe they will make a sequel     br    br    out of    
0,dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti  christ is found by an archaeologist  of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn  t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body .  like fallen without the suspense  of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren  like steven seagal and jean  claude van damme  i try to watch his movies whenever they  re on tv . i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed . this movie is utterly terrible . with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . worst of all is lundgren  s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest    all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen  which was good  and end of days  which was bad but better than this  overall this movie is the worst movie i  ve seen from dolph lundgren . it literally has nothing to recommend it . it  s awful and it  s the lowest point in lundgren  s career . and i saw cover  up  the last warrior and masters of the universe .  br    br       out of    awful   
0,this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen . the acting was terrible  horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot  i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone . what a waste of time  first  as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into . all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie . the prank phone calls  halloween night  a psycho  and one knife  its absolutely ridiculous . i was not scared at all during the movie  which i thought horror movies were supposed to do . as for the making of the movie  its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary . i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of  scary movie  for example . at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie .  
1,neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple   a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment .  br    br   lemmon is neatnik felix ungar  bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison  matthau  with somewhat disastrous results . seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other  s ways  with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite .  br    br   funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date . the priceless interaction between lemmon  matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches . the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters  a pair of geese  in disney  s the aristocats  and here   their comic timing on top of lemmon  s sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity   where it remains much of the time .  br    br   if you  re a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work  this one is not to be missed . matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast  even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began  and  of course  it  s easy to see why it became a top  rated tv show later on .  br    br   summing up top simon comedy  not to be missed .  
0,this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment . this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the    s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies . the most famous disasters in their ouvre are  subspecies    seedpeople  and  trancers  . none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid  actually . hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film . doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless . i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs . i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you  re a fan of him . for every good movie  it seems like he has made  inferior ones . anyways  the story is about the battle between  ancient sorcerers . one good one who  s here since    years to protect the humans  jeffrey as dr . mordrid  and one wicked one called kabal . he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot . combs gets his instructions from mentor . that  guy  only exists of a pair of eyes in space . very very cheesy  that is  every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that  s about the only form of special effects this movie has got . the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other  it  s over before you know it . . . i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little  but nooooooo . . . . in some scenes  you really can detect some originality and creativity  like for example jeffrey  s lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals  and if you really pay attention  you might even find some very small but nice aspects  like the raven which is called edgar allen  but overall  it  s a terrible waste of time and energy . i  m a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes . . . but he sure doesn  t have to put on a stupid maillot for that .  
1,this is a cute little horror spoof  comedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark  the most infamous horror hostess of all time . this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network . they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit  com never made it past the pilot stage due to it  s sexual references . this film however  is very amusing . elvira is the modern  day chesty morgan and the queen of the one  liners . this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal  elvira  s haunted hills  which was meant to be a take  off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it  s face . watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience   
1,high energy raoul walsh classic from      the bowery places saloon owner and operator wallace beery against bitter rival and dandy  george raft  with adopted street kid jackie cooper and good looking faye wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry . it  s not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about  but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids . plenty of wisecracks at the beginning  but the characters soften up as the film progresses . apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in beery  s saloon . the various characters  sexy chorus line  lots of drinking  a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so  called pre  code restrictions  and then later come the carrie nations led by carrie nation herself . it all creates a very vivid picture of a life that  s long gone . i don  t like to compare eras  but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today . the film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see .  
0,  people i know  is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about   despite the game efforts of a talented cast .  br    br   pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman  a past  his  prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . but unlike michael corleone  it  s impossible to have an emotional investment in this character  his dilemma  or his fate .  br    br   the film traces eli  s preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause  while distracted by a client  s  ryan o  neal  good in an underwritten part  latest  dirty laundry    in this case  a tv actress companion who  s gotten involved with the wrong people . tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role  although again  the script doesn  t give her much to work with . as eli  s sister  in  law  kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics .  br    br   this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff  and enjoy the other principals . unfortunately  between the script and direction   people i know  is strictly amateurish . hence its limited theatrical release  and speedy journey to dvd . consider yourself warned .  
1,eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand  up concert film i have ever seen . most stand  up acts usually have lulls at some point  but not this one folks . for   min there is not one moment that is not side  splittingly funny . from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead  on impression of mr . t  the laughs are non  stop .  br    br   sadly  this was done in      and eddie hasn  t done anything nearly as funny . it  s unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show  wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all .  br    br   eddie  if you  re out there  please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious . believe me your fans will love you for it . and i think you know that .  
0,i understand what this movie was trying to portray . how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother  which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty .  br    br   i do not have a problem with this message  but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch . i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self  consciously arty  as in this case  the result is often frustrating . including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take  minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience .  br    br   the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together . this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its  merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else . it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies  for example  notting hill   but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching .  
0,normally i would never rent a movie like this  because you know it  s going to be bad just by looking at the box . i rented seven movies at the same time  including nightmare on elm street    and wes craven  s new nightmare . unfortunately  when i got home i found out the videostore  guy gave me the wrong tape . in the box of wes craven  s new nightmare i found this lame movie .  br    br   this movie is incredibly boring  the acting is bad and the plot doesn  t make any sense . it  s hard to write a good review  because i have no idea what the movie was really about . at the end of the movie you have more questions then answers .  br    br   on  max power  s scale of  to    i rate this movie   br    br   ps i would like to correct corinthian  s review  right below mine  . he says robert englund is ripping off lingerie  riding horses naked  etc . the guy that did those things was mahmoud  played by juliano mer  not by robert englund .  
0,fred olen ray is a lousy director  even as far as b movie directors go  but  haunting fear  is probably one of his better films . yes  it does butcher the great poe story  premature burial  and yes  it is badly paced and uneven throughout  but it is also pretty entertaining . scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty  fragile housewife whose worthless husband  jay richardson  is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster  played by robert quarry  . delia sheppard  a veteran of many early   s soft  core movies  actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress . you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic  robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes . the ending didn  t make much sense   
1,the night listener held my attention  with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a   year old boy  rory culkin  who is very ill . williams has never met the boy in person  as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone . however  williams  ex  boyfriend  nice job from bobby cannavale  raises doubt about the boy  which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person . what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect . i will leave it at that . toni collette also stars .  br    br   i enjoyed this film  with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin  s adoptive mother . sandra oh also starred as williams  friend . the night listener is inspired by actual events  and it has a somber  almost creepy silence throughout . at times it is predictable  no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic  but i liked it anyway . i enjoy williams in roles like this  more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me . recommended .      
1,dolph lundgren is back  detention marks dolphs first film in nearly  years  and that is following the delayed hidden agenda . this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips  agent red and stormcatcher . however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda  which was better in almost every respect . what this film does have in it  s favour from dolph  s previous outing  is a sense of cheesy fun . the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role  and it  s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again .  br    br   the films story is ludicrous and prime b  movie material . an ex  military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching  whilst taking a detention class  he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal . the film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches . if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy . thankfully the filmmakers don  t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability  this film has a so bad it  s enjoyable kind of vibe .  br    br   where the film is let down is miss  using a fairly decent budget . the budget of around   million has not been well spent . it  s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination . the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse . there are some good moments . you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning  with plenty of destruction . the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen .  br    br   as for the cast . hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages . there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film . this however has problems . the actors are on the most part bad . the bad guys are terrible  but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness . the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters . they all hate authority  each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons  but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability . this movie is all about dolph though . while this film is nowhere near his best  it is nowhere near his worst . it also marks a turning point in his career . he is now back in good shape  and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action . dolph looks enthusiastic here  he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man  running from explosions in slow  mo  one liners  and handling large weapons  again in a movie like his older ones  albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one . it is good to see dolph looking energised . his films of the last  or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary  and using doubles a lot  he still does all the fights himself though  but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it .  br    br   overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode . there  s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm .   
1,this is the first of a two part back  story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man  s fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics  extensive religious and historical imagery  subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future . it isn  t perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and cautionary tale .  br    br   this first part sets the scene  human societies have developed advanced and capable robots  mostly humanoid  to serve people doing menial  unskilled jobs  labour  construction etc . and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them . one robot  however  rebels and kills his owner  stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die . he is destroyed but when the robot masses  destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest  with many human sympathisers alongside them .  br    br   the imagery here is exploitative  recounting race riots and abuse  tiananmen square  the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girl  s guise getting harried  hammered in the head and then shot dead as it pleads  i  m real  . it lays on the ground  clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out . it  s an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individuals .  br    br   anyway  this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film i robot  but it soon develops into a recognisable matrix back  story as the surviving robot contingent is exiled and congregates in the middle east  in the cradle of civilisation as the narrator informs us . there  the machines regroup and begin to produce new ai and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations . we see a commercial for a car that uses the circular energy hover engines that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around zero one  the name of their city . their goods and trade make their economy soar affecting other economies detrimentally and human governments and authorities establish a blockade in response . the machines send ambassadors in the form of adam and eve resemblances to a un congress to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the blockade  but they are forcibly removed and the scene is set for war in the second part .  br    br   the animation is by studio  c who work on quite a few of the animatrix and it  s evocative and visually stimulating  rendering different scenes like imagery montages  cctv footage and particular scenes of import distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly . the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep mentalities and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the tantalising mystery offered by the first film and morpheus  vague brief info  dumps this is a nice exposition of the cataclysmic events that left the world ravaged and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition  the development of ai and the importance of harmony and co  operation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice  themes expanded on in the movies .  
0,  how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes  did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth  in different time frames  attilla the hun wasn  t a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures  nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders  speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english  except for the inflections they  do not  use   which has been influenced by latin  ancient greek  danish and french   br    br    cultural differences can  t be overcome so easily  trust has to be won  yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders . of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods . the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like .  br    br    historical background none . visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture  but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part . a small  town theater group probably has better props .  br    br    boring  another lame canuck production  which inexplicably ran for ten long years . as a kids show it could make the grade  but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn  t bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season   like i just did . i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci  fi show  otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes   
0,if you  re going to look after a child  make sure they don  t live anywhere near a graveyard . especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her  friends  . but  our long haired heroine  oblivious to all the signs  shacks up with her family the nortons  which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter . even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast  s tendency to talk even when their lips aren  t moving  and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths . but enough of that . . domestic animals are being sacrificed  old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won  t shut up during any scene  even the quiet ones . oh  and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on .  br    br   in fact  it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather  smelt what they  d signed up for and gone awol . yes  i know it  s hard to get into movies these days  but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you  d want . if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting . featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett  and another almost equally as bad by the charisma  free child actress rosalie cole  the next dakota fanning she ain  t  the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax .  br    br   this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed  while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood  a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on . but back up a minute . . earlier on they were in the car  and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it . so do they stay where they are safe  no of course not  they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere  so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she  s having a nervous breakdown .  br    br   finally  the film closes . it doesn  t end  it just goes to a grinding halt . the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood  as if nothing horrible had happened . but  my dear viewer  something horrible has happened . you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained  boring horror films you  re ever likely to see  and lost   minutes of your life you  ll never get back . just think . . years from now on your deathbed  what you  d trade an hour and   minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family . sadly  it  s already too late for me . don  t you make the same mistake        
1,i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable . it is a quiet  little film that doesn  t overwhelm you with special effects or  big  performances . it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina .  br    br   henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker  a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods . toker  s search for the baby  s parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life . david srathairn plays truman lester  a slimy conman with an ulterior motive . and david plays the bad guy to perfection .  br    br   there is much more to this film than first meets the eye . filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music  it is worth watching .  
1,i borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating  because i wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds . as a matter of fact  they didn  t  at least  so its seems . some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie  that  s it  this is what the majority of viewers think . however  the surprise comes at the end  and unfortunately then  when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie . i was also astonished when i saw that the brazilian  portuguese title of this movie means  voyage into death  . this is the spoiler .  br    br   that this movie is about a young girl who goes alone onto this boat  on reasons that are completely unclear   you understand only in the last  minutes . when you start the movie with the english title  haunted boat  in your head  you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the  ghosts  . but in reality  this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer  watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality  it is told from the perspective of the young girl . we see her not alone  but together with the four friends because she sees them . we do not see that she is alone . so  the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture  stream  but the main story  we have at least two parallel worlds the world in which the girl is and the world in which the  friends are . an intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat .  br    br   i cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie  the movie  makers  cheated  an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film  student elaborate with hastily  chosen  pseudo  actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers . how mistaken can one be  but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes  the end that follows gives another surprise . the girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat . when she has recovered from her shock  she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends . and there they are again  they wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore . she jumps into the water  arrives at the boat  and they are away . miraculously beautiful . it remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a rhetoromance writer when i awoke  i saw death standing at my bed . but i closed my eyes . when i opened them again  he was gone .  
1,a unique film . . . one of the best of all time . acting  script  quincy jones  score  cinematography  editing  etc .   just fantastic . as most viewers know  this movie is based on truman capote  s book about the famous murder of a kansas farm family  the clutters  by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery . i  ve never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film .  br    br   the actors are solid across the board  but the focus is on the killers  dick and perry  and the law enforcement team pursuing them . scott wilson  as dick hickock is amazing . cocky  twitchy  and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming  oily and plausible . robert blake as perry smith is extraordinary as well   lonely  and at once empathetic and cold  blooded . who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it  he does  and it  s brilliant  a key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime  and these two actors make it work beautifully . both had moments in their subsequent careers  but these performances are high water marks  and that stands for acting period .  br    br   the cops are wonderful too . leading the investigation is john forsythe  but the other three detectives are great as well . unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles  these are just genuine flatfeet  working the case with determination and competence . they seem so real . i  ve never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity and i  ve seen most of the crime classics going way back . really one of a kind in this respect .  br    br   partial spoiler coming  this movie  s unique in that you already know what  s happened  but i  m warning for the record  .  br    br   of course  the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations   the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks  mano a mano . this movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you  ll ever see on film . watch dick and perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel  unaware the cops have the goods on them . but the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions . this is some of the best acting you  ll ever see . think glengarry glen ross without the showboating .  br    br   to help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story  icb was filmed at the actual clutter house  and i  ve heard the clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel . it works . these seem like decent  simple folk . it makes the crime so palpable and sad .  br    br   i  ll stop here . it  s not a feel  good movie  but it is one of the best movies ever made  and so unique  it  s mandatory viewing for every film buff .  
0,this movie is outrageous . by outrageous  i mean awful . i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke . the acting got progressively worse as the  movie  advanced  and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached . when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem . that was not intelligent . truthfully  stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed . if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie  bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends .  
1,this has to be one of my favourite flicks  unlike the weak  elvira  s haunted hills  . . . anyway i love the way the movie is a goth  com  wizard of oz  story . . .  br    br   elvira is a goth dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch  elviras aunt morgana  . . . she inherits a  ruby  ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock  her uncle  . . . she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow . there is a show down with her uncle  the wicked witch of the west  where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him . in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas  dorothy  s home in kansas  .  br    br   there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie . . . she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters . elvira  youe must be aunt em  and you must be uncle remus . . . . there  s no place like home  there  s no place like home   bad uncle vinny  i  ll get you my pretty  and your little dog too    br    br   there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas .  br    br   but aside from this  the fact that one of the sequences she  ripped off  um . . . i mean was inspired by flashdance  is pure genius . . . and if you don  t roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her  very    s  las vegas show then you haven  t got a camp bone in your body . . . this movie is a cult  camp classic  
0,i saw this movie as a very young girl  i  m   now  and it scared me witless for years . i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to  obviously  the violence . my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie . i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it    i am currently reading the book  out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it  s a classic  and it is really a great story . however i don  t think that it should have been made into a cartoon . ever . well  maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way . gives me a little heart palpitation every time . yah i am a wuss but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids  read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content . not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there     
1,as a huge fan of the original  i avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago  but i just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise .  br    br   okay  if you are looking for a retread of the original  you  re in for a big disappointment  but if you are looking for something quite different  a bit edgy and political  then this is the film for you .  br    br   gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school  where he  s being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students . when the student insists on meeting up with gregory  a series of misadventures ensue that include torture  breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved .  br    br   if you are looking for something original  then i highly recommend this film . i only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is .  
0,koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter . in the early ninety  s he tried his hand on movies as well . but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all . it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football  wife a tv presenter and program  maker . i actually did see this in an  almost empty  theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters  clouseau . i so regret spending money on it . it looks cheap  it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way . some people think it  s so bad it  s funny . i am not one of them . i just found it an incredible waste of time and money .  
0,tyson  br    br   aspect ratio  .      br    br   sound format stereo  br    br   reverent  though scrupulously fair  account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson . given his conviction on a rape charge  the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain  but paints a warts  and  all portrait of his rise to fame  the pressures of success  and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad . constrained by time limits  the script gallops through a succession of relevant details  alighting briefly on significant events  culminating with tyson  s  temporary  downfall in     . novices will be enlightened by the chronology  while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel  s straight  arrow approach to the material . he portrays tyson  s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success . in fact  the script reserves most of its venom for tyson  s ex  wife robin givens  characterising her as an ungrateful gold  digger who took advantage of his naivety . production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character george c . scott plays tyson  s mentor cus d  amato through acres of gritted teeth and paul winfield was surely born to play don king   
0,this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget  no effort  no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store .  br    br   if you want to know what watching this movie is like  grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and  attacking  people . congratulations  you  ve just made  hood of the living dead   now see if a distribution company will buy it from you .  br    br   i have seen some low budget  shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort  but this has neither . avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies .

1,  a wrong  doer is often a man that has left something undone  not always he that has done something .    emperor marcus aurelius  br    br   the dvd release of  watch on the rhine  could not come at a better moment . it restores to us a major lillian hellman play stirringly adapted to the screen by dashiell hammett  hellman scholar bernard f . dick  s audio commentary affirms his authorship  . it presents a subtle performance by bette davis  who took a subdued secondary role long after she  d become the workhorse queen at the warner bros . lot . equally significantly  it reminds us that world war ii had a purpose .  br    br   sure  you say  like we needed that . we  ve heard cary grant sermonizing in  destination tokyo        about japanese boys and their bushido knives . we  ve watched jackboots stomp the living hills in  the sound of music        . we  ve toured an england callously occupied by germany in  it happened here        . yet  truth to tell  we still need the message spread .  br    br   i have an    year  old friend who curses franklin roosevelt regularly . he feels that fdr connived the u . s . into a foreign fight we didn  t need  and thereby caused the death of his favorite cousin . he  s encouraged in his demonizing of allied leaders and the trivializing of war two by patrick buchanan .  br    br   the political columnist has freshly released a fat book heavy with detailed research which claims that adolf hitler would have posed no further menace to poland  europe  or the world if only the third reich had been handed the free city of danzig in     . buchanan holds that if those selfish poles hadn  t confronted the nazis  drawing in foolishly meddling britain and giddily altruistic france  no war would have engulfed the west . he believes that without the rigors of total war  no one in germany would have built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the jewish problem .  br    br   some commenters on this site feel that  watch  sags under the weight of stale propaganda . maybe . however  neither my friend nor pat buchanan seem to have gotten the film  s point some people hurt and kill to grab other people  s land  goods  and liberty such people dominated the axis powers and  enough  didn  t appear in their vocabulary .  br    br   paul lukas deserved the oscar he won . he and bette davis put convincing passion into their portrayals of refugees who fight oppressors . they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines  for actively facing down torturers and murderers . bernard dick notes that hellman didn  t care for lukas as a person since he stayed apolitical . of course  as a hungarian he had seen first  hand bela kun  s bloody  dictatorship of the proletariat  replace an outmoded empire and then topple to admiral horthy  s right  wing tyranny .  br    br   in a marvelous cameo role added to the play by hammett  henry daniell sardonically depicts a wehrmacht officer of the class that disdains the brown shirts he serves . his phili von ramme would doubtless stand with field marshal rommel in     during the plot of july   th against hitler . in april      however  he pragmatically abets the nazi cause  although he insults herr blecher  the butcher  and scorns the rumanian aristocrat teck de brancovis for trying to peddle information on an underground leader .  br    br   teck  a pauper and possible cuckold  wishes cash and a visa to return to europe where he can resume the shreds of a life that had come undone with the empire  shattering great war and the greater world  wide economic depression . he has no political convictions  no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow . mercury theater graduate george coulouris lends this burnt  out case  s old world cynicism an edge of desperate menace .  br    br   lucille watson gives winsome vitality to the grasping man  s hostess  a domineering old gal who knows her mind and gets her way   but who doesn  t adequately appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home she controls . she and her pallid office  bound son belong to the american version of von ramme  s and de brancovis  privileged kind . however  this family hasn  t seen ruin and never will . they  re moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it .  br    br   this mother and son might easily make choices which would reflect that complaisance toward national socialism and fascism which flourishes today in my friend and in pundit buchanan .  watch on the rhine  has a manicured period look . its dialogue reflects its erudite origins on the stage rather than sounding fresh from the streets . yet hellman and hammett  s film has gut  based power . audiences still need to hear and heed its call to arms against grabbers relentlessly on the march .  
0,there  s one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans . everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick . the female characters are typical horror movies females . they are wooden  annoying and dumb . you are glad when they are killed off . long live the strong female character in a horror movie

0, . . . and it is this film . i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife  damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity .  br    br   okay  maybe it  s not that bad  but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to  manos  the hands of fate  . . . and i have seen a lot of bad movies  believe you me .  br    br   this is just a crummy b movie  bad film  making at it  s finest  or is it worst   the thing i really didn  t like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief . now  a little comedy relief is a good thing  but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons  rather than on the  heroes  of this film  who are actually in it for less time than them   br    br   to be fair  crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing . but honestly  this was probably a bad film to begin with  so crown really couldn  t have done that much to hurt it .  br    br   this really needs to be in the bottom    list . i wouldn  t wish this one on my worst enemy .  br    br   actually  it  s my kind of campy b movie . it was bad  but i still liked it  despite my one star rating .  
1,i am surprised at imdb  s low rating of this movie . with all due respect  its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor . they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills  a bigger budget  and more gore .  br    br   the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . it is not  nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one . it is a psychological thriller . it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . reel . com  s review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie . all the other negative reviews doesn  t make much sense . it  s almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change  very rare these days  is something bad and not worth it .  br    br   i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn  t make sense . martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning . the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing  we sympathize with this cold  blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film  s direction and writing .  br    br   i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the   s range on originality alone . i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale  aka smart people  since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy  s nightmare .  br    br   kudos to the acting as well . for such a low budget film  you are amazed that this movie didn  t hit your local cinema with the great direction  writing  and acting . please don  t be fooled by the rating by imdb . this movie is worth it . i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .  
1,de grot is a very good film . the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb  who also adapted this story for the screen . some really top  class acting  not only by van hut  but especially by marcel hensema  who mostly did tv  work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf . the film seems to kick of as a thriller  and sets an excellent mood . then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf  and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash  back structure  which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character  driven drama of the movie . in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending  that will grab audiences by their throats . make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie . a must  see  especially if you liked  spoorloos   the vanishing  s original screen adaptation  .  
1,after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin  i bought it on dvd  hence the  spin  pun . . . i  m a dork  . the beginning was everything i hoped for  a perfect set  up  along with some quotes that i  ve heard on various wu  tang albums  to what should have been a good movie . but the plot i heard was so great  was so predictable . every time i saw a character  except for the lizard  i guessed which venom he was . plus  the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie . ok  so the plot wasn  t very good but at least there was some good kung  fu right  wrong . the fights were very short and few and far between . granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer . i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened . i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened . i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than  total minutes but it never happened . in short  not much happens . the fighting is all pretty routine . don  t be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot  it does not mean it  s a good one .  
1,say what you want about andy milligan  but if his family was even    as deranged as the one in this film  well then i guess he could have turned out worse . unfortunately  the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture  s box office appeal . several times during the film milligan  s ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends  and suddenly good  looking stand  ins for milligan  s homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic    s guitar rock . it  s pretty easy to fast  forward through if you  re trying to pay attention to milligan  s original film  which  unfortunately  is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes . what remains  however  is still compelling stuff . i don  t think i  ve ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before .  
1,this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early     s and it  s definitely on of the better ones to watch out there .  br    br   the movie got directed by the genre expert vincente minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead . both did quite a few movies together back in those days  of which this one is probably their best known one .  br    br   the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year  which meant it beat out movies such as  a place in the sun    a streetcar named desire    the african queen    quo vadis    the blue veil    death of a salesman  that year . a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful  bright and entertaining movie .  br    br   when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all  which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie . the musical numbers are also all nicely done  which is no big surprise when you have people such as vincente minnelli and gene kelly at work .  br    br   but really  couldn  t had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so  i mean  we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible . not that it makes the movie drag in any parts  it just makes it a bit overlong . the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it .  br    br   one of the better mgm musicals  that is not without its flaws though .  br    br        
0,how can this movie have a  .  this movie was a piece of skunk st . first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded . because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut  that happened to be about oh  quarter of an inch thick  that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood  and he did not even think he could cut threw it  second the person who did the set sucks as at supplying things for them to build with . the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t . v . show . bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of st they call a movie .  br    br   rating  .   
0,ok . for starters  taxi driver is amazing . this  this is not taxi driver or amazing . what it is is bad . but i thought it was bad funny  which means that it did have some redeeming qualities . like the dialogue . . . wow . there was more or less no plot  the characters were all stupid  and the movie was preachy . there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence  which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder . i can  t even believe that there are like   other people who have seen this movie . yeah  it  s worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie  or at least can try to .  
1,before she went into politics or public service  glenda jackson was one of britain  s finest film actresses . this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty  the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last   years  and jenny played by american ann  margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister . alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i . sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him . you see familiar faces like sheila keith  patsy byrne  and frank finlay . you can  t help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes . it  s not the greatest movie but it  s good to see glenda  s amazing talent . she is still a fantastic actress  comedy or drama . she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her .  
1,twelve years ago  production stopped on the slasher flick  hot blooded  since almost everyone on the set started dying . now  a couple of film students have decided to finish the film  despite the fact that there  s a rumor that the film is cursed . well  they  re about to find out that some curses are real .  br    br   when scream was released  every country seemed to want to cash in on its success  even australia . the concept  which today has been done to death  a slasher film within a slasher film  was at the time relatively cool and original . this movie was released right before urban legends final cut and scream   well not in the us but in australia  so it felt like the first movie with this concept . when urban legends  was released  most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn  t even good  the movie flopped disastrously . now  cut is not the best slasher flick ever  and nor does it try to be . it knows that it  s a rip  off  and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role . but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story  they  ve decided to rip  off some   s slasher flicks like  nightmare on elm street  as well and surprisingly enough  this actually works . the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer  and instead of trying to scare the audience to death  they  ve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn  t able to fully ignore  the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . spoiler ahead i mean  they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene  it makes no sense i tell you . end of spoilers . all in all  cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip  offs that never made it big . i  m surprised that this one never got a sequel  but i guess it simply came out too late .  br    br   suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares . cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it  s completely ludicrous .

his rather large task . patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe  s visit will entail  the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking  cleaning and maintenance for him . fanshawe is a fussy sort  very neat and precise with everything having its place  whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room . needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work  but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit  so he asks the squire for a replacement pair  the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters  is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house  so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages  there the squire directs him to points of interest  including gallows hill  where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours  his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin  but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn  t  he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants  fanshawe doesn  t have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched  he feels a presence  he begins to see moving shadows in the woods  startled he runs home . over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire  patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it . . the binoculars  they used to belong to a local man called baxter  whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill  boiling them up for some concoction or other  baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night  the late squire had acquired his belongings  including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area . these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars  but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches  never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power . that night he has horrifically vivid dreams  when he wakes  he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them  what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so  fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession  as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist  they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill  they quicken their speed  but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny  the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in     with the ice house  they were for the most part based on the work of the great m . r . james . in     and     the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james  whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers . director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films  but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story  his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax  all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum  thus upping the tension and mystery . the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere  the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come . the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles . the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective  the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see  may even have influenced lex de la iglesia in his film la habitacin del nio       of the following year  with which it bears striking similarity . i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film  but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers  something that doesn  t happen much these days  i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing  which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow . plenty of time is given  even within its brief   minutes running time  for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade .  
0,when i got this movie free from my job  along with three other similar movies . . i watched then with very low expectations . now this movie isn  t bad per se . you get what you pay for . it is a tale of love  betrayal  lies  sex  scandal  everything you want in a movie . definitely not a hollywood blockbuster  but for cheap thrills it is not that bad . i would probably never watch this movie again . in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time  or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time . despite the bad acting  clich lines  and sub par camera work . i didn  t have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player . the story has been done many times in many movies . this one is no different  no better  no worse .  br    br   just your average movie .  
0,this is the result . a piece of trash movie that doesn  t deserve to even be classified as a movie  it  s just a bunch of stuff on a film reel  that makes no sense whatsoever . well back to the actors  which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film . well it  s a great horror anyway  nevermind being a film . there  s plenty of horrific acting in  hobgoblins   but the worse is the main guy named richard  who is just way too much of a weakling to even sorta root for . well  when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary  on a less than shoestring budget  no less  this is what will happen . oh well at least the mst  k version was hilarious . but this is still a horrid movie  that deserves all the bashing it gets .  for the mst version .  
0,disjointed  unclear  bad screenplay  poor photography and direction . . . all in all very obviously an ill  conceived first effort at commercial film  making by the good people at tbn .  br    br   tbn pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring  china cry   the story of nora lam  to the big screen . but  the omega code  is an unfortunate miscue . as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved  china cry   i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . they do much good with their ministry  but this isn  t an example of it . don  t waste your money . . . go rent  china cry  instead .  
0,wonderful cast wasted on worthless script . ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles . could this ever happen in a million years  it  s simply a fantasy  and a boring one at that . do they become teenagers again  do they reenact their pranks  games  good times  they may try but ultimately the answer is no . is there any intrigue  any suspense  horror  comedy  none of the above . how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me . i wanted to like this movie i tried to like this movie  but my brain refused .  
1,what a fascinating film . even if it wasn  t based on real life  forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element . and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars .  br    br   the author of forbidden love  norma  was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name .  br    br   but the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing . what a patient woman  i loved this movie . i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon . the journey this film takes you on is clever  interesting and totally engrossing .  
1,this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time . recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old  grainy vhs versions .  br    br   i hadn  t seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time . it  s one of those rare  perfect storms of comedy where great writing  truly funny line after truly funny line  is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time .  br    br   dudley moore got an oscar nomination for  arthur  but lost  although john gielgud won for best supporting actor  . if moore  s performance in  arthur  doesn  t win a best actor oscar  it  s proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title  another example is gene wilder in  young frankenstein   .  br    br   steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm  hearted tone of the story . quite simply  imho the movie is a rare gem . it  s only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after  arthur  was released .  br    br   regarding the dvd that is available as of        it  s so  so . although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies  there is still no widescreen version available .  br    br   the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it  s just not enough . one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included  because they were hysterical   but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit . the dvd  being the perfect format to include such material  certainly should have offered it as well .  br    br   this  the original  arthur   is a classic comedy that is one for the books .  
1,everyday we can watch a great number of film  soap . . . on tv . sometimes a miracle happens . a great film  with real feelings  with great actors  with a great realisator  director . for me there are two films that everyone needs to see  the first is the pacula   sophie  s choice  with meryl streep . the second is  journey of hope  . as human beings  we need to learn about humility  about love of the others  about acceptation of other civilisation  other way of living . we also have to struggle against racism and fascim . we must avoid judging  criticize we only have to love our earth companion . this wonderful film  helps us reaching john  lennon  his dream  imagine all the people living live in peace . these two films are difficult to see  watch these  but sure you will be hurt  but better . great film  great actors  terrible story  pain and cry guarantee  but also better understanding of the others . enjoy it .  
1,i never saw this when i was a kid  so this was seen with fresh eyes . i had never heard of it and rented it for my  year old daughter . plus  the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious . the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre . but the story is great . my daughter was entranced . i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him . very amusing to see him dance  and if the songs weren  t great  at least they weren  t disney over  produced saccharine sweetness . the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her  and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end  but it was mostly benign . interestingly  we had recently read  puss in boots   and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story . but while staying true to almost every aspect  walken  s acting made it believable . great fun . i  d watch it again with my daughter .  
1,a film destined to be on late  night tv long after the present instant  money  makers  have long been forgotten . perhaps a little too subtle for today  s youngsters  but in time they  ll grow into an appreciation of this movie .  
1,lars von triers europa is an extremely good film . how  s that  von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story  at least he did have with europa . to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen . even with all the tricks  in my opinion  this film is the most complete  real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top    list . i also think it is perhaps the scariest  the most gothic and complete film around . all right there are other good ones too  but this one is my favorite . the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever .  
1,this is a wonderful film . the non  stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate . the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated . i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts . joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together . some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today  s movies . put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is .  
1,the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie . this is a great movie . there is no special agency involved in the plot . this is the clue  this is a private plot  built as a private enterprise . this is a self  destructive and a self organized plot . as a conclusion  the scenario described the perfect professional plot private  self organized  self  destructive  with no trace at the end . anyone can be behind the plot a smart  director  with some money . all can be done just by delegation . the  director  must be just trigger . if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie  a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered . all the actors  performances are well done  with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney .  
1,house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game .  br    br   have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong  watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . you  re never sure of who is exactly who in this movie .  br    br   this is both a quality and a drawback of the script . as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .  
1,exquisite comedy starring marian davies  with the affable william haines  . young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom . cameo performances showcase  all the stars in mgm  s heaven  in the famous commissary scene  plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar . pic also captures for posterity davies  famous  wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day  her swanson is a beaut   .  br    br    peggy   even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis  turns up her nose and comments   ohh  i don  t like her    br    br   my print was perfect . story  direction  acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados .  
1,ok  this movie is stupid . i mean that in a good way though . it was stupid on purpose  and was one of the better  stupid  movies i  ve seen . the jokes and gags are purposefully bad  but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me . the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre . there is a pretty weak plot  but it works just fine .  br    br   elvira  s character is the focus here . she is lovable and adorable . cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie . on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly  stunning . few men could disagree with that . the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie .  br    br   i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last .  br    br   highly recommended to fans of comedy  and to fans of beautiful women . i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies .  
1,this movie is amazing . the plot was just . . . wow .  br    br   i was very surprised by gackt  s and hyde  s performance  after growing up in the american world of the actors who can  t sing and singers who can  t act .  br    br   in this movie  a young sho  gackt  comes across a vampire  kei  hyde  . over time  they form an unlikely friendship . kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others  the half  life of a vampire .  br    br   it  s a sad movie  but not sappy . the plot was very unique  and contrary to your typical vampire flick . the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing .  br    br   the only fault i would say the movie had  despite it  s lack of a happy   albeit peacefulending  would be it  s multiple languages . i had the unsubdued version  i  m lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese   so i would recommend getting something with subtitles .  br    br   all in all  the movie was just awesome .  
1,i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton  s james bond and although it wasn  t his deserved   rd bond outing  it was a laugh . belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely  but was probably underused . his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men . the other brit in it was a bit shocking  but overal it was a laugh .  
0,i began watching this movie with low expectations  as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s . k . novel  a novel i never read  .  br    br   i  m glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn  t nothing close to good  but it manages to keep you interested . what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors . the movie is overlong  hasn  t no  nice  shots and no scares  the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap .  br    br   the only things good are that  as i said  it keeps you interested  i guess the book must be good  without using much horror cliches .  br    br   my vote     .  
1,first saw this movie in about      and absolutely died laughing through it . it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends  and we  d quote from it at the drop of a hat   i  m going home in a bag    . needless to say  the humor is still there    years later . it  s become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film  good thing you can still buy it off ebay   i  ve found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek . . and this movie provides it all  pathos  suspense  unrequited love  nobility and the list goes on . royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller . i remember seeing him in  the  faces of dr . lao  as a bad guy who met a bad end . here  you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning .  br    br   if you aren  t careful  you  ll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie . the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments  little subtle costume digs at other sci  fi movies  and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e . coyote   br    br   don  t spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie  people  this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking  and shouldn  t be offensive to anyone  well  maybe stupid people  but they won  t know they  re being mocked . .  .  br    br    now if you  ll excuse me  i  m gonna go get a  zag  nut  bar . . . .  br    br    ramsay  rc  cowlishaw  karaoke dj  entertainer  
1,a surprising rent at a local video store  i was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge oliver stone  s  natural born killers .  and almost as disturbing . i think it went well with my viewing to be in late     watching the republican machine do it  s magic on the majority of america  s television viewing populous . it brings up the question  are we really that manipulative    br    br   it definitely skewed my view . there was also a larger theological question being provoked  the story of christ . could word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitive as television produce a messiah  could the story of christ been exaggerated  could it have been completely fabricated  it  s something the movie puts in a extremely perceptive light .

0,even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it  s still an awful film . if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke . . . . . first off  jeroen krabb is i guess the poor man  s gerard depardieu . . . . . naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the  iron mask  three musketeer one . otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabb is worse than that . the poor man  s box office poison . . . . really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised . if the   th man  is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie . . . . what am i saying  it isn  t . let  s just say hypothetically  if it was supposed to be  it wasn  t sharp enough . satire is a tricky thing . . . . if it isn  t sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead . . . . . . i think that is what happened . the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either . . . . .  for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film . . . . very sharp satire   br    br   potential spoiler alert  br    br   really  the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabb  s character works so so hard to attain . . . . do you even care  is it funny  since mr . voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control . . . . . though i  m guessing he didn  t cast jeroen krabb because he  s the worst actor and every character he  s played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass . . . . except he  s incompetent at it . so it becomes like a weird caricature . do you think mr . voerhoven did that on purpose  and jeroen krabb is the butt of the joke as well  i just don  t see it . . . . . . so you understand the dilemma i  m faced with here right  it is the worst film ever because he  s supposed to be a good director . so there is some kind of dupery involved . i knew  patch adams  was horrible without even seeing it . do not be duped by  the  th man  s deceptively alluring packaging or mr . voerhoven  s reputation as a good director etc . etc .  
0,this is a film that makes you say  things . . .   i can do much better than this  acting  writing and directing    this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others . . .  br    br   looks as if it was shot with my flip video . i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . one of the worst  movies i have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials       
0,i  ll say this much   this director is all about raw images . . . things most of us are not ready to confront head  on . images of sex  suicide  murder  and people  relieving themselves  are constantly bombarding the viewer  which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release . although i don  t think that i could ever see this movie again  i will say that the director does have a good eye . there were some really nice shots and  picture moments  in the film  the fans  the wire fish in their hair   but the story left me needing more  strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves  what the heck did we just see    .  br    br   note if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily . . . don  t see this film .  
1,this anime seriously rocked my socks . when the anime first opened itself  i felt it was too slow the story wasn  t quite moving forward  and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead . once he learns more about tracing  and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself  the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together . it was fantastic .  br    br   additionally  i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop  in the real world . there wasn  t any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch  but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on . a few of the  surprise  people that show up  gilgamesh   seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another  meaning we didn  t have  generic bad  ass a  being replaced by  generic bad  ass b  as soon as a died .  br    br   anddd  i loved the music . the opening music rocked  and the finishing theme from the final episode just . . . seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more . good job  type  moon   
1,the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people . presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart . a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions . the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation . the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed . ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch . a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love . by far the most romantic  at least one of them  movie of all times .  
1,mardi gras made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but  are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another . david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to   dollars . when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded . when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions  americans seemed sad  hurt  and a little remorseful but didn  t really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth . when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads . the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn  t believe it . this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own .  br    br   m . pitts  
0,this is one of the very worst films clark gable made . only parnell was obviously worse . it is just so painfully clichd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making .  br    br   gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going  to the slammer  like the gangster talk   . she holds out hope that he  ll do the right thing but he just leaves her there   unknown to either of them  gosh  that she  s  in the family way  . eventually  the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending  they seemed to have forgotten about gable  s needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow . leonard maltin says  the stars are at their best here  . by what standard  best at producing unintended chuckles  gimme a break   br    br   ps   after saying this  my wife thinks leonard maltin is going to find me and kick my butt . hmmm . however  despite my comment  i think mr . maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet  i hope that appeased him  .  br    br   update         . because i disliked this film so much the first time  especially the ridiculous ending   i decided to watch it once again . after all  sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh . while that has been the case with several films in recent months  i still disliked this film   even the second time . most of it was not because of the first half of the film . in the first half  harlow  s character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable . but when she was sent to prison  it was all clichs until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred . the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb   it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons . i stand by my original review  despite all the  not helpfuls   and think that aside from parnell and possibly polly at the circus  it might just be the worst gable film .  
1,the number of times i  ve had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few . and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie . this movie has some kliches but i really don  t care . i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it . it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good  but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message . we all know it in our hearts  but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it  s forms . it  s only when we love that we  re truly alive . i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i  m not usually like that . i  m quite a cynic . this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see .  
1,a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying    s music . this epitomizes the    s desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work . personally i liked greensleeves and the other harsher characters . they had some of the more amusing lines .  
0,someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date . i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie . it  s just terrible . without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes  take my word for it  the sex scenes are uninteresting at best . jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film  she does look good  but it  s all downhill from there .  
0,oh my god  please  for the love of all that is holy  do not watch this movie  it it   minutes of my life i will never get back . sure  i could have stopped watching half way through . but i thought it might get better . it didn  t . anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual . no wonder us australians  new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies . everything about this movie is horrible  from the acting to the editing . i don  t even normally write reviews on here  but in this case i  ll make an exception . i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe  
0,born again is a sub  standard episode from season one . it deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn  t fly . i  ve never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode . it does reference the tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode . but the positives end there . which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode . i think it  s ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl . and he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge . there  s even a serious lack of witty mulder  scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat . if you  re into reincarnation  maybe this episode is up your alley . if you  re not  then at least you can learn what bradycardia is .  
1,house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels . it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller . it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay crouse and joe montegna  and a strong  strong cast of supporting players  and it introduces ricky jay  card sharp extraordinaire  prestidigitator and historian of magic . its dialogue  written by david mamet  is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie  in which reality is often in question  an extra dimension of unrealness .  br    br   on the face of it  house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men  diametrically different from the sting  which was played merely for glamour and yuks . at this level it does succeed admirably .  br    br   however  you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization . the only movie i know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin . that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus  hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs . house of games sticks to its business . as poe once said of a good short story  it drives relentlessly to its conclusion .  br    br   there is another strain of movies  about  women  epitomized by thelma and louise  a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed  whether or not they realize their inner strengths . what tripe .  br    br   as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater . it should be a natural for film festivals . nominate it for one near you if you get the chance .  br    br   i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my   year old daughter . better she should see it on a tv than not at all .  
1,when i was very young  on a local tv station  they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on saturdays . i saw lots of kung fu movies on weekends . i remember lots of them . i saw great flicks like crippled masters  blind fist of bruce  kung fu zombie  shaolin drunken monk  rage of the master  tattoe dragon  and . . . five deadly venoms . i remember the day clearly . me and my dad had just gotten lunch at burger king . we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday . we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch  turned on the set and flicked it onto   . the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it . then under that was the title of the film . it said five deadly venoms . then the movie began . i bit into my burger amused with the pre  credit sequence . i loved this movie the minute it came on . my favorite character was the toad venom . the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn  t what lured me . . . it was the fighting . the fights were so . . . amazing . i moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the  hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended .  
0,well  no  not really . its not really a good movie  but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be . i really didn  t feel ripped off of my rental money  and sometimes thats all you can ask for . the plot is ok  nothing brilliant or new  the acting is pretty bad  but the cast is pretty . the directing is passable  but the effects are horrible  especially the werewolf effects  which in a werewolf movie  is a pretty big problem . there was a fairly decent amount of nudity  which to me is a pretty good thing  but it wasn  t all that hot . all in all  its a fairly average direct to video movie  not the worst film i  ve ever seen and if you  re bored a genre fan  check it out sometime . i  d even watch it again .  br    br   bonus fact for horror geeks  kane hodder  jason vorhees in a few of them  plays the werewolf .  
0,this is a rotten movie . the cast seem to know just how bad it was . it starts badly and by the end is truly bad . the acting is woeful . the script could of been written on the spot . and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes . crap  out of    
0,i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently  and the sci  fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find . as such  i  m sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw sands of oblivion . the acting was uncharacteristically sub  par  as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci  fi usually has in store for us . there are a few cameos made by people you  d most likely recognize  although you may not know their names by heart . the cgi special effects are minimal  and as such  one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci  fi feature is lacking . sure  there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer  or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he  s known for a couple of days  but overall  it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter  and i consider that a major disappointment .  br    br   if i was rating it on a   star scale made specifically to judge made  for tv movies  i  d probably give it a   maybe even a  . a real shame that i may have to wait  till the next sci  fi original movie to get a good laugh  and i really hope that this movie isn  t part of some overall quality increase in sci  fi original movies .  
0,look  there  s nothing spectacularly offensive about this film  it  s just boring . it  s a typical rom  com with an ending you can see coming before you  ve seen so much as the trailer . the key difference is that the classic rom  coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension . this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement  you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment . the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago . i  d recommend re  watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation . oh  one other big problem . . . no chemistry . if you  re used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias  you  re going to be seriously disappointed with the way they  ve made him look here .  
1,i read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred  went ahead and started watching . i admit that i had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex  involved and full of detail . that is a good thing but also  quite unexpected in this culture of car chases  explosions  gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development . in fact  what a welcome departure  however  i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch .  br    br   this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school . it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer . what a nice change . i would compare it to  all the president  s men  in terms of generic subject matter . that is  it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially  own  them .  br    br   unlike  all the president  s men   this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality . in this sense the movie is a character study like  the negotiatior  with samuel jackson and kevin spacey . in that movie  their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense . yet  the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other  trust each  and ultimately unite together against the corrupt police department . there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically  there are many similarities .  br    br   i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration . in fact  i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals i  ve seen in my life going back to watergate . the thing is  the public knows that something is wrong  for sure  but following the details is hard to do . this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity . i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations .  br    br   if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience  it really is excellent  i watched it  times in a row  the acting is superb and the directing is flawless . the weakest link is john cusak  s accent .  
1,i thought it was an extremely clever film . i was very pleased with it and truly couldn  t  ask for more . i actually own the film because i didn  t return it to someone . . . which i should do  but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it . also  the fact i don  t own too many foreign films and this is a first . now  i personally love finnish stuff so  that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it . but overall  its worth watching . however  if you  re not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit  then this film is not for you .  br    br       for sure .  
1,excellent farce  which  of course  is all it is intended to be . thankfully there is neither a social or political message  nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction . could the plot actually take  or have taken place in any particular time or location  unlikely  for  after all  this is simply  merely  a movie  and movies spring from imagination  not from reality . the only goal of this movie is to entertain  certainly not to educate  and entertain it does  with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds . i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity . but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a  no  brainer   which the mating game is in all respects . for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then  this is fine fare fantasy .  
1,in      director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster  and that he did   with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast . the result was scarface   starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles . the story begins in may of      when castro opened the harbor at mariel  cuba  to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states .        left cuba at that time  for the greener pastures of freedom in america  and most were honest  hard  working people  thankful for the opportunity they had been granted . but not all . among the marielitos  who streamed into florida  approximately       had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba  s jails   criminals considered beyond redemption  who castro had merely wanted to be rid of . and they  too  saw america as a land of opportunity  even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier . and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana  pacino   known to his associates as caracortada .  scarface .  br    br   now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up  montana wanted what he felt was coming to him  and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida  he was determined to have it all . wealth and power   that was montana  s dream  and he would get it by doing what he did best  beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez  robert loggia  . lopez  it seems  had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro  s goons  a man who  having outlived his usefulness to castro  had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana   along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats  where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives . and in short order  montana sees to it that lopez  s brother has been avenged  and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america .  br    br   lopez  a wealthy businessman with the right connections  in return for the favor gets montana and his friend  manny  steven bauer   released from the holding camp  and puts them to work . in his day  capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain  but lopez has the modern day equivalent  and it  s even more lucrative cocaine . lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life  but once he has a taste of it  montana isn  t satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way  and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top .  with a cold  blooded  iron will  montana decides he  ll do whatever it takes to get there  no matter what the cost . but before it  s over  he will realize the price for his dream  and he  ll pay it but for a brief moment  perhaps he will know what it  s like to be the man . and he will also know whether or not it was worth it .  br    br   in step with de palma  s vision  pacino plays montana larger  than  life  and he does it beautifully . from the accent he affects  which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right   and he did   to the body language and the attitude  he  s got it all  and it makes montana convincing and very real . what he brings to the role is nuance and style  in a way that few actors  de niro would be one  can . this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way  nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacino  s screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character  even though it  s hard to become emotionally involved with him . it  s quite simply a dynamic  memorable performance .  br    br   michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance  as well  in the role that put her on the path to stardom . as elvira  the woman who becomes an integral part of montana  s dream  pfeiffer is subtle and understated  giving that sense of something going on underneath  while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance . she  like pacino  definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic  enigmatic and sultry demeanor .  br    br   the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio  gina   miriam colon  mama montana   f . murray abraham  omar   paul shenar  sosa  and harris yulin  bernstein  . an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic   and blow   and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah  s the wild bunch   de palma  s scarface   originally panned by critics  has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga . much of the violence is implied rather than graphic  but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing . but if you stay with it  there is a lesson to be learned in the end . and like many lessons in life  the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time . but the reward is always worth it  and that  s the way it is with this film . i rate this one     .  br    br    br    br    br    br    
0,hey arnold  is a slow  paced and slightly boring movie . the plot is not very creative . the paul sorvino character  shenk  is buying all of the decrepit  low  priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall  shopping complex and office buildings . this plot goes back to many     s kids movies . it is boring . paul sorvino is not very exciting either  so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary . gramps remembers something about a historical document  and the rest of the movie is about the last   hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga  whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk  s mall . the kids must move around town on buses  and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly  but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids . hey arnold  the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining  and it has enough humor to appeal to adults . the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie . hey arnold the movie  is about five times more sedated  and a good way to put anyone  including kiddies to sleep . hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending . if you want to send your kids to a totally non  offensive movie  this is it . i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a   minute movie  the producers started out with a   minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into   minutes . this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon . hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel .  
1,very sweet pilot . the show reeks of tim burton  s better films . . . edward sissorhands  big fish  charlie  the chocolate factory . the cinematography  the narration  the music  the external sets all scream tim burton . there has to be a connection  or a strong influence  i just haven  t researched enough to know where it is .  br    br   as i  ve seen in the forums  yes anna friel is playing a poor man  s zooey deschanel . every time i see her on the screen i see zooey . don  t get me wrong  anna friel does a great job . her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her . it  s more of a distraction that i keep thinking  why didn  t they get zooey deschanel  .  br    br   lee pace does a great job too . i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up . wonderfalls    great  short lived series from     . if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls  which is another brian fuller creation . hmmmm  br    br   loved seeing swoosie kurtz  world according to garp  and ellen greene  little shop of horrors  again . two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances .  
0,back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister  she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them . vcr  s had just became a household item and we didn  t have but about    movies and we watched the hell out of all of them .  br    br   i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don  t have and i knew this movie looked familiar . i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought . she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing  who knows .  br    br   i didn  t recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes . i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i  d watch and enjoy anything back then .  br    br   i am a horror freak  but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it  good  and this one fell very short . it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types . what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you  re lucky you get that much .  br    br   the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots  so i think this one should be buried and forgotten . don  t watch this people unless you  re hard up .  
1,first ever viewing july         br    br   very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film . now   years old  it has lost none of it  s power . neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations . jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances . neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on .  br    br   one of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all time   br    br   surprisingly  only nominated for  academy awards  best adapted screenplay  and  best film editing  . hollywood rarely awards comedies  no matter how well they are made .  
1,i think dark angel is great  first season was excellent  and had a good plot . with max  jessica alba  as an escaped x    manticore creation  trying to adapt to a normal life  but still  saving the world  . and being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice .  br    br   the second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first . the plot kinda disappeared  and the series lost a little of it  s charm  mostly because of all the weird  creatures  appearing . don  t get me wrong the second season is good  but with a little bit to much of the  manticores  . however  they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season   in which i had a lot of hopes to see more of .  br    br   so i really wish they could start making new episodes . and with james cameron behind this it can  t go wrong . so as a conclusion i would say it  s a great series  however i  m still hoping for a third season   
0,dietrich bonhoeffer  s writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian  and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life . words can hardly express my disappointment . this movie was disjointed . . . it gave no background about his life  no historical context  and nothing about his great writings  except a brief  passing reference to  the cost of discipleship  by a colleague at the beginning of the movie .  instead  we see him enjoying jazz  apparently in the states  and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany . apparently to show his human side . ok  i  m ready for the dramatic part . the part where he stands up for his faith . instead of emphasizing that  we get a very badly acted romance with a    year  old schoolgirl . whether or not that actually took place  it should not have been a major portion of the movie . now . . . still waiting for the dramatic part  or some narration explaining what his writings were all about . . . or something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man . drum  roll . . . . . waiting . . . . . . . . . waiting . . . . . zip . nada . this is the kind of movie that gives  christian films  a bad name . all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow  with some background . . . even some voice  overs  or flashbacks to him preaching from his works . . . some narrative about who he was and where he had been . but no . . . this is what we got . hardly fitting for a hero of the faith .  
0,i just rented and watched this movie just to see what  s all the fuss about . so here  s what my reactions to it are . it  s easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors . the main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists . this concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film . however  the movie doesn  t shock or disturb me at all . it just bored me . this movie could be easily shortened to under   minutes . all lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time  like those scenery scenes and some scenes i described below .  br    br   contains spoiler i find the rape scenes quite tame . i don  t know if i have watched the cut or uncut version  if there is actually such a version . i also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot . here  s a list on top of my mind .  br    br   why don  t the rapists rape jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are . that would be an excellent time .  br    br   why don  t they just gang rape her  instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening jennifer  s ordeal by such a long time . it would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way .  br    br   i found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house . maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles .  br    br   these rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right  they shouldn  t send a coward imbecile to do the job .  br    br   why didn  t jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left  which should be the first thing that pops up in most people  s mind  especially for someone who is a writer .  br    br   why didn  t these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw jennifer is alive   br    br   i find it really amazing that a slender lady like camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him . ends spoiler  br    br   but hey  this movie is not without its merits  camille keaton is gorgeous and i get to hear one of the funniest line i have recently heard when matthew protest of going back into the house and kills jennifer  why me  why me  i didn  t even cm      
0,i and a friend rented this movie . we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging . the movie  s plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending . we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot .  
0,i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie . it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just couldn  t sit through it   though i tried .  br    br   the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call  the mel quotient  . in other words  the better his movie  the less of him you see in the film . think about it   the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all . but  films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies  yes  i did not like space balls   but this isn  t the place to talk about that  .  br    br   second  apart from cancer  rectal itch and mental retardation  i can  t think of a less funny topic than homelessness . this is just a comedy breaker . think about it  folks . the funniest    scene in the movie has mel making whoopee with leslie ann warren in a dumpster   and this is funny in what way   
1,not many movies were made about the lighter  than  air  lta  aspect of aviation  but this is one of them and it  s damn good . just a fun film to watch .  br    br   most of the movie takes place at the navy blimp operations at nas lakehurst  with nas tustin playing the role  . wallace beery plays a likable but munchausen  like senior chief ned trumpet  an enlisted pilot  whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him . half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true .  br    br   set during wwii  the main plot centers around bachelor trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father  son relationship with the widow  s crippled son  jess . told he would never walk without crutches by doctors  chief trumpet pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad  s crippled leg . jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer  flying blimps back at lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges .  br    br   a very well  done movie  albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers  and beery  s apparent inability to march in step . otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy  and gives a rare look into the navy  s lta operations . the cash register scene  an exchange between trumpet and jess  s future love interest cathy  is an absolute hoot .  
0,while some performances were good  victoria rowell  adrienne barbeau  and the two italian girlfriends come to mind  the story was lame and derivative  the emphasis on the girlfriend  s racial background was handled clumsily at best  and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes  not as real people . i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny . i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie  and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb . very disappointed in this movie  and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it  based on the faulty connection to garden state  which is a far funnier  more inventive  and touching movie than this one . i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church  which was so wooden and by  the  numbers that i nearly left  and some in the audience actually did . that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard  which i saw coming   minutes before it happened . i really don  t like being misled to spend my money so uselessly .  
0,you  ve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be  he does have good taste in women . if you pick a seagal movie  chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it . and usually  they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight  shoot guns  kill with knives  etc .  flight of fury  offers the duo of ciera payton  who has a very sexy face  with luscious lips to match angelina jolie  s  and katie jones  and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling  and if it seems like i  m spending a little too much time talking about them  it  s because the rest of the movie  although passable  is so unexciting that it  s hard to find much else to talk about . ironically  the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself  who looks as if he can  t even be bothered to try to pretend to care . this being a military  type actioner  there is very little fighting in it  and he doesn  t fit into his role  a stealth fighter pilot   the best in the world   of course  very well  which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .        
0,i didn  t know if i would laugh or cry seeing this . only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this . this is supposed to be a horror movie but there  s only filth in this . the most cool scene is the car accident  with real special effects from the best of hollywood . avoid this movie at all costs . see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
0,i didn  t know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history  particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon .  br    br   i  ll leave it to pierre berton  noted historian  born and raised in dawson city yukon  and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush  klondike the last great gold rush           to express my exasperation with this silly movie  br    br   the american idea of an untamed frontier  subdued by individual heroes armed with six  guns  was continued in the far country  another story about a cowboy from the american west  wyoming this time  driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country . the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities  but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns  that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness . when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle  the customs shack is empty .  br    br    where is the constable  asks brennan .  br    br    up on the pelly river . trouble with the chilkats   someone replies . he  s got a real tough job  that constable . he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles . sometimes he don  t get home for two or three months at a time .   br    br   the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen . the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike . they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense . they collected customs duties  often over the wails of the new arrivals  made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation  and turned men back if they didn  t have enough supplies  or if they simply looked bad . in true canadian fashion  they laid down moral laws for the community . in dawson the lord  s day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the stern  faced police called  giving a risqu performance in the theatre   generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights .  br    br   in such a community  a gunbelt was unthinkable . one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable  who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly . the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman  upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over .  no man has yet taken a gun away from me   said the american .  well  i  m taking it   the constable said mildly and did so  without further resistance . so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece .  br    br   in      the big year of the stampede  there wasn  t a serious crime  let alone a murder  in dawson . the contrast with skagway on the american side  which was a lawless town run by soapy smith  the denver confidence man  was remarkable . but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law  which a soapy smith character from skagway  he is called gannon in the picture  can easily control .  in real life  one of smith  s men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant  .  br    br   in the movie the lone mountie says  yes i  m the law . i represent the law in the yukon territory . about fifty thousand square miles of it .   br    br    then why aren  t there more of you    br    br    because yesterday this was a wilderness . we didn  t expect you to pour in by the thousands . now that you  re here  we  ll protect you .   br    br    when    br    br    there  ll be a post established here in dawson early in may .   br    br    what happens between now and may  you going to be here to keep order    br    br    part of the time .   br    br    what about the rest of the time    br    br    pick yourselves a good man . swear him in . have him act as marshal   br    br   the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture . his astonishing suggestion  that an american town marshal  complete with tin star  be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence  is accepted . naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part . but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot . and he does . others get shot . even walter brennan gets shot . stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own . he pins on the tin star and he and the bully  gannon  blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax .  br    br   to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north  this bald re  telling of the story passes rational belief .  br    br   excerpt from hollywood  s canada  by pierre berton      .  
0,hip . erotic . wickedly sexy . . . whatever . it  s  the terminator  with werewolves .  br    br   no  seriously . the cop saves the girl  waitress   from the big monster and refers to himself as her  protector  . the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese . . . there  s a massacre in a police precinct . . . the bad guy is muscular with red eyes . . . and it even contains dialogue along the lines of  you said it yourself  he won  t ever stop . never .  the dire script comes from a first  time screenwriter who  thank god  hasn  t sold anything since this  and it  s all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman .  br    br   the movie opens in a strip bar  always a good sign   and a mean  looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason  pursued by three cops . one of them is black  and  shock horror   he  s the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . the film goes downhill for the next hour or so  then picks up a little with some decent action sequences  before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending .  br    br   for the most part  the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who  s willing to settle for less . if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio  along with some of the supporting cast  shows signs of talent . darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder   famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the  friday the   th  movies . he  s decent enough  especially considering he isn  t used to speaking roles .  br    br   it  s become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams  who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former  power rangers  actresses . and it  s unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene . . . anyway  the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good  and the design of the wolf isn  t bad at all . but the cgi is bad . just plain bad . i mean seriously  if you can  t reach some level of realism  why bother  just throw a little extra money into the make  up  aside from the terrible script  this movie does have it  s moments  many of which are unintentionally funny . it  s good for a laugh if you don  t have anything better to do  but just don  t spend any money on it . please .  
1,in a lot of his films  citizen kane  confidential report  touch of evil  orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men . in  the lady from shanghai  it  s the only time i see him holding the role of the victim . the role of the culprit  he gave it to rita hayworth  i guess it  s because he was in love with her . therefore  it  s an interesting film . but i find the story excellent too . the direction is genius  as usual with welles  two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors . this film is brilliant .         
1,when i really began to be interested in movies  at the age of eleven  i had a big list of  must see  films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts . i remember one of the films on that list was  a chorus line  and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come true .  br    br   of course  i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there . i mean  take  a chorus line   a stage play turned into film . i know it  s something we see a lot nowadays  but back then it was a little different  apparently and this film has something special .  br    br   most of the musicals made movies today  take the chance the camera gives them for free  to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places  a chorus line  was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie . following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach  michael douglas   richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job .  br    br   everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing  the stress of having to learn the numbers  the silent competition between the dancersand it all occurs on the stage  where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences . there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic  but they list shortens as the hours go by .  br    br   like a movie i saw recently   a prairie home companion   the broadcast of a radio show  atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity . on or behind the stage  things are going on  and time doesn  t seem to stop . again  i don  t if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this  but it sure doesn  t look like it and anyway it  s a great directing and editing  john bloom  work . but in that little stage  what you wonder is what to do with the camerawith only one setting  ronnie taylor  s cinematography finds the way  making close  ups to certain characters  zooming in and out  showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york .  br    br   in one crucial moment  douglas tells the ones that are left  before we start eliminating you  re all terrific and i  d like to hire you all but i can  t  . this made me think about reality shows today  where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving  even when they are not good  . it  s hard  you must imagine at least here  where all of them really are terrific .  br    br   to tell some of the stories  the characters use songs and  in one second  the stage takes a new life and it literally is  a dream come true  . the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws  showing these dancers  feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett . the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman which is very touching at times . so if it  s not with a song it will be with a word but in  a chorus line   it  s impossible not to be moved .  br    br   during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition  cassie  a special dancer played by alyson reed  takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it . the words  let me dance for you  never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics .  
0,since the   s  writer  producer  director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science  fiction  fantasy and horror b  movies . some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad . trancers       was one of those rare gems .  br    br   a terminator style tale of time  travel and action  trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth  a future cop given the task of tracking down bad  guy whistler  who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor . whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers  converting them into obedient zombies  the  trancers  of the title   and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future . jack follows him to      determined to stop him .  br    br   in this     sequel  jack is still living in     . having destroyed whistler  he has settled down and married leena  helen hunt   the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie . but  for jack  things don  t stay calm for long  and trouble appears in the form of whistler  s brother  e . d . wardo  who is trying to build a trancer army .  br    br   trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was . the story is difficult to pick up if you haven  t seen the first film  or at least not for a long while   and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects . gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one  liners and a script that feels like it was written on  the  fly .  br    br   about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast  which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci  fi and horror movies jeffrey combs  barbara crampton  richard lynch  martine beswicke . unfortunately  most of them seemed to be having an  off day  whilst filming trancers ii  and performances are mediocre at best .  br    br   the trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out . unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing  i can  t imagine them being any good .  
0,this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year . you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here  there are spoilers . gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin  heather graham and tom cavanagh  . only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone else  s eyes as man and wife . no sex but just about everything else . early on  the movie starts with its theme  the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions  . gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch . rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him  she does it and gets to the nitty  gritty questions too . when she signals her brother to come over they start a   way date . charlie  bridget moynahan  is the girl of their dreams  like all the right things etc sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal  that charlie accepts  in one week charlie  gray and sam are to be in vegas . in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding gowns  apparently charlie has an off  the  rack figure  . gray is slurping an iced latte when charlie suggests gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a        frock for her . while charlie is zipping her in this  down  payment  on  a  house  gown gray continues to slurp on the latte  i swear it was like a feed bag  . what should happen but  woops   latte all over the gown . it is never explained how they got out of bloomingdale  s bridal salon with out a        mocha colored gown . back to  reality   caesar  s palace las vegas . they have the  high roller room   sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money   gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a bachelorette drink  a  thon were  you guessed it  they kiss . gray remembers everything charlie remembers nada . they make it to wedding chapel and right when the reverend gets to his line  if there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds  gray gets the hiccups . gray excuses herself  for some reason the reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again  hiccups  . gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets  literally . and of course one is you guessed it again  gay . the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver  alan cummings  named gordy . he is smittened with gray but the feelings are not returned . they become great friends . this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss . he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment . when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office . gray works at an ad agency . this office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone . it has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency . sam gets gray in one of the conference rooms for a not  so  private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office . this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar .  sorry no men  says the bouncer . so gray and gordy return with gordy in drag . bad drag . he was in a sleeveless black satin  like blouse  a string of pearls  and a grandma  s church hat . no lesbian would ever confuse this  man in a dress  as a drag queen much less a woman . the bar was also the straight man  s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victoria  s secret models . everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firm  s client . gray happens to be on the woman  s account and finally does more then kiss . for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray  but that is for the sequel .  
1,the night listener is probably not one of william  s best roles  but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie . i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before . some people maybe won  t like the slow pacing of this movie  but i think it  s the great plus of the movie . it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year     . it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content  dramatic feeling . this is no americanized movie . neither is it a predictable movie . you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be . this is no excellent movie that has everything  but hell  it  s a damn good and very original movie .  
1,the only reason i give this movie an  out of   is because there are few movies  in my opinion  that are perfect . this little b picture is a taut story  well told . i  ve always been intrigued by alexander knox  but have seen him very few movies . here he plays wilhelm grimm  a sad little man who turns into a monster . he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse . the performance is one of the most chilling performances i  ve ever seen . since world war   actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars . i imagine that since this was made during the war  the academy felt like honoring a performance like this would have been like honoring evil . but knox puts in that kind of performance   a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer . i still can  t get over it .  br    br   marsha hunt  who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly  is cast against type in probably the best performance i  ve ever seen her give  too . maybe not oscar worthy  but the best of her career . nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those  slight  roles she often played . but here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama .  br    br   if you like human drama stories  or stories about the fates of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis  i highly recommend this fine little film .  
1,i have a    month old and got really tired of watching care bears all the time . rooney is a great dancer  who cares if he is gay . this guy must have been a cheerleader or something .  br    br   beats barney  cant get the songs out of my head . . . . must . . . stop singing . . . . . . . . doodlebops songs . . . . . . . . now .  br    br   must have   lines of text so i must continue . . . . . what about when the say all the canadian stuff like ooout aboooot . whacky canadians . . . . . jazmine is rhyming too much  she must be dutch .  br    br   knock knock  who  s there  dee dee  super hottie  br    br   bus driver bob cannot dance  take lessons from rooney  
0,whatever his name is  the writer and director  should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again . this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time . sometimes movies are bad in a way that they  re actually sort of good . not this one . this was so bad i got angry . seriously . a drunken   year old could have come up with a better script . what a waste . all the actors were completely uninspired to work at all  the cgi was barely acceptable  the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was  it  s like he just decided   i want this to happen and this to happen  but i don  t care how we got there  just shoot it and put it in . whatever  i  m going back to my trailer to pick my nose  if anyone calls for me  i  m not here .  shame on you whatever your name is . shame on you .  
0,from the star of  mitchell   from the director of  joysticks  and  angel  s revenge     these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie . and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true    ugghhh . . . joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film . it  s like a bad remake of  coogan  s bluff   
1,the combination of the superb black and white photography and the  eugene onegin with a twist  plot made this a real knock out for me . the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping . there was a superb moment where where transparencies  apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly  were shown accompanied by lensky  s heart  wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin .  br    br   for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium  which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere  last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film . krisana is in the same mould .  
0,this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see . it is painfully long and awfully directed . i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end . run time is way over  hrs which could have been edited to less then  hrs .  br    br   transition between stories is average . most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out .  br    br   its funny only in pockets . ambitious project and a below par execution . govinda does a fair job  anil kapoor disappointed me  rest we as expected . if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close .  
0,it  s amazing to see how nikhil advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release . i mean . . . . . look at the cast here  the promotion is superb  good enough songs and the trailers are fine . this makes it a house full on the first day  but it  s only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable . house full the first day  the movie is out the next week .  br    br   this film  inspired by  love actually  is what they say  didn  t manage to handle the whole cast well . they tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one . the stories are hollow and cheesy  so the audience can  t connect with any single one of them . it  s a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter nikhil advani after his big success of  kal ho na ho  .  
1,i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store . it was in almost mint condition  and i  d never heard of it before . clearly nobody else had either .  br    br   i can  t believe my luck . you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message  the very moral and non  triumphalist stance of the mandela party  undoubtedly . despite its enormous length  i had to watch it in two sittings   it was like a book one couldn  t put down . perhaps the songs are not all that memorable  but the spirit of the thing glows on forever . i cannot understand comments that a musical  clearly designed for stage  is not realistic  i  ve seen  south pacific  and read the book too  and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book . i  ll treasure this little find until it wears out . one day they  ll make this again on a better budget .  br    br    
0,i am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho  hum event . wm c quantrill was barely shown in the film  probably the most intriquing figure of the period . frank james was never mentioned  cole younger  ditto  and bloody bill anderson  who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script . instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about . how sad . the costumes were wonderful however  as was the location shooting in missouri . i hope ang lee will make another film from the period and try again  or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .  
1,people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production . i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd  and honestly its one of the best classes i  ve had  its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated . i originally watched  joy of life  for another class where harry did a voice over in the film  and started watching this film after i started the class . harry originally did some performance work  and is really genuine about creating moments that move you  especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment  but its something you see in this film .  
0,this film was probably inspired by godard  s masculin  fminin and i urge you to see that film instead .  br    br   the film has two strong elements and those are     the realistic acting    the impressive  undeservedly good  photo . apart from that  what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness . lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world . she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film  . . . it  s unattractive . comparing to godard  s film  intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity . without going too far on this subject  i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society .  br    br   a movie of its time  and place .     .  
1,one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema  or  indeed  most anything done outside these holier  than  thou united states  are the permutations that crop up . in post  world war two japanese manga  comics   for instance  are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects  many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion . the same thing happens in genre film  making  as well though  again  i  m referring to movies made outside the u .  .  where we  re just too  sophisticated  in our close  mindedness to appreciate anything that isn  t about or by us  . would an american company  for instance  back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler  el santo  or a werewolf  paul naschy  or a real  life martial artist  bruce lee  . . .  as for television forget it . while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine  i  ve always felt that the americanized version of asian martial arts was  how to put it kindly  a bit lacking . to this very day  there hasn  t been a pay  per  view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia .  there are lots of soft  core porn masquerading as entertainment shows  but the so  called action channel  for instance  has yet to import or to produce a true martial arts teleseries .  before brother cadfile was investigating murders on the bbc  there was  of all things  at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the  deadly venoms . in its own right as fascinating as any other genre  based whodunit  western  cop show  etc .   this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work . it  s now available from dragon dynasty and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by bey logan is exactly the kind of intelligent  thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve . if you  re a martial arts movie fan  rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time  specifically  the martial arts movies of the     s and early     s  are getting a long  overdue second life  and greatly appreciated second look  on dvd .  
0,after watching this i thought to myself  there are either too few good writers  directors or lots of producers .  br    br   at any rate  this is a terrible movie . terrible in a way that it  s not fun  but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver . makes you shout  this is wrong  at the movie . immersion is zero . by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors  weirdness  es in movies that has computers hackers etc . in them . this movie is like that in every aspect .  br    br   the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily  brilliantly played by eliza bennett . i hope she becomes big  and make this . . thing at least worth something .  br    br   do yourself a favor . don  t watch this . there is not even proper action in it . total waste of time .  
1,i may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film . i also saw this movie when it came out  and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead of its  time . the humor in the film itself is pure mad magazine . i don  t see why mad stand behind this feature . it was also one of the few films of the early    s to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from l . a . at the time . i own the soundtrack and i play it constantly to this day . what can i say  there are definitely worst movies out there . i don  t consider porky  s to be as funny as up the academy  there are some really good laughs throughout the film  and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid . hey  nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon .  
1,horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies . i  m not very fond of them myself  but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema . the house that dripped blood is a horror omnibus  featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a scotland yard officer by an estate agent .  br    br   this film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema peter cushing  christopher lee and ingrid pitt  whom horror fans will recognise as one of lee  s co  stars in the greatest british horror film of all time the wicker man .  br    br   the first segment of the film  titled  method for murder  tells the story of a horror storywriter  whose creation a strangler named  dominic  is brought to life by his own imagination . this story builds suspense very well through his girlfriend  he  and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination . this story certainly isn  t very original  but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it  s final twist which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise .  br    br   the second story  titled  waxworks   stars peter cushing and is my least favourite of the four . this tale follows the story of phillip grayson  cushing   a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in . inside  he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess . quite what the woman  s relationship with phillip entailed is never really explained  but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details . cushing is later joined by his friend  neville rogers  played by joss ackland  and that  s when the tale really starts to pick up . the setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn  t a new idea the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent     horror film   chamber of horrors  . although the one here isn  t as grand as the one in the aforementioned film  the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect  much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia  brought about by the limited area of the museum . peter cushing is always interesting to watch  and seeing him avoid an axe  wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan . despite being my least favourite  this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down .  br    br   the film continues with  sweets for the sweet   which is without doubt the best of the omnibus . this story stars the legendary christopher lee as a seemingly overprotective father . the beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out . it leaves the audience guessing we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter  but we don  t know who  or what  it is . christopher lee  as usual  portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll  and the fact that she isn  t allowed to go to school or have any toys . the card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end  epitomised by the truly chilling line in which lee tells his babysitter that he is  in fact  afraid of his daughter . the ending to this section is superbly played out  in my opinion it  s one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told  and will stay with you long after the end credits roll .  br    br   the omnibus finishes with  the cloak   which is definitely the most comedic of the four . this tale is about a hammy horror film star that  unimpressed by his latest film  s technical side  goes out and buys himself a cloak . naturally  this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak . unlike the other three tales  this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs . that is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film . the ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film  which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film . also  look out for the little jibe regarding christopher lee in dracula . a nice touch  i think .  br    br   overall  if you want a horror omnibus  you really cant go wrong with the house that dripped blood . the third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed .  
0,this movie really shows its age . the print i saw was terrible due to age  but it is possible that there are better prints out there . however  this was not the major problem with the movie . the problem was that although the film was made in      it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered  only a few sentences  in the film in the most amateur fashion . sometimes the characters  backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces   all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and  cleaverly     hide the fact that the film was dubbed . well  its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious . it just looked cheap .  br    br   overall  the film looked low budget and silly . it  s really a shame though  because there was a grain of a good story   a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and  or has no interest in women . but in the   st century  few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess . even with a few glimpses of the naked  and somewhat chunky  hedy lamarr  it isn  t worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted . even by     standards  this film was a poorly made dud . about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in     compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america   she looks like  completely different people .  br    br   it  s such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film  i don  t see how it has gotten such rave reviews . for technical problems alone  the movie can  t rate a   or anything near it .  
1,a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches . . . . people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear . also  alas  an ending that comes out of nowhere  because  apparently  the auteur has lost interest in the movie  or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot .  
1,this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos  though some of the details are still there  the setup is completely different . that makes this columbo unique  and interesting to watch  even though at times you might wish for the old columbo . i liked it a lot  but then  i like almost any columbo .  
0,apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is . at one point in this film  someone  i believe pacino  s producer  warns him that film is getting off track  that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii . instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout . some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al  was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare  s birthplace  other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there    and  before the film has really even begun  we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera . i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act  but apparently it  s how al really behaves in person .  br    br   enough rambling . here  s a shotgun smattering of why i didn  t even make it    of the way through this   pretentious  al always knows when the camera is on him  whether he  s acting as richard or in a  real  conversation with someone  you can see it in the corner of his eyes  also  some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme . if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside  it  s unbearable .  look at me  chewing all the scenery     winona ryder . when she appears as lady anne  this film comes to a screeching halt  which it never recovers from . she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes . her performance is dreadful  to boot .   the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture . of course  you also learn that pacino shouldn  t be directing films  or doing richard in the first place  . i  d rather watch bobby deerfield than this .  br    br   lastly  read the play and learn it for yourself . go out and see it performed . in     i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater  and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama  except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence  my god  was that necessary     br    br   it  s all just a bunch of sound and fury  signifying nada .  
0,quite simply this shouldn  t have been made . it  s predictable and clichd . the on screen chemistry which made the first  my girl  so captivating is nowhere to be found here  and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced . the writing also leaves much to be desired  some of the  memorable  lines such as  earpeircing a barbaric custom  are just shocking . where  my girl  provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments  like so many sequels  my girl   tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience  and fails miserably . maybe i  m being hard on this film because of how great the first one was  but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up . surely this has to come close to  son of the mask  as being one of the worst sequels of all time . in both cases  the old saying rings true  if it ain  t broke  don  t fix it  .  
0,someone had a great idea let  s have misty mundae do her own  r  rated version of lara croft  firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits  but topless as well . it was indeed a great idea . the problem is that the people who had it couldn  t come up with any sort of script or budget to support it . therefore  we get a  film  that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts  often in slow  motion   and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage . the appeal of misty mundae is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl  next  door beauty . however her two female co  stars here  with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene  are nowhere near her league . if  mummy raider  was presented as a youtube video  i  d rate it higher  but as a  film  destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than    a  out of  .  
0,i know it  s a power  rangers gimmick and catered to  year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie  if they are going to write a plot with crayons  at least have the decency to make it silly . it  s kind of hilarious if you watch this . we have a typical family filled with cliched characters  father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself lolol   air  head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting  and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space . funny stuff   br    br   however  the real great moment comes near the end when war  dad and bad  acting  villain try to work a sword fight  but then they realize none of them know how to  probably because no room in budget for choreographers   so they come up with this american gladiator type setting to run around in . lol .  br    br       rating because they try to treat this seriously .  
0,i think that  s this is awful produced and directed movie . benicio del toro shouldn  t work in production of movies  he should put accent on his acting and that  s it . steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution  about it  s ideals  and most important about life of che guevara and so on . camera is awful  like someone with  day working experience is shooting with it  music is . . . i don  t know . . is there some music in the movie     i will not recommended this piece of sh . . to no one . it  s just wasting about  hours in front of the tv or whatever . . . . i can  t figure out how can someone rate this movie more than  stars . disaster . . . . disaster . . . . disaster . . . . disaster don  t watch please . save yourself from this misery of  movie   
0,good lord  what were they thinking         here is your spoiler warning  even though i don  t think it  ll really matter . you won  t be seeing this piece of trash anyway .  br    br   a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people  who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them  and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies . in other words  the whole thing is really stupid .  br    br   you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can  t save something   and they didn  t  i know  some of their lines were funny  like what to add to the sign  hit  and the hand comments  but  geez  this was pretty dang sad .  br    br   all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud . it is not worth your eyes .  
0,this movie started out good  i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld . much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters  and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing . all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny . dan cortese was amazing . i loved him in this role . his agent should show this movie to casting agents . watch the first few scenes and then find something better  or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess . i found this in a bin at a video store . it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price .  
0,minor spoilers as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet  hobgoblins  stands apart from all others in it  s own unique way . classic baddies such as  the creeping terror    the mighty gorga  and  manos  are uniformly bad from start to finish .  hobgoblins  on the other hand  starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes . during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film . i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer . the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept  club scum  sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another . with just this one film  director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time . how bad can a bad movie be  watch  hobgoblins  and wonder no longer .  
0,this kind of  inspirational  saccharine is enough to make you sick . it telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth . it removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it . the big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car i guess you  d need such prompting to feel if you  re stupid enough to watch a film as simple  minded and sappy as this . streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it  s just that    a display  switched on and off like a light . because i can  t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film . even though it  s based on a true story  and an inspirational one at that i  m sure  the set  up  execution and performances play like a third  rate tv movie or half  witted high school drama .  
1,the first von trier movie i  ve ever seen was breaking the waves . sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa . europa tells a story of a young german  american who wants to experience germany just after the second world war . he takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train . because of his job  he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany  meeting with the killing of traitors  and hunt for former nazi party members . the society is suffering from corruption . his uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train . by coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called  werewolves  they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains . the atmosphere is astounding . the viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene . just when you think you  ve seen a lot        europe    
1,what  s good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan . doesn  t rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its  gotcha  moments . even if you  ve seen everything  there  s still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop .  br    br   what could have been better about it the acting was  at times  flat and unconvincing . it had a  shot  on  video  quality in some places  though  it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for   and the camera work is full of needless close  ups of meaningless actions . though the effects are genuinely creepy  i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them . the ending seemed rushed  and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments . the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves  not as a challenge by the filmmakers  but because they just missed it .  br    br   still  a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average . well worth the rental .  
0,the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it  the crazy filmdirector  the rest of the movie was just boring . in the first hour or so nothing really happens . jokes which supposed to be funny aren  t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting . julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck  yeah right   into the girl next door  where did i see this before   who gets the guy . for short . i really didn  t care what would happen with the main characters . if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch .  
0,this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline . the problem is  frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l . paul bremer in to tell his side of the story . more troubling is the fact that the director of the film  charles ferguson   a former think tank wonk  was a war supporter until the occupation went south . what did he think would happen   br    br   the invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky nazis . and that is what this film feels like   an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself .  br    br   ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better   as if any war can be better .  
0,i just finished a marathon of this series  and it became agonising to watch as it progressed . from the fictionalising of the historical elements  to o  herlihy  s awful accent in later episodes  the show just slumps the further it goes . if you are looking for some low quality production generalised ww  fluff  then i could recommend season   but avoid anything after that  it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera  with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility .  br    br   the old bw film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it  and even that is not what one could hope for .  
0,i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason  herb  evers constant harping on experiment . many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting . yet  as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done . jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune  and his overacting is exactly that .  br    br   most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors  minus evers and the showgirls . if you watch this movie  you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line  that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose .  br    br   the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one . in hindsight  there isn  t much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie .  
1,one of the great classic comedies . not a slapstick comedy  not a heavy drama . a fun  satirical film  a buyers beware guide to a new home .  br    br   filled with great characters all of whom  cary grant is convinced  are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home .  br    br   a great look at life in the late    s .  br    br    
1,i am not a parent  neither am i a male . but i was able to identify with every character  s heartaches and pains .  br    br   this is a movie teenagers should watch . maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again . i  m sorry for those that don  t understand the value of love  family and friendship .  br    br   it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing . and it is great to see a   year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance . he showed at an early age  that he is capable of heartfelt drama . he should be offered more serious roles . note hollywoodland . . . his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in     .  br    br   this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages . maybe shouldn  t be watched by children under   because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families  but i recommend it to the entire family .  br    br   i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times . because it portrays the values that are important in life .  
1,from the upper shelf of great classic books  comes this masterful story written by pearl buck . the book like the movie is called  the good earth .  it relates the story of wang lung  paul muni  a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the  great house  where he has taken a slave woman called o  lan  luise rainer  and made her his wife . almost from the beginning  she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home . during the following years  o  lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband  s toil  troubles and changing fortunes . through the passing years  they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine . indeed  it  s at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship  loyalty and love . with the changing times  their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives  like their uncle  walter connolly  who is a scoundrel and charlatan  but is compassionately tolerated . wang has his  old father   charley grapewin  to advise and remind him of life  s fragile and fickle nature . two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wang  s elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier . the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel . highly recommended for all audiences .   
0,based on the average short story by horror writer stephen king about so called  sleepwalkers  ancient and immortal cat  like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them they have supernatural abilities  they can make themselves  dim  which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people . they have been fleeing humans for century  s we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left . the film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town  they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on . the mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin  he does  madchen amick  and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry . it is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out virgins herself  it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy . however his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back  jabbing a pencil in to his ear . the police are called and the hunt is on  . the son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore . finally the girl kills the mother  end of movie . this movie is rubbish  . the acting is variable  from the average brian krause to the excellent alice krige . the special effects are average  and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time . the direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places . the director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical . stephen king makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does mark hamill  as a puzzled cop . alice krige seems to shoulder the film  her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction .  
0,i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations . the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good  right  how wrong i was .  br    br   i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey  a director  writer of wiseguy making his feature debut  blah  . . . well the director  writer of edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man  because i cannot see how he  along with the other actors in the film  would ever agree to be in this disaster .  br    br   this movie is absolutely appalling  it  s a mixture of every cop hard boiled clich ever . there is nothing new with edison . the acting was bad and the direction was even worse . it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy . this was the best casted direct to video movie i  ve ever seen .  br    br   some examples of just bad silly moments in edison . . . morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music . . . justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles . . . llcoolj driving a vintage firebird . . .  guys being shot in the head . . .  br    br   this movie is the opposite of good .  br    br   stay away from edison   
1,this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv  but it is one of the best movies i  ve seen . the film and its actors won several awards . it is gripping  fascinating  and it will absorb you completely . the story of a chase for a killer in iron  curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction   but it  s ostensibly a true story . i highly recommend it .  
0,this could be a strong candidate for  the worst flick ever  . perhaps without the presence of john hurt  it could be tolerated as a kid  film . however  the tragedy of this entire endeavor  is that john hurt  one of the screen  s greatest actors  diminishes himself in this . . . . i gave it two points just because mr . hurt showed up . . . i take away  points  because he didn  t run from it fast enough . as far as the rest of the cast  they are  simply  terrible . janine turner  as pretty as she might be  cannot act to save her soul . and the lead actor is  for all intents and purposes  awful . if you can spare yourself this embarrassment  please do so . it  s so bad  it almost hurts .  
0,van damme . what else can i say  bill goldberg . there we go . now we know this movie is going to be really horrible .  br    br   i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs  knowing it would be bad . but not even i thought it would be this bad . the plot is awful  van damme is getting old  finally   but unlike arnold  his movies are as well .  br    br   forget this movie . don  t see it . ever . i wouldn  t even be paid to see this film .  br    br      stars  at its heart lies a wonderful  action  packed thrill ride .  br    br   well  maybe not  but the marketers would sure like us to think so  wouldn  t they   br    br   john ulmer  
1,pialat films people in extreme emotional situations  usually with several violent scenes . in la gueule ouverte  he  s dealing with the devastating effects on a woman  s husband and son as she dies of cancer . in a nos amours  the teenage girl  s sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family . here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex  con . her motivation is a little cloudy  since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows on the other hand  he  s got a fabulous body  i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique   he would have been great as a rugby player  .  br    br   the casting is impressive . isabelle huppert isn  t allowed to give a bland  inexpressive performance  she has given many   depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want   see the scene in the bar  where he  s stabbed in the gut  runs away and seeks treatment  then soon restarts with nelly . guy marchand  with those coal  black eyes and distressed look  plays nelly  s husband beautifully it  s a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre .  
0,this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime . cool title  excellent director  i saw  to die for  and  drugstore cowboy  before this   and hey  uma thurman in the cast . how can you go wrong  well  that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey .  br    br   disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat  this is a dead  zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs . its critical lambasting was well deserved . you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality . zero out of  .  
1,great acting  great movie . if you are thinking of building see this movie first . the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same . the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt .  
1,  the kennel murder case  starts off at a run and doesn  t stop until the very end . everybody had reason to kill the victim  and several people tried . william powell is terrific as philo vance  gentleman detective . mary astor is refreshing as the put  upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance . this movie comes paired with  nancy drew  reporter  on dvd  which is also fun . if you have to rent the disc  or check it out from your local library   do it . it  s pure entertainment   
0,do not see this movie if you value your mind . at the end of our collective viewing  me and my friends estimated that we each lost   of our brains during its course . the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer .  br    br   most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth . i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion  this movie has bred a deep hatred within me . i hate this movie so very  very much .  br    br   some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously . if only it didn  t take itself seriously . but it does . the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner  esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies . the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful . whoopee goldberg isn  t even trying  but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul . and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree  aka shaft  as the blustering commissioner  you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment .  br    br   i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall .  
0,as a huge fan of only the first  seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days . usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects . if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent . this prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it . the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous  unbelievable . this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to restricted . not that teens don  t love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex  violence  heavy dance music . its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth  reason or political  religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me . these kids are definitely not from this planet . the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last   minutes being slightly interesting . the scene with eric stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining . but this old concept was far better portrayed  much more believable in the brilliant  classic original  frankenstein  with boris karloff . caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film . no surprise there  overall this movie was bland  unoriginal  cheap looking  using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg . i doubt i  ll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the sci  fi channel . unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure . zzzzzzzz  
0,there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent . this was one of those times . i almost gave up with only   minutes left to endure . . . and i wish i had . . .  br    br   the pace that a man goes from a straight  laced  controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid .  br    br   from a graduation celebration to the predictable ending tristan price  jesse metcalfe  man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman  by violence  and by mind altering substances . of course  the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful april  nathalie kelley  . but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs  violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand .  br    br   frankly  besides being able to stare at nathalie kelley and monica keena  this film has no redeeming qualities . save your money  save your time . . . do anything else . . .  
0,the     michael keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it  s  um  shoddy special effects  but compared to what screaming mad george cooked up for this horror comedy they  re positively mind  boggling . the killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts . which they probably were . the cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other  much worse  movies and paul keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role .  
0,yuck . i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written . the acting is so apathetic at times and so over  dramatic at other times . why would a  demonico  kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal  just for the heck of it  and is it really necessary to show lilith  s motorcycle whenever she  s out somewhere . we get it  you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket . it doesn  t mean you have to show it all the time  the  faith  s  lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes . there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about   seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance . everyone is a throwaway character . forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill  conceived movies i  ve seen the scifi channel come out with . stay away unless you  re into bad movies .  
0,i am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person . every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early   s with only two exceptions have i reviewed  so you can tell i am a major fan . it  s because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch . i loved this man  s films and kept thinking  buster  how could you    . well  now that i think about it  i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god  awful episode of the twilight zone . he  d lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early     s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well . now  in the     s  keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay   appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series .  br    br   the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better . the show is supposed to be funny but isn  t and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch   particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick . do yourself a favor  skip this one   it  s a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton  s career     
0,this film was horrible . the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real  world  the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school .  br    br   i do not recommend this film to anyone who a  knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations . b  knows any detail about film making or appreciation .  br    br   i do recommend this film to the average or below  average mind  i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber . if you must watch this film on a full mind  i highly recommend some kind of inebriation  br    br   it is a total waste of what little production value it has .  
0,this movie is terrible . the suspense is spent waiting for a point . there isn  t much of one .  br    br   aside from a few great lines   i found a tooth in my apartment    and the main characters dedication to killing himself  it  s a collection of supposedly eerie sounds .  br    br    
1,first off  anyone looking for meaningful  outcome oriented  cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated  emotive  heartfelt thespians  please leave now . you are wasting your time and life is short  go see the new brangelina jolie movie  have a good cry  go out  buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better  and leave us alone .  br    br   don  t let the door hit you on the way out either . the incredible melting man is a grade b minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of oklahoma by a young  tv friendly cast  crew  and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects  wakes up in a hospital  and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump . the melting man is played by one alex rebar  who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film . but once he starts oozin  with rick baker  s extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny  viscous blebs of grease .  br    br   the film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points there are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care  really . it  s a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it   one great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out . hilarious .  br    br   the  hero  of the film is played by burr debenning  a fascinating character actor from the golden     s    s television scene who was sort of an early model for the kevin spacey prototype slightly twisted  neurotic  and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused . he appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for tv anthology horror piece called house of the dead  or the alien zone  that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in oklahoma  which is where i suspect this film was made as well . the arid  cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same  and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that cameron mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in without warning . . . which also had a sick sense of humor  a tv friendly cast  and some pretty outrageous gore . i definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies  as well as the silence of the lambs which is of no surprise considering that director jonathan demme is a part of melting man  s cast .  br    br   essentially  as others have pointed out  this is a     s b movie plot updated for later     s era special effects  the inevitable boobs . the movie it probably borrows most of it  s ideas from is phantom from space with peter graves as an astronaut who also returns to earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree . one of the things that i actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man  s motivations he simply goes on a rampage and the movie  s drama comes from wondering if he  s going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness . the budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen  rick baker  s disgusting effects getting the lion  s share of whatever was spent on this .  br    br   sick  disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer . why can  t people have made more movies like these   br    br        
0,the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts  demons named brother dominic  francesco carnelutti  is found dead  cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier  heath ledger  is contacted by top  brass cardinal driscoll  peter weller  who ask  s him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominic  s death . along with his girlfriend mara willims  shannyn sossamon   fellow priest thomas garrett  mark addy  alex travels to italy to delve into his mentor  s death  as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a  sin eater  someone who absorbed other  s sins  lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully  that the church wasn  t happy about his activities . alex must do what  s right even if it goes against what he believes . . .  br    br   also know under the title the sin eater this american german co  production was written  produced  directed by bian helgeland  didn  t really do that much for me if i  m honest  i usually am  honest that is . anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it  s throughly predictable  excruciatingly dull  boring  really silly at times  it takes itself far too seriously . the whole concept is daft  while it thinks it  s clever with it  s oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up  brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious  lazy way to end things . there  s the usual religious themes here  morality  sin  forgiveness  faith  belief  prophecy  s  blah  blah  blah you know the sort of thing . then there  s the twists which aren  t hard to see coming  there  s the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen  corruption  greed  evil  etc . you know the sort of clichd hollywood ideals  themes that get reused every time it deals with the church . the order has nothing new to say  as a serious piece of film  making it sucks  a lot . i  m not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to  as a die  hard horror fan i didn  t see much horror in this at all  as a thriller it  s less than thrilling  as a mystery it  s too predictable  there  s nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest  for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it  s as exciting  action  packed as the average episode of sesame street       present   harsh maybe but it  s what i think . . .  br    br   director helgeland does an ok job  the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme  it all looks a bit drab  grayish  dull . for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements  in fact there aren  t any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason  don  t ask . forget about any gore or violence as there isn  t any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable . according the imdb  s  trivia  section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny  all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren  t exactly brilliant as it stands now .  br    br   i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about            which is a hell of a lot of money  i just can  t see where it all went apart from the sets  production design which are good . the whole film looks  feels very average  utterly forgettable . the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul  mouthed comic relief irritates  a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than this .  br    br   the order  i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much  misses all of it  s intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i  m concerned  is a pretty dull way to waste    odd minutes of your life so don  t do it  not recommended .  
0,the worlds largest inside joke . the world  s largest  most exclusive inside joke .  br    br   emulating the brash and  everyman  humor of office space  this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books . the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary  and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist .  br    br   the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time  listening to music and writing a novel while working . these are his goals . you can  t imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when  around halfway through  they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria  but then gives it up  the director and screenwriter  jacob kornbluth and josh kornbluth  completely remove the audience  s motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof .  br    br   apart from that major stumbling block  the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen . without these asides  the audience wouldn  t have noticed anything particularly strange . humor is only effective if it doesn  t need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny .  
0,this movie is by far the worst movie ever made . if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don  t make the damn film . i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space  times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie . adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace . watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender . anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime . if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it  i  d give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie .  
0,it  s not my fault . my girlfriend made me watch it .  br    br   there is nothing positive to say about this film . there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can  t . there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only middling . an embarrassment all round .  br    br    
0,as the faux  russian scientist says two  thirds of the way into the movie   i came for the science .  this pretty much sums up the reason i watched this movie  anything that involves a half  man  half  hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist . or  as they say in the biz  my girlfriend  s brother had the remote and the rest is history . to say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects . this is      it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background . yeah  this was charming and state of the art when hitchcock was filming  the birds  but in     it just looks low budget . spare me the cheap attempt at sci  fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief .  br    br   however  having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film  let me tell you again that  as sad as it may sound  this is probably worth your time . if nothing else  it is a tour de force of bad sci  fi  worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day .  br    br   the crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind  but also the ability of  b  movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines .  br    br   this film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions  bad guys always wear sunglasses .  br    br   if this weren  t      i would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war . i mean  you might as well have khan on the bridge of a klingon bird of prey inserting leaches into chekhov  s ear .  br    br   one of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the charlton heston lookalike   wait for tom  as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground . the thing is  tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never  ending banana clip attached to his kalashnikov  or ak     in layman  s terms .  br    br   as the mad scientist says near the end of the film   my goal is to evolve the human species   suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind . the faint freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about .  
0,why did i waste my time with this movie  there was not a single funny joke or line throughout . the slapstick wasn  t even mildly funny . i mean really  an out of control vacuum sucking pipe  why has the national lampoon  s name been attached to this movie  even christmas vacation was better than this  i actually thought that film was very funny  .  br    br   avoid like the plague   
0,there is so much that is wrong with this film  but to sum it up terrible acting  so bad it must have been on purpose . poor script  they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story . ridiculously bad ending  in some cases the ending manages to save the film  not in this case . if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for . this is the worst film i have seen in a long time . it was complete torture sitting through this film  i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance . so do yourself a favor . watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do . even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture .  
1,while the movie does feel a bit long at times  it is well worth it . gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles . merciless  thoughtful  ironic  quirky  and dark  this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while  begging for answers to impossible questions . nolte  goodman  and arkin are all incredible . sheryl lee is wonderful as well  in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura  maddy days . do not miss this one   
0,i like a lot of the actors  actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns . the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers . in   or   years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early    s . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot  s and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music . the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana  n . w . a  public enemy  soundgarden etc . the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the    s and i gurantee you nbc will do it . see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren  t thinking i am living in the    s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time . next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project  
1,forget neo and bourne and all those half  baked made up modern heroes . they only look   year  oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes . since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones  hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick .  br    br   however  their  action set  pieces  are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question . this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years . for better  rocky  rambo  or worse  die hard   where john mcclane  brace yourselves . . . . had no beard     br    br   i say it is high  time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end . this  largo winch  movie is far from perfect  and perhaps too predictable at times  but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action  hero . and the only one time where he was weakened is when mlanie thierry shaved his beard  i rest my case .  br    br   i didn  t know it when i entered the theater room  but this might be the movie i  ve been waiting for a decade . for the first time in france since belmondo  can a movie be both well  crafted and rooted in b  genre without blushing over its performance . in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience . . . in other words it was  le pacte des loups  or  dobermann   i like dobermann  mind you  . . . i believe  largo winch  has what it takes to be both popular and quality film  making .  br    br   i exited the theater room very pleased  and hungry for more .  
0,i  m a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians  however . as a rule  they are  know  nothings  when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however  they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible  and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion  one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made  but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however  in this  critique   those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short  the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen  and i would not recommend it to anyone  except for comic relief from the every day grind .  
1,when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley kubrick  s other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would be . at times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn  t take my eyes of the screen still there  s something very disturbing about everything in the film . now some people don  t like kubrick  s version of the shining since it doesn  t entirely follow stephen king  s book but in my opinion both kubrick  s version  the mini  series and the book are all great . jack nicholson gives an awesome performance . if you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining .  
0,will they ever make movies without nudity and sex  this came on at     on sunday afternoon and i couldn  t believe what they showed . thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft  medium porn  do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt  kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show       the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee  there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie . randy travis was really good in his role . if the writers  directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes . what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction  where can i complain   
1,great movie  enough laughs and action for any audience .  br    br   since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film  here i am .  br    br   the film follows an unlikely duo  johansson and allen  as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter . their search takes them into the home of the killer  and eventually to a somewhat tragic end . but don  t let the plot fool you  the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb .  br    br   it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right . clint eastwood  allen and pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers . also  from watching the movie in a pact theater  you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback . the second he walked on screen audience lit up . there  s just something about the man and he really shines in scoop .  br    br   check it out  it  s worth the trip .  
1,  they all laughed  is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves  and why  their are many reasons the fact that it  s set in new york which truly sets the tone  the fantastic soundtrack  the appealing star turns from ben gazzara  and the late john ritter who is superb . and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn . the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties  film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak  the films co  producer  and john ritter  basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate  s wife  hepburn  and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production   they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans .  
1,i nominate this and babylon  as the best television sci  fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series  there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trektng  they were fine shows  but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways  you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space   with its giant battles that took up all of the final season  and the other trek shows  as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon  and saw this to an even greater extent with sg   . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure  there were a few  throwaway  episodes that were not connected to the rest  but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny .  br    br   and speaking of funny  i loved that sg   kept the mood light from time to time and wasn  t so dreadfully serious . in this way  i actually enjoyed it more than babylon  . jack o  neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson   it  s really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons .  br    br   to truly appreciate sg    you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and  if you don  t like sg   after giving it a fair chance  then sci  fi is probably not the genre for you .  
1,franco proves  once again  that he is the prince of surreal  erotic cinema . true  much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus  necronomicon  he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work . jerry van rooyen  s splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist  reynaud  who may be schizophrenic  or may indeed  as one mysterious character states  be a devil  attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits . a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema .  
1,a masterpiece of comedy  a masterpiece of horror  a masterpiece of romance  if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story  it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology . the film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt . of course  it happens to be haunted as well .  br    br   what i wasn  t expecting the first time i saw this film is that it  s one of the most touching love stories i  ve ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches . unlike some films of asian cinema  a chinese ghost story isn  t hard to swallow for those that aren  t versed in chinese culture . indeed  it plays on timeless  cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance .  br    br   think evil dead   if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix . this film is for real  despite being overlooked by many . it  s absolutely among the best i  ve ever seen . it  s ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres  and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere  is nothing short of fantastic . highly recommended       .  
0,this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest  in my opinion . a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her . and at this point  i will say that these films are not real  they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible .  br    br   the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases . for example  when they kick the girl in the floor  we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl  and how stupid this looks  the sound effects are also unrealistic and don  t make sense . other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl  the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours  the ripping off of fingernails  worms placed on the wounds in the girl  s body  the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig  although it is not as bloody as the next part  flowers of flesh and blood  which tries to be as shocking as possible .  br    br   guinea pig devil  s experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i  ve seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . this is still  of course  faked s  n  t  uff  the only difference to genuine  snuff film  is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film . i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so sy and repulsive . they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . i watched this as a curiosity  as the other parts in the series  and now i know how insignificant trash these are . they work only in shock level and that  s not too valuable cinematic achievement . devil  s experiment is perhaps the sickest film i  ve seen and mermaid in a manhole  guinea pig   is perhaps the most disgusting film i  ve seen . so these are pretty extreme in my book  but that  s all they are .  
1,one of the most heart  warming foreign films i  ve ever seen .  br    br   the young girl is an amazing talent . stellar performances by her  doggie   the old man  the king of masks   and liang  the living boddhisatva  .  br    br    spoiler  the deplorable treatment of children  especially females is disturbing .  br    br   loved the music . the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story .  br    br   this is a must see   enjoyable family film  although not for very young children . would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .  
0,like with any movie genre  there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies . if you asked me to name a good gangster movie  i  d have dozens to choose from . if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie  probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you  the last time . that film is  the general   unrelated to the     silent film of the same name . this is a very dry  very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story  it  s more than easy to follow  but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor .  br    br   like  goodfellas        and  american gangster        two superior mob movies  the general  is based on real people and true events . the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill  brendan gleeson  who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult . meanwhile  the police led by an inspector named kenny  jon voight  try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict  or kill  him .  br    br   perhaps because it  s a film in the same category as the marvelous  goodfellas        and the first two  godfather  films  i was expecting too much from  the general .  but that may be going too easy on it . this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far  too  stretched running time of screaming bad scenes . let  s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented . for some reason  director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black  and  white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full  fledged color film . now i have nothing against b  w pictures  not even ones made in modern  day times .  schindler  s list        was more than ninety percent filmed in black  and  white and it  s a masterpiece .  the general   made just five years after  schindler  s list  is not . the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video  game  like quality that i found simply annoying . the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist  s documentary  like style  like  schindler  s list  did  but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time  too much like a classic  style motion picture . performances in the film range from passable to poor . brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles  but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting . the sound design is also very primitive  probably in an attempt to give it a   s crime  noir appeal  but that also fails because again  it  s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place .  br    br   but the worst thing that occurs is that there  s not onenot onecharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for . in fact  for every moment of every scene  the only thought going through my head was  okayso what   moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time  consuming here . i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull . gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did . if a character is killed off  as they always are in gangster films   we feel nothing . no remorse  no relief  no surprise  nothing . we just say  so what   and that  s all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy  very poorly  made crime film .

0,i don  t want to go too far into detail  because i can  t really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film  but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring  pointless to extremely irritating . the humor was completely lost on the audience  and yes  ghost in the shell fans  this is not an action sci  fi or anything like that  its an attempt at slapstick comedy  and the humor just did not work after being translated . it was a total chore to watch this movie  and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest  especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything  i wasn  t expecting a ghost in the shell sequel  but i was expecting something entertaining  and it simply didn  t achieve this . yaaawwnnn . . . rent kino  s journey instead .  
0,i read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the     film noir   criss cross .  i found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film .  br    br   this movie is a  neo  noir  since it  s modern  day and it  s in color  two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status .  br    br   the biggest negative to it  however  wasn  t the cinematography  that was fine  but the muddled storyline . hey  some of    s dashiell hammett stories were similar but i didn  t care for some of those either . the filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes . no wonder it was the keep up with this story . it was ridiculous  what happens is that by the    minute mark  their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore . i know i didn  t .  
0,this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely . however the reason the movie is so predictable is that we  ve seen it all before . i  ve haven  t read the book a mother  s gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie . unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea  the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized .  
0,  flight of fury  is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring action film  i don  t expect a lot from a seagal film  all i expect is to be moderately entertained for   or so minutes with some mindless action  unfortunately this doesn  t even achieve that low expectation  the action scenes are few and far between  the plot  which is totally irrelevant in these films  is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout  the acting is truly abysmal  bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of  rd raters  i find it hard to believe that anything close to    m was spent on this dire mess unless    m of that   was seagal  s salary  i somehow doubt it  the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that  it  s mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b  movies i  ve endured  br    br        
0,after being hugely entertained by mr . brosnan  s performance as a cad in  the tailor of panama   which i rate      across the board casting  acting  script  story  editing  pace  music  emotional impact  etc .   i enthusiastically anticipated this film . i was hugely disappointed . it is a script reading not a film  vulgar for the sake of being vulgar  bankrupt in every way that  the tailor of panama  is rich and satisfying . blame it on the screen writing and directing . i sat in the theater waiting for the  good part  it never came . i neither laughed nor cried  although one line of dialog did make me smile . worth    hardly .  
0,i thought  intensive care  was quite bad and very unintentionally funny . but at least not as bad as i thought it might be . sometimes it  s somewhat suspenseful  but never a good shocker .  br    br   spoiler ahead  br    br   the fun lies in ridiculous moments . but the all  time classic moment is this peter  koen wauters  is stabbed and beaten by the killer . he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway . amy  nada van nie  kneels beside him and asks  poor peter  shall i get you a band  aid   .  br    br   this movie was shot in dutch and english . to spare costs  all license plates are usa  and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan . very funny if you  re dutch and watching the original version in dutch .  
1,i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy  i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business . . . who are now still trying to become adults . . . . no more fans  groupies  money etc . . . and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life . . . as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight . . . it is almost like they have to begin anew . . . this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the    s and    s are going through now . . . . and that  s where i find the film sad and depressing . but it portrays the life of an old rock star  abandoned and lost  in a believable way . the young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of hollis maclaren  outrageous  . . . and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . this film is a must have for folks in their    s who have seen the rise and fall of bands  people who knew the members  and have watched them hurt as age creeps in  and popularity fades . this is an almost perfect movie . . . . sad but in a way positive . . . . because of the whales . a must see   
0,after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp  who thought that a franchise could be born . sc ii is superior in aspect . more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun . while that might not be saying much  compared to the first movie   sleepaway camp ii is worth the rental .  br    br   pros entertaining  doesn  t take itself too seriously like sc i . inspired killings . cons crappy acting and mullets abound .  br    br   bottom line      br    br    
0,this film essentially deals with inspector gadget  s arch  nemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the now  peaceful city of metropolis . claw  s plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer  cooler  crimefighter to help destroy gadget  s popularity . sadly the film fails miserably  the series was great  but it was revived nearly   years later with tragic results . without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just doesn  t cut it anymore dr . claw is not only visually less frightening  but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold  than his original intimidating self . granted this is a children  s movie  but the plot is so painfully weak  heaven forbid i mention the animation  that it pales in comparison to the original series . someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed  she now has some quasi  punk rebellious clothing style and doesn  t play half the role that she did in the tv series . the gadgetmobile talks  as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars . maybe i  m just a kid who loved the show who  s grown up jaded  but i thought that the live  action version was more pain than i could bear  but now they go and spring this complete watering  down of the quality tv series on us . it  s more than i can take .  
0,this is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the west indies and it stars puddy from the  seinfeld  show  patrick warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he  s noticeably slimmer here . oliver reed got top billing but he  s hardly in the film at all . warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . eartha kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they  re is so much nudity in the film . if its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they  re turn with him . then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there  s the bloody standoff . no real political message like the film  burn  but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . incredibly they made a sequel and warburton and all the rest of the cast came back  i hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . the nudity keeps it watchable and warburton  s lack of any accent make it at times laughable . very bad film but i got to admit that i want to see the sequel .  
1,one of the best love stories i have ever seen . it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion  but lovely nonetheless . . . big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly  and are infinitely quotable  it  s a goddamned beautiful day  now will you just shut up   the opening explanation of little edie  s costume only promises that the movie will live on forever  and so will big edie  the world famous singer  and little edie  the world famous dancer .   
1,i do see what my forebears saw in the youthful bette davis . she  s splendid throughout this almost  madcap political comedy which actually stars warren williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony . vivienne osborne is brilliant as his ex  and i found myself rooting for her throughout . the williams character is not at all sympathetic  and he  s not even a decent op .  br    br   guy kibbee is one of the best at what he does . as a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated  so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the  progressive party .  if you  re of a political mind  you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional  progressive party  of williams and kibbee . i could draw exact parallels  but we  re not here for that .  br    br   this is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies . if you  ve ever watched any of the old wheeler  woolsey titles  half shot at sunrise  the rainmakers   you  ll find frank mchugh  as williams  s right arm  looking and behaving a lot like bert wheeler . he had me fooled .  br    br   yes  both my wife and i recommend this one .  
0,the author of the book  by the same title  should not have let her name be used for this movie . if you have read the book  this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details . the movie adds nothing  in terms of artistic merit  to the book  s own literary achievement .  br    br   for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed . not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace  it doesn  t offer anything more while it is moving slowly  like character development  for example  . some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie  but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle   its fairly tame and not imaginative at all .  
1,typical    s comedy  situational comedy similar to our modern day  my family  . thatcher being the height of most political jokes  bill  belinda lang  blames thatcher for anything she can .  bloody thatcher  possibly shared with most of us . david the typical teenager  cutting up brains with bread knives  jenny  the moody older teenage child  only interested in boys and more boys . bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family afloat struggling within the economical climate of the early    s . granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however  series  onwards is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count . overall this show didn  t get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer . clearly they couldn  t have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of  catherine tate   the office   little britain  and bring back the classics   
0,this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning  but never fleshed out to it  s expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas  typical of the asian directors   but doesn  t know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film  never finding a solid  explainable  interesting angle . basically  the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good  however . all the actors gave good performances  and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .  
1,a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan . he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good . the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake  centipede  scorpion  lizard  toad  while the last student was taught a little in each style . all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money  and soon everyone is battling to get the money .  br    br   classic martial arts film has title that even many non  fans know . i  ve spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head . its a very good movie  though i  m not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio  one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example  . this isn  t to sell the film short  its not  since the film is structured like a mystery  our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is . we  re given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is . the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film  other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money  there is really no action for about   or   minutes . its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention .  the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i  ve ever seen where there are no women . i don  t think one has a speaking role and i  m pretty sure that none appear in the background . its indicative of nothing  its just something that struck me .  this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles  but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch .  br    br   around  out of   .  
0,this is my first movie review on imdb . i was forced to register after watching this movie . i cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me . the people must be warned   br    br   first of all  my rating is   as in  zero    br    br   i love jack black  ben stiller  rachel weis  and christopher walken  and yet  i hated this movie . there is a plot  but who cares when there  s no script . the dialogue is unreal and plain boring  the situations are contrived  the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary  the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting  and the story  although based on a good premise  is stupid . this movie is a piece of poo .  br    br   never mind wasting money on this movie  it  s not even worth your time spent watching it . please do not see it . . . i beg of you   
1,also known as  water lilies  this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex . this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well . it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them .  br    br   using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well . everyone is completely believable . visual setting is great  especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect .  br    br   many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them . it pulls some  standard  pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them . it isn  t bad  not at all  but it surely isn  t great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles .  br    br    out of   synchronous swimmers  
0,this british pot  boiler has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking . the older men are opinionated  right  wing thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the reagan  thatcher years . young or old  however  morals in this three  part mini  series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well .  br    br   nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of oxford . it is not pivotal to the story  but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier . nick comes to london with a friend  whose father gerald is a rich conservative politician  and babysits his sister cat while the family frolics in the south of france . they neglect to inform him that  when upset  cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements . nick mistakes their self  serving  gratitude  for affection and moves in  finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him . inexplicably  nick lives in this house for four years but  as the plot depends on this point  it  s best not to question it .  br    br   while nick is most pleasing to look at  he is unbearably obsequious . his coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls . deeply closeted except to cat  she guesses his big secret on sight   he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay . though it hardly seems possible  nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he .  br    br   supercilious tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film  so imagine the venom which spews forth when nick  s sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid . gerald  in true tory fashion  has become involved in several personal and financial scandals  so the revelations about nick add to his embarrassment . this gives gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy .  br    br   except for one brief moment of indignation  nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement . denial  self  loathing  naivet  or ignorance  you decide  if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set .  
1,the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in     and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin .  br    br   the main protagonist  antagonist jennifer stanton  hart  is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father  baldwin  . however  when she meets an ex con called nick ryan  jeremy jordan  never been kissed   they instantly  fall  for each other  but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship . she manipulates him to kill her parents  to protect their  love  but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad  david lascher future  sabrina  cast mate for hart  . melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder . the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time . i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year  hart  began portrayed sabrina  the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television .  br    br   although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to  nine dead  that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called  clarissa darling  or sabrina spellman   br    br   i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina . you can watch this on the internet  so i suggest check it out .  
1,there are so many good things to say about this b movie .  br    br   b  maybe in connections  but not in commission . this is about the best of its genre that i have ever seen . a grade a effort by universal . the script is well done  imaginative  and without fault . writing credits howard higgin original story  douglas hodges story  john colton  screenplay  . director lambert hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well . no skimping on the loads of extras and locations . i loved beulah bondy  jimmy stewarts mother in it  s a wonderful life . the fem lead  frances drake is a beauty and handled her part with grace and pathos for her karloff husband . lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed . i think this is the best part i remember seeing him in . as i said there were so many good things the african discovery of the radium x  the melting of the stone statues   somewhat reminiscent of the ten little indians in and then there were none  agatha christie   the barry fitzgerald version    the glowing of karlof in the dark . karloff  s mother played by violet kemble cooper with elegance . and because of all these virtues  i found myself believing in the science it portrayed . i guess that  s the mark of a good piece of art .

1,ok  i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i don  t know why . i haven  t seen it since  but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film  again i don  t know why . but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes .  br    br   comedy is hard  much harder than any drama . doing it right makes it seem easy  but doing it wrong . . . is there anything worse than a bad comedy  steve martin  pay attention  you are falling in this category again for some reason .  br    br   elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly . done at a quick pace  with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn  t the philedelphia story  it entertains from start to finish . brain donors is another that fits right in this category  sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes  .  br    br   one point of contention  the ending . it seems the writers  director had no idea how to finish a comedy . the ending tries to be a love story  somewhat undermining the quirky fast  paced dialogue up to that point . then there is the  tassle  scene . whereas this has to be seen  male opinion   it is so over the top and out of place it  s like a shock . one more rewrite for the ending was needed .  br    br   this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail . but if you don  t try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you  you  ll laugh  i guarantee it .  
1,thought at first this film would be your typical western film  however  it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end  which turned out very unusual . charlton heston   sam burgade    midway       had past experiences with james coburn   zach provo    deadfall       and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back . unfortunately  barbara hershey   susan burgade    the portrait of a lady       managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone . sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion . this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding .  
0,i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it . the movie  however  did not meet my expectations . having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . the characters didn  t seem to fit very well with the book . the direction was weak . i had a hard time getting into the characters . there wasn  t a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . the dialog didn  t explain adequately what was happening . it just seemed slapped together and rushed through . all in all i was very disappointed with the movie . i suppose if you haven  t read the book  it might be ok by itself . at the very least  it might entice you to read the book  which you  ll probably enjoy more .  br    br    
1,this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave . it even surpasses his wonderful performance as  johnny eager  coming a full   years after that film . his looks are still a wonder to see  but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty  violent role . charlie gilson  taylor  is the last of his breed  a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure . his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings  is stunning to watch . he is basically a lonely man  needing the people around him  but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior . his partner is sandy mckenzie  stewart granger  who is sick of the hunt  and only goes along  because he is a failure at anything else . along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra pagent . charlie tries to seduce her to no avail  but sees that sandy is interested in her also . granger is kind of sad to watch  so fed up with the hunt  longing to go away with the girl and her baby . lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing . russ tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world . the group is an odd mix of good and evil  young and old . in the end taylor gets spooked by the buffalo  as many hunters before him had  and runs off leaving sandy with the girl . upon his return  that night sandy leaves with the woman  setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself . the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it . it is taylor  s film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era .  
0,visually interesting  but falls flat in the originality department . this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle . jude law has the charisma of burnt toast  but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen . in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film  and had me thinking about work  bills  my dogs  etc . there are many moments that scream bluescreen . paltrow is as wooden as they get . this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp . my only complaint on the technique is that black  white film  sorry  computer  would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white . just a big dull clich mess . i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again .  
1,this is a very funny movie  easy to watch  that entertains you almost all the time . the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark . the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon  but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort . the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz  played by luque  on his assignments while he also assist him  diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him  . some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide understandable and laughable anywhere . is very good overall  it would deserved an   but i rated  because it gets a little down at the end . on a personal remark i must add that is a  bravo  for argentinian filmmakers  considering the little good is coming lately .  
1,i love the doodlebops . my son has been watching them for over a year . we went to the doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday  connecticut  . he loves them . the doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares  are you being serious  the tv isn  t suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet . the parents should . get over it . the doodlebops actually can sing . deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all  of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing . imagine  they dance  jump around and still sing . they have talent  the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show . this show is by far the best show on tv for kids . and a rock band for children . how amazing is that  why are people saying chad  rooney  is gay  where did you hear that from  whether he is or not  he is awesome  leave him alone . its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children   
0,i  ve seen many horror shows over the years  like nightstalker  that dealt with the wendigo legend  so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season . man was i mistaken . the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy  but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property . ve  ery scary  not  this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor  another total loser .  br    br   it  s getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies  since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore . what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made  go back to the drawing board fellas  and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around .  
1,as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age  this film is without parallel . it is  quite simply  brilliant . full marks to everyone  from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product . you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers .  
0,this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad . . . hence  can i advice anyone to watch it  well  i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition  i still can  t believe it won  . . and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a qa section . . but that was also anything but interesting . . what  s it about  well the first half  the worth watching one  presents three characters a hooker  a musician and some kind of official . . the first two lie about their professions . . but the third is the actual liar . . the second half  do something else . . don  t ruin a good evening  includes some old breasts and heavy drinking . . but maybe you will see it completely different . . . the tiff jury did  were they drinking vodka    
0,i am definitely a burt reynolds fan  but sorry  this one really stinks . most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie . i can  t believe he even made this one . is he actually that hard up for money   
1,actually  goldie hawn is from washington  takoma park  maryland   but i digress . this is sort of a mr . smith goes to washington type of movie  with some variations but the same premise . i taped this movie off of cable years ago because i had a huge crush on goldie hawn . the story is interesting  but it  s highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot  s life . it made me laugh and made me mad at the same time . it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous  i had to laugh .  possible spoiler ahead  . it made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up . and the speech she made at the end . . . beautiful . too bad not many people have guts like that in real life .  
1,i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent .  br    br   new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever  funny  and sometimes shocking situations around the human race  s most powerful emotion .  br    br   the cast is huge  a veritable oceans   with andy garcia  ethan hawke  shia labouf  natalie portman  bradley cooper and others . they all give stand out performances in one way or another .  br    br   that  s not to mention that there is a who  s who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways . brett rattner  shaka kapur  natalie portman  i mean  wow  this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny . it also has serious stories and notes . but that  s good in my opinion . go see it for yourself and reply to my review  i want to hear what others have to say .  
1,successful self  made married businessman harry mitchell  a superbly steely performance by roy scheider  has an adulteress fling with sweet  n  sexy young stripper cini  the gorgeous kelly preston  . harry  s blackmailed by a trio of scummy low  life hoods   sleazy porno theater manager raimy  a splendidly slimy john glover   antsy strip joint owner leo  well played by robert trebor  and crazed pimp bobby shy  a frightfully intense clarence williams iii    who have videotaped his affair with cini . when harry refuses to pay up  the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it . this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods . director john frankenheimer  adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard  s gritty crime thriller novel  expertly maintains a steady snappy pace  delivers plenty of gripping tension  and effectively creates a compellingly seedy  n  sordid atmosphere . the leads are all uniformly excellent  with stand  out supporting turns by ann  margret as harry  s bitter neglected wife barbara  vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen  and lonny chapman as harry  s loyal business partner jim o  boyle . the tight  n  twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout . the wickedly profane dialogue  jost vacano  s glossy cinematography  gary chang  s stirring score  the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well . as an added bonus  both vanity and preston take their clothes off . a very strong and satisfying little number that  s well worth checking out .  
1,in watching this early demille work  it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille . his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable . his pacing is very good  enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so . it is a pity that he wasn  t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films .  br    br   this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely . she was remarkable  quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions .  br    br   the ending is wonderful .  
0,i just saw adam had four sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that i believe that the model used was theodore roosevelt and his four sons . they were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film . warner baxter in his portrayal of adam stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our   th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of tr  s character .  br    br   like tr all of the stoddard sons serve in world war i  in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed .  br    br   but what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things  that  s susan hayward  s job here . in one of her earliest prominent roles  hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son  has an affair with another  and starts making a play for the third . it  s an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an oscar in i want to live .  br    br   i suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as theodore roosevelt was and warner baxter portrays  everyone is afraid to tell father what  s going on . the sons and also their governess ingrid bergman . here  s where the plot gets a little silly . bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by baxter and wife fay wray for their kids . wray dies and baxter suffers some financial reversals in business . bergman has to be let go . she goes back to france and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up .  br    br   i  m sorry  but i can  t believe the kids need a governess now . hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it wasn  t the kids who brought her back . in the normal course of things  bergman would have gotten on with her life .  br    br   one of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film i have was edited out . possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have .  br    br   it  s too bad that ingrid and susan could not have done another film together in the fifties when hayward was at her heights and bergman had just made a comeback .  br    br   susan hayward is the main reason to see adam had four sons . and i  m willing to believe that a good deal of ingrid was left on the cutting room floor .  
0,wow  i can  t believe people consider this a  good  movie . now  i have seen much worse  but there are much more romantic  funny comedies with john cusack .  br    br   this is a mediocre film at best . while the acting wasn  t terrible  but not great  for a romantic comedy  there was little passion  little romance . there were many loose ends that don  t show up or are not addressed . unfortunately  the main characters do come off as complete cowards . they don  t know themselves well enough to realize that they don  t love the people they are engaged to . how do we know they aren  t in love  by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances . i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show .  br    br   the movie doesn  t even end with a wedding scene  more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing . this movie is really about two people who can  t commit to anything  unlike cusack  s previous characters  who were more than willing to make a deep commitment  loyd in say anything  martin in grosse pointe blank  etc .  .  br    br   the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns  or anything of interest . when the movie ended  i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story  which basically fits the whole movie boring . no suspense about whether the two will end up together  no joy when they do  no consequences to their actions .  br    br   it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie  that they simply rebuke any criticism with  everyone is too cynical   . criticism of this movie is not cynicism  simply unbiased examination . there are many other better romantic comedies  even ones with grace kelly  or eva marie saint .  br    br   if you think this movie is great  try these movies  you hearts will explode the princess bride  say anything  grosse pointe blank  high fidelity  keeping the faith  charade  rear window  north by northwest  or there  s something about mary  which is a good examination of idealized romance vs . today  s society  .  
0,  fly me to the moon  has to be the worst animated film i  ve seen in a long time . that  s saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last  years now . the story is to be generous . . . trite . the voice acting is atrocious  too cute sounding . the humor is of the romper room variety . the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television .  br    br   it gets a  only because of it  s ok   d visuals . some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we  ve seen much better in the past . i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes . while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the  rd or  th time . it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators .  br    br   i will say this though  it had a pretty cool soundtrack . and for the record my son wasn  t too crazy about it either . bad movie .  
0,this movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what  being from and growing up in wichita kansasi know for a fact    of the movie was bogus . aside from the names of some of the victims  nothing else much was correct . the movie looks like it was made with dad  s handy  cam  it had footage that i believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house . i usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it  but due to the bad acting  poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending . it was a struggle to watch it through to the ending . i recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry . crunch  
1,greta garbo  s american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions  as in a torrent  causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way .  br    br   greta plays leonora  a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez  s character don rafael  a landowner . ricardo is in love with her too  but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother . leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris  where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman . in reality  part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael  s abandonment .  br    br   she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael . surprisingly  no one knows that she  s the famous la brunna  and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals .  br    br   ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part  and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm  though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right . he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama  s boy  and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie . he fails to win leonora when she returns home  and later when he follows her  his courage is undermined .  br    br   this movie is beautifully shot  with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking . there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield  tully marshall  and mack swain .  br    br   although this is a story of lost love and missed chances  i don  t think leonora and rafael would have been happy together  as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman  and i don  t think would have been happy in a small village . the ending is true to life and pulls no punches .  br    br   see this one as garbo  s american film debut and a precursor of things to come  
0,what the hell is in your minds  this film sucks  each minute i was getting more and more bored . i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen  but instead of that  i got amazed how dull the end was treated . . . what is this story about this bloody  bogeyman   how comes he doesn  t die  he is a bloody human being for god  s sake  a mere boy that killed his silly sister   years ago . then what  his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal  this film a fascinatingly stupid . . . it  s a must of silliness . i  m gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film .  
0,slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic   s slasher flick . a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt . a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him . now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining  but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the   s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors .  br    br   the acting is horrendous  however  actually not as bad as one would suspect . though it doesn  t help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable . the lead  carol manning  caroline munro  is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she  s the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for . not to mention  the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his  so when he gets mauled  does anyone really care   br    br   there is much unintentional laughter potential . munro  s lack of acting talent is quite apparent  which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast . however  the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro  who is in her mid   s at the time  as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers . and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age  the rest of the cast do not pass as adults . this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking  i  ll get you .  with that being said  slaughter high really isn  t a very good slasher flick  but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it . perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans  but don  t expect dilemma  suspense  or any credibility from it . horrible     
0,truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen . . . . ever .  br    br   they tried to make up for it by giving it the   we know we are doing this  routine . that would have been funny if it weren  t for the fact that  the simpsons  had already done it . and it still wouldn  t make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place .  br    br   the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character  s  mainly j . d  s  fantasies . the flashbacks weren  t even of actual events that occurred  just compilations of say  j . d falling over or  i don  t know . . . . elliott falling over . if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i  d go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life .  br    br   scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit  coms have to  and it disappoints me  they managed to go  and a quarter seasons without an episode like this .  br    br   i was hoping that scrubs wouldn  t have to be that kind of sit  com .  br    br   and just as a passing thought  why the hell was dr . cox bald   
0, review may contain some spoilers  i  ll make this review short and sweet . i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman . how bad could it be  right  well  it  s pretty bad . justin timberlake plays pollack  a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison  s police force . ll cool j is deed  a cop within the force on a special force team called f . r . a . t .  first response assault tactics  . he  s teamed with an  on  the  edge  bad cop named lazerov  dylan mcdermott  . in the opening scene we see lazerov  deed taking on some bank robbers  but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . i don  t want to give to much away  but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . pollack  who works for ashford  morgan freeman  goes to a trial involving deeds  lazerov . he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford  does some investigate that turns ugly . wallace  kevin spacey  who is all within the f . r . a . t . team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice .  br    br   you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey  s performance are pretty lackluster . the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott . he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . ll cool j is terrible in this film . he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . he was much better in movies like deep blue sea  any given sunday . the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . the ending is far from satisfying .  br    br   don  t waste your time with this film . i  m putting it on ebay this weekend .

0,this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far  among more than    french movies i have ever seen . terrible screenplay and very medioacre  unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless . with all that it doesn  t matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story .  br    br   one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people  as an audience i don  t care what happens to them .  br    br   it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes  man  i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes  but not this one . a major disappointment for me .  
1,the ship may have sunk but the movie didn  t    director  james cameron  from  the terminator  did it again with this amazing picture . one of my favorite scenes is  the dinner table  scene  in which rose  s family and friends meet jack after he saves her . rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet  the one  . . . i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband .  br    br   jack and rose have a connection that is  movie stuff  but it  s good movie stuff . we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth . rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her . i really liked the hanging over the boat scene . it was a good risk .  br    br   the movie is long but it  s fantastic    good story  good flow  good actors    go see it twice if you want  its worth it     
0,watched on hulu  far too many commercials   so it broke the pacing but even still  it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties . dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis . if i were indian  i  d protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews . they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment  especially for a modern indian film . the story doesn  t take place in india  the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india  but i can  t find out where it is supposed to be happening .  
0,this film has the kernel of a really good story . the work of the men and women of the coast guard  especially in the north pacific  is the stuff of heroes and legends . this film mucks up a good story with three endings  none satisfying   a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged  romantic  relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire . the rescue scenes are great  even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal  but the backstory is lame and disappointing . costner is good  especially his hand acting  watch for it  . ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible . the main female characters are one dimensional . the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and she  s on camera for about two minutes in the whole film . it could have been an excellent film  and costner needs one   
1,sometimes i just want to laugh . don  t you  no analyzing  no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning . rent this movie  watch it all and laugh your ass off . don  t want to admit you liked it  fine . but don  t trash it here when you and i both know you liked it . it  s damn funny   
0,i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments . it  s not a bad movie exactly  but it  s one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre . plus  it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways  and the characters  behavior often strains belief . i  d say its a film that you would get something out of if you don  t have a lot of film  tv  literature  life behind you  to be honest  i  ve seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even  . otherwise  its point has been made before and more artfully . and that gets to the big problem  which is that it really doesn  t have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point . it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling  and it doesn  t really pay off .  
1,about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors . i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn  t try to find it anywhere . then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought  hey why not  and tried finding it on the internet . eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films . i called my dad over to the computer and said to him  hey dad i  ve found that creepy film you told me about ages ago   he smiled at me  turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it . i started off fine . . . then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving . at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up . . . it made me jump  p if you haven  t seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it . even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling .  br    br   great film   
0,i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy  i know i wouldn  t have the nerve to go even  feet away from a croc .  br    br   but  everything in this movie is bad . farting jokes  people getting eaten  and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time .  br    br   it  s a really bad film that you have to stay away from . all the  jokes  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid . the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is  years old .  br    br   i  m surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .  
1,when i think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure  type movies  the first thing i think of are    s slasher flicks . really bad slasher flicks . the formulaic type of film  where all a script needed was  parts blood and several parts nudity to get made .  br    br   flash forward to the late    s  early    s . the slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of      s  scream  . like in the    s  these films were formulaic  masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as  hip  tongue  in  cheek parodies  of the original slasher flicks . of this recent blend of  hip parody  neo  slasher flicks  the only one worth seeing is the low  budget  direct  to  video  cut  .  br    br   like most of the other  new  slasher flicks   cut  relies on the production of a slasher flick  in this case a fictional     film  hot blooded   to make its commentary on the genre .  hot blooded  never finished production  because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film  s killer  scarman  a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark  pupil  less eyes . now    years later  a group of film students  whose professor was involved in the production  have decided to go into the vaults  tap the original surviving actress  and finish the film . but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot   scarman  returns and someone dies . to quote the tagline  will they finish the film before it finishes them   br    br   this all sounds really bad  and to a degree it is  really  is there such a thing as a good slasher flick   . there is no character development  the  new  director is revealed to be the daughter of  hot blooded   s original director  whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would  ve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot  yet it  s never mentioned again  and  like in all other slasher flicks  there are just too many bodies to care about . the actors aren  t great  even by direct  to  video standards  but most are having fun with their characters  and for those who aren  t  it  s inadvertent character acting  since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on  hot blooded    particularly whoever was lucky enough to play scarman .  cut   s climax has no big  who dunnit  unmasking of the killer like in the  scream  films . it doesn  t have the gimmick killings of the  urban legend  films . what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a  this way we can write a sequel if it sells well  ending . but that  s par for the course .  br    br   by any sensible viewing standards  this is a horrible movie that should be avoided  but this  quality  is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre  and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo  slasher flicks .  
1,this is a bad movie in the traditional sense  but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good . very funny and well made  although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste  what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so on .  
1,this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments . i loved the character of matt  and also tiny . they seemed the most engaging and funny characters  and certainly the most interesting . matt is very good  as is his no good cousin   and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy . i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor  eric bana . my personal favourite part was the brothel scene  loved that . overall  i liked the film and it  ll get about an  rating . the penalty however  i was disappointed in . it was a side foot curl  rather than the appropriate laces blast .  br    br   i am of course kidding .    
0,i can  t tell you how angry i was after seing this movie . the characters are not the slightest bit interesting  and the plot is non  existant . so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other  hoping that the past  and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish  what do we get    a storm of frogs . now yes  i understand the references to the bible  exodus  and the underlying theme  but first of all  it was presented with absolutely no resolution  and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible  a significant portion of the population  or charles fort  a still larger portion  . as a somewhat well read person  i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode .  br    br   don  t waste your time . it would be better spent reading . . .  br    br   . . . well anything to be honest  
0,so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater . as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic  tear  jerking barbra streisand film something like the way we were . i was certainly wrong . the chemistry between the two main characters  esther hoffman and her john howard  was nonexistent  making it impossible to get attached to the characters . there wasn  t anything romantic about it . streisand  s character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn  t sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast  forward button . at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later . there  s nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can  t seem to realize it until he actually dies . parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on  and i kept asking myself when it was going to end .  br    br   the death of john howard was completely predictable . there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie  and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever . it wasn  t a tragic accident  it was him basically being an idiot . not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard .  br    br   the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs . the ending of the movie when she sings  with one more look at you  watch closely now  was my reason for giving this film a whopping     . those  minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger .  
1,in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel  ian mcshane   his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop . meanwhile the deceased joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of london . he cheats the reaper and appears to the american student of journalism sondra pransky  scarlett johansson   who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician sidney waterman  woody allen  in london  and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat peter lyman  hugh jackman  . sondra drags sid in her investigation  seeking for evidences that peter is the killer . however  she falls in love with him and questions if joe strombel is right in his scoop .  br    br    scoop  is another great woody allen  s comedy outside manhattan  actually again in london . his ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic  and i laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive  in the wrong side  . sid waterman is extremely funny and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian . however  his present muse scarlett johansson  of whom i am a big fan  has over  acting and is annoying in many moments  changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation . her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous  and i was quite disappointed with her performance  probably for the first time in her filmography  . but this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment . my vote is eight .  br    br   title  brazil    scoop  o grande furo    scoop  the big scoop    
0,were i not with friends  and so cheap  i would have walked out . it failed miserably as satire and didn  t even have the redemption of camp .  
0,difficult to call the grudge a horror movie . at best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments .  br    br   if one forgets the  failed  frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie  he is again disappointed . the acting is ok but not great . the story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning  while one is trying to get what  s happening . but toward the end one understands there is not much to understand .  scary  elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason . . .  br    br   so . . .  yawn  see this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do  like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .  
1,i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona . this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story . if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy bw movies then you  re sure to get a kick out of this rendition . the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it  s meant to be . i personally find madonna  s musical element to be a major part of this film  the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i  ve listened to often over the years  it  s just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era . in my mind  madonna  s finest moment both on  screen but especially musically . this is sure to bring out the  kid  in you .  
1,i  ve always liked johnny concho and i wish this film were out on vhs and dvd . frank sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one .  br    br   when we first meet frank in the film  s title role  he  s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who  s out of town at the moment . the brother strikes terror in the heart  s of the town and frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow . only phyllis kirk has any feeling for him . she  s the daughter of storekeeper wallace ford and dorothy adams .  br    br   two other gunmen arrive william conrad and christopher dark and it turns out conrad has killed sinatra  s brother and he  s coming to his town to take over . they humiliate sinatra and run him out of town . kirk follows him .  br    br   overnight sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone . it  s a well acted performance  almost as good as his oscar nominated role in the man with a golden arm . pity for some reason this has not been seen for years .  br    br   two other performances of note are keenan wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps sinatra find what he needs to stand up to conrad and dark . and then there is conrad in what i believe was his career role on screen . he  s a villain of incredible malevolence  pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen .  br    br   however what i like about johnny concho is the climax an unforgettable one where conrad and dark are dealt with . let  s just say i believe johnny concho was mgm  s answer to high noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order .  
0,may contain spoilers  br    br   the titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father  an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next  from a moth  eaten  dime  store mummy and nasty nazis out to   what else    build a fourth reich . misty  s costume  like those of some other wimmen  gets skimpier as the movie rolls on . the last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action this footage actually gets real boring  real fast  which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it . misty gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast  then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft  core sex . this makes mummy raider a throwback to movies made in the     s by guys like stan borden  david f . friedman and harry novak . just think if this wonder  work had been cranked out four decades ago  it would have played for years on   nd street along with wham bam thank you spaceman and kiss me quick . as it is  misty mundae mummy raider went straight to home video . grab yours  quick  before it goes out of print .  
0,okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a        budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed  plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn  t you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her  and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her  proof  . i don  t know i was not happy with the ending . this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad  do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy .  
1,this was a favorite of my childhood  i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i  m grown up and have a kid of my own  i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday  and he liked it . during abu  s fight with the giant spider  my son  s hand crept over and took hold of mine  he was genuinely scared .  is he gonna beat the spider  poppa   just watch  you  ll see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of  eight years old   so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al  raschid might as well be oz under ozma .  br    br   i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring  do were perpetrated by the boy  thief  and not the grown  up king . in fact  if you deconstruct the film  s narrative a bit  the king is the thief  s sidekick  not the hero at all  which must be very satisfying to imaginative  adventurous young boys .  br    br   it  s definitely a period piece  i suspect that by the time he  s eleven or twelve  my son will find it  corny  or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one  dimensional  as a cynical friend commented   why does ahmad love the princess  because the narrative demands it .  the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy  repeatedly  for the clueless  love  struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses  fifty  foot genies and the temple of the all  seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie  s climax is tremendous  as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his  stolen  magic carpet  seeking  some fun  and adventure at last    
0,this movie was made for fans of dani  and cradle of filth  . i am not one of them . i think he  s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon  still  i  m generally not a fan of black metal  . but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it  i convinced myself  that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing . thus i assumed i  m in for a roller  coaster ride of rubber gore and do  it  yourself splatter with a sinister background . now  that is what i do like .  br    br   i got home and popped it in . my patience lasted   minutes . awful camera work and disgusting quality . and that was then        that it looked like it was shot using a hi  camcorder . i left it on the shelf . maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this . . . picture .  br    br   after a couple of months i got back to it  in mentioned surroundings  and saw half . then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me . my disliking evolved . i noticed how funny dani      m     height  looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart .  yes  ripping . his head apparently had no skull .  i also found that this movie may have no sense . still  i haven  t finished it yet  so i wasn  t positive .  br    br   after a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick  a couple of months back . . .  yes  it took me    years .  so  dani in fact was funny as satan  manson  super  evil  man  s helper and the movie did not make sense . see our bad person employs dani to do bad things . he delivers . why  well i guess he  s just very  very bad . as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it .  br    br   we have a couple of short stories joined by dani  s character . my favourite was about a guy  who steals someone  s leg  because he wants to use it as his own . yeah  exactly .  br    br   the acting  s rock bottom . the cgi is the worst ever . i mean stinger beats it  and  boy  is stinger  s cgi baaaaad  . the story has no sense . and the quality is . . . let  s just say it is not satisfying . the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore . blood and guts are made pretty well . why  you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on .  example  dani  the man  filth takes a stuffed cat  fake as can be  and guts it . . . and then eats what fell out . why  we never know . we do know  however  that this cat must have been on illegal substances  as his heart is almost half his size .   br    br   you might think  after my comment that this movie is so bad it  s good  but it  s just bad . cradle of filth fans can add  points . i added one for gore .  
0,i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre  an art  house theatre  no less   but couldn  t make it there in the one whole week it played  but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and . . . well . . . i wasn  t disappointed  that  s for sure  madonna has done it again yet another bomb  when will this woman learn  when will the studios learn   or perhaps they already have  since this film was largely dumped  with little fanfare and deadly word  of  mouth .  one would hope that being directed by her talented husband  who  s created some interesting and  or terribly entertaining work  would bring out the same quality madonna showed in  desperately seeking susan   alas  it just isn  t meant to be  for here she is  at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness  the smugness permeating every frame she  s in  made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux  british accent  an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant . this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman  and look at her films of  say  the past decade like a latter  day bette davis  there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body  which here  despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film  perhaps its only saving grace   are done no favors . to her credit  the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world  s greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess . no one involved escapes unharmed bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on  screen  though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she  s actually in something good  which had me thinking all the while   denial ain  t just a river in egypt   adriano giannini  son of giancarlo giannini  star of the italian original   swept away . . .   is  like his father before him  immensely attractive  and isn  t altogether bad  despite winning a razzie nomination for  worst actor    but  like almost everything else about this production  it all comes back to madonna  on whose shoulders rest the blame . why her  why not her husband  director guy ritchie  just who do you think was behind this remake  what actress wouldn  t want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her  with only a relative nobody sharing the screen  oh sure  ritchie deserves some blame surely he  or someone  anyone   should have  and could have  taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings  for her performance is so wooden it  s a surprise the rest of the cast didn  t get splinters   or at least display a semblance of warmth . . . but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole . above and beyond anything else  this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it . a film like this  an  odd couple   ish  war of the classes  should be light and fun  with leads who can bounce off one another with witty  even romantic  dialogue  for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded  really be  honestly  i don  t think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy  i defy you to laugh even once  or romance  madonna  s ice  princess routine precludes any chemistry  . it  s not even bad enough for us bad  movie lovers to enjoy . a real shame . . .  
1,my cable tv has what  s called the arts channel  which is a  catch  as  catch  can  situation sometimes  sometimes films  sometimes short clips of films or ballets  and i came into this just as the bar scene came on  where they tear up their coupons . excellent  exquisite  ealing wins again  my wartime  glasgow  raised mother would love this  should i ever find a copy of it . some of britain  s best artists  from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford  having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office . loved the last scene  where as soon as they are  back in england   the temperature plummets and it rains . . .  
0,is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant  life  spanning testimonial of  spring  summer  fall  winter and spring   the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite  nearly silent  heartbreaking longing of   iron   the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of  the coast guard  and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all  characters and viewers alike  to experience redemption in  samaritan girl   i just cannot seem to find him in this film .  br    br   oh  sure  kim  s nature motif is still present . the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters . yes  it  s kim ki duk  all right . kim even describes the film as  beautiful  in an interview included in the dvd  s special features . but i  m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation .  br    br   what is beautiful about angry  potty  mouthed prostitutes  lustful  violent and potty  mouthed fishermen  a covetous mute merchant  explicit animal torture  sequences of self  mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality  these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film . if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater  this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material . it has been favorably compared to  audition  by japanese director takashi miike  much to kim  s satisfaction   but aside from some astonishingly good performances  especially given what they had to work with  by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk  i find little reason to recommend this film . i have not seen  audition   but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of  the isle .  its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic . its sex is not pornographic  but passionless and masochistic . characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot . its point is either non  existent or  i will admit  lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand .  br    br   the only beauty is in the cinematography  which is classic kim fog  shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake  mountainous terrain dominating the background  and an imaginative and playful use of color . at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room . some touches  like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes  are intriguing . but as a film  this effort is downright confusing and  in the end  offensive to the senses  not necessarily to sensibilities . one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film  making in the trash heap of his past  for we know he is capable of so much more .  
0,warning this review contains minor spoilers .  br    br   well the writers of the first tremors are officially out of ideas . i  m a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare . tremors   the legends begins  however  is a very dull movie . where the heck are the graboids     br    br   due to the relative lack of graboids through the first   minutes i  m convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a  character study  . unfortunately there isn  t one interesting character in the movie except for billy drago  s character who is given too few lines  too little to do and in the end too little screen time . what saved the  nd and  rd movies was the presence of michael gross as burt gummer . whenever there wasn  t any action on the screen you could rest assured that burt gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and  or watch . however in this movie gross plays hiram gummer a very poor and boring substitute .  br    br   on the plus side when the graboids  dirt dragons in this movie  are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets .  br    br   i was impressed when i saw that tremors  was listed at    minutes long . pretty good for straight to video . but after watching it i  m sure that this movie is a good   minutes too long . there are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and doesn  t further the plot any . was there a rush to get this movie made  i think not  more time could have and should have been spent on the script .  br    br   i thought i had hit a gold mine when i saw tremors  packaged for sale with . . . . tremors    what luck i thought  pay for   get   for free . well after watching tremors  i like to think i paid for the original and got this mess for free  i can  t imagine paying a single dime for tremors  . for fans of the series it  s best to forget that tremors   the legend begins even exists .  br    br   tremors   the legend begins rates a  out of   .  
0,i wouldn  t say this totally sucked  but if it wasn  t for netflix i wouldn  t even have this in my house . steve martin  s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat . he  s just not funny . he  s another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie . the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original . amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a  minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately . the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes . the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn  t get pregnant . the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts  but it seems to simple simmer along  not really entertaining or creating laughs .  
1,the japanese  run lola run   his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone  s face . fans of run lola run  tampopo  go   and slacker will probably like this one . it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate  seemingly unrelated vignettes  all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways . catch it if you see it  otherwise wait for the rental .  
1,good show  very entertaining . good marshal arts acting . good story plot . the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich  to chuck  norris  jennifer tung  and especially a big hand to judson mills . an especially fine tribute to robert urich  in his latter days . a great  actor who will be truly missed .  
1,i just thought it was excellent and i still do . i  m grateful we  re still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with . saving grace is smart and enjoyable  those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america  s bride sort of movie .  br    br   saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn  t have to be stupid . i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband  s debts .  br    br   in a nutshell  a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing . you couldn  t ask for more .  br    br       .  
1,rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film . a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we  ve loved and lost . although  only   minutes long  griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time . bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will  a widower struggling to cope with his wife  s death . will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ruth  s pet cow  tulip . the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost . good cinematography  great direction  and superbly acted . it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one  and survived .  
0,well  they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied . i don  t know if stella james  sean young  qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac  but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men . she  s still exploring  trying to find  more data  so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it  though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now .  i can  t agree  however  with anyone who says young is too old for the role . if she is  we should all age so nicely .  for the most part this film left me cold  though it  s by no means the worst of its type you  ll ever see . and unlike the recent  eyes wide shut   at least something happens in this one .

0,this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do . the original kicked some major tire squealing butt  this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films  which is we all know they suck  but they have great action . this film has no action . this film is boring . where are the cars  where are the chases  where  s the tension  where  s the suspense  where  s the rush  where     this isn  t really a movie at all  it  s a bad commercial .   cars in   hours  that is wrong . they have  days to steal them  the ad is wrong . how bad is that  the leads acting is stiff  wooden and forced . the villain  the cop  the others . . . who cares . they utter their pointless lines  they serve the illogical plot . they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says  don  t worry we  ll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is  or  we  ll fix it with lots of loud music  the  script  isn  t really a script at all  it  s more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of        warning  possible spoiler                                       the fugitive . the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones  man . . . . this is the baddest  coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction . and what do they do   they make him a mute who  s hardly in the film  make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film . how could they have been so dumb  how  how  why  the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away . the original has a great   minute chase that delivers  go find the original . or if you  re craving some real car chase action go rent ronin . the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged . bruckheimer and cage had all that money  all those resources  all that experience  and they can  t even come close to matching a film made   years ago for          how can that be  you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie . where i was once excited to see coyote ugly  remember the titans and pearl harbor  now i say god help us all .  br    br    
0,i discovered this movie with a retailer selling oop  s . and this one surely is an oop . one year after the exorcist she  s back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out  she never became a mega star . that  s one of the reason  s many of her films are oop . she gives a good performance in this movie . it  s about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn  t have any friends . played at an age of   playing a girl of    that  s funny . the movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity . in most editions it  s cut out  why  i don  t know  no blood is involved  okay  blair is butt naked but nothing is shown  no ta so nothing to offend people . but the movie is slow  extremely slow . it doesn  t happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep . it  s just about that   year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows  no gore no nothing . why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me . if you  re a fan of blair  buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is .  
0,final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas  shooting people who shoot people . then he  s off to malta where he shoots more people . he gets locked up many times for shooting people . then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy  who is dressed like a monk . there is a boat chase  and joe don winds up in jail again . finally joe don  with the help from elaine from  seinfeld  kill the bad guy  blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare . all this and a catchy theme song  just like mitchell   
0,i thought i was going to watch a scary movie . . and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie . in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding . todays computer games have ten times better animations . low budget  is a fitting comment . i would recommend wolf       with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie . it has good special effects as they should be  human transforming to werewolf  . unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie . this movie is a joke .  
1,since starting to read the book this movie is based on  i  m having mixed feelings about the filmed result . i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book  because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film . this would undoubtedly have been true here  whereas in the case of atonement  which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i  ve ever seen  it would probably not have mattered .  br    br   i  m trying to figure out what the cause is  and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham . much as i respect him for the hours  which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by  i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton  s book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it .  br    br   it  s not that i dislike the movie . i actually love the movie  which is why  since i started reading the novel  i  m feeling disturbed about the whole thing . i feel disloyal to ms . minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work . reading it  i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it . unlike what one reviewer of the movie said  it  s not so much that some novels don  t deserve to be a movie it  s more like some books just can  t make the transition . ms . minton  s novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character  so internally  that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm . even though a lot of the book is memory of real events  it is memory  and so fragmented and ethereal as to be  i feel  not filmable . i think that ms . minton  s work is a real work of literature  but cannot make the transition to film  which in no way detracts from its value .  br    br   i cannot yet report that evening  the film  does not represent evening  the novel  in any more than the most superficial way  since i  m only halfway through  but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point . i guess i  m writing this because i feel that if you  re going to adapt a novel  adapt it  but don  t make it something else that it  s not . i  m not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original  but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else  s work . we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs . dalloway  and we would not have evening  in its distressed form  if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place . but it  s too much to say that it would be better if ms . minton had left well enough alone  because evening  the film  is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own .  br    br   thus my confusion  mixed feelings  sense of disloyalty  and ultimate conclusion that  in this case  the novel cannot be the film and vice versa  and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did  so that we have both works as they are .  
0,this movie has beautiful scenery . unfortunately it has no plot . in order to have a plot there must be a conflict . this movie had none . it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it . the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling .  br    br   if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don  t expect a story . there isn  t one .  
1,i have screened this movie several times here at college  and every time i show it  the number of people watching with me grows exponentially . . . in addition to the virgins  anyone i  ve already shown it to needs to see it again  it takes a little while to get into it  but by the end the whole room is screaming  shouting  yelling  rewinding scenes repeatedly  repeating dialogue  and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in  the lonely lady   scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed  poorly written  horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all  out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own  no small statement  friends  . for me nothing compares  u  pia . . . and i don  t suppose i  m the only one who  s ever felt this way   
1,  tulip  is on the  australian all shorts  video from  tribe first rites  showcasing the talents of first time directors .  br    br   i wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue .  br    br   i hope rachel griffiths has more stories to tell  she does it so well .  
1,why am i so convinced there  s actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere  i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying  there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed . they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him . mr . bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel  the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft  and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless  kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge  not the child . i am sure i  ve seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier . have i just imagined this   
1,if you ever see a stand up comedy movie this is the one . you will laugh nonstop if you have any sense of humor at all . this is a once in a lifetime performance from a once in a lifetime performer . this is a stand up standard .  
0,i  like many people  saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in    . it was a below average film at best  defiantly not the  masterpiece  that all these  titanic  fanboys like to make it out as . first off  dicaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it . people just like him because of his looks . his acting  skills  essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy . second  the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy  ship they  re on sinks  lots of crappy love scenes thereafter . anyone with an iq above   will realize this isn  t ingenious in any way whatsoever . nor is it original . plus the director felt the need to drag it out for   hours . i could compress it into a  hour block without losing any of the plot . in conclusion   titanic  is the most overrated movie to date . why it got so much attention and money is beyond me .  
0,this is just a bad movie . with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better . it almost were . with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek  hero fighting almost like jackie chan  battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger . . .  music almost like in  say  conan . . . etc . almost . but in the end it  s just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it . maybe apart of john rhys  davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before  mentioned crouching tiger . . . i am really ashamed of poor old john . he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better . so as you  so if you still have a chance just watch something else .  
0,but thomas ian griffith just doesn  t have the polish that a big bucks actor has  granted this was made   years ago . some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action  but comedy . and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow  plummer  s character was so corny  he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon . personally  if action flicks are going to show skin   i  d have liked to have seen equal time between female  male  otherwise don  t show any .  
1,all dogs go to heaven is a movie that i have always liked . when i was a kid  i used to watch this every other day . it is underrated if you look at its imdb rating and the comments of many people in general . this isn  t a bad movie like many say  it is a very good movie . this is good and your kids will probably like it . even though it  s rated g  some parents may find this to be a bit violent . it is actually a pretty dark story  where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling  extortion  and even cold blooded murder . the movie follows a dog named charlie who had escaped from the pound  is killed by his old friend  goes to heaven  but ends up coming back to earth . many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie .  br    br   there are some scenes that may scare little kids  but i  m sure they  ll do fine . every time i watch this movie  it reminds me of when i was a little kid . i  m sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger  this is the movie that makes me feel that way . the performances from burt reynolds and dom deluise are great  and this is the last movie that a little girl named judith barsi was in . unfortunately  she was killed at a young age  which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn  t deserve what happened . now that i know her story  i can  t watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad .  br    br   the animation in this movie is great  the voice work is great  and the story is good  but a little bit different from many other kids movies . this was popular at the time of its release  but was over shadowed by disney  s mega popular the little mermaid . this is a movie that isn  t conceived as well by adults  but if you  re a kid  or if you grew up with this movie as a kid  then i  m sure you will enjoy watching it .  
1,this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure  its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness  unlike  say  how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers  or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots  . many of the jokes fall flat . but still  this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not  and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king  but its not crap  either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead  i love mel as a director and writer  not so much as a lead  .  
0,do not bother to waste your money on this movie . do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you . if you must see a movie this weekend  go see batman again .  br    br   the script was horrible . perfectly written from the random horror movie format . given a place in confined spaces  a madman with various weapons  a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together  and an innocent and overly curious  yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend . mix together  add much poorly executed gore  and what the hell  let  s put some freaks in there for a little  spin  to the plot .  br    br   the acting was horrible  and the characters unbelievable  borat was more believable than this .  br    br   spoilerand can someone please tell me how a butcher  s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch    i  m in the army . we need that kind of stuff for ourselves .  br    br    out of    and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can .  
0,this became a cult movie in chinese college students  though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel   uk .  br    br   full of arty giddy pretentions  the plot is mediocre and unreal the  spirit  it wants to convey is how independent artists  resist the commercisliation of music industry  and maintain their  purity of an artistic soul  and wouldnt  sell themselves for dirty money  . that is really giddy and superficial the diologue are mainly pathetic . acting is poor . sceenplay is full of art pretention . it is a fantasy movie for kids and thats all  br    br    
0,  valentine  is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list  think  halloween    friday the   th    scream   and  i know what you did last summer   . it certainly isn  t as good as those movies that i have listed about  but it  s better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first  friday the   th  film . one of those films was the     canadian made  my bloody valentine   which i hated alot .  valentine  is a better film than that one  but it  s not saying much . the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film . then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up  then they  re picked off one  by  one . the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge . but is it him  or could it be somebody else   valentine  has an attractive cast which includes denise richards  david boreanaz  marley shelton  jessica capshaw  and katherine heigl . they do what they can with the material they  ve got  but a lackluster script doesn  t really do them any justice . there are some scary moments throughout  however .  br    br     out of four   
0,the     s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world  with an emphasis on wild animals  exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place  and then bringing  em back alive  with the film footage   such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features . . . because there were no expensive sets  costumes  or high  priced movie stars .  br    br   the most successful makers of such films  artistically and financially  were the team of martin e . johnson and his wife osa  who made several documentaries  sometimes with blatantly staged events  in africa and asia . the johnsons  safari films were extremely popular  inspiring several parodies . . . most notably wheeler  woolsey  s  so this is africa   in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs . johnson  martini  instead of martin e . johnson  geddit   . although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time  the johnsons  films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . viewed from our own more enlightened  i hope  standpoint  this is a serious flaw in the johnsons  documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife .  br    br   one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson . ten years younger than her husband  she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir  osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co  produced with her husband .  br    br    congorilla  is probably the best of the johnsons  films . the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in     . the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting  although these suffer from the johnsons  penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look  wild  and alien .  br    br   the best  and funniest  scene in  congorilla  is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women .  the dance is the black bottom  no less . . . the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton  the conjoined twins .  wearing jodhpurs  riding boots  and a pith helmet  osa johnson starts scat  singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women . meanwhile  they just stand there staring at her  apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . it  s a very funny scene  but it has unpleasant undertones . osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration  using natural rhythm  i guess  because it  s in their blood  or something .  br    br   i  ll rate  congorilla   points out of   . this film says a little bit about african life in the     s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade .  
1,  why did they make them so big  why didn  t they just give the money to the poor   the question about cathedrals was asked by a student to mr . harvey during a school field trip to salisbury cathedral .  that  s a good question   he replied .  partly to inspire them  to get them to look up with awe .  i  m not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone  but this movie certainly had that impact on me . it was awesome   br    br   it didn  t start out that way . for a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of  well  a school field trip to salisbury cathedral . if you  ve ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it . you have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day  the bus driver who  s driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control . been there  done that  got the t  shirt was my initial reaction . i figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students . yawn  but it turns out to be so much more  timothy spall was brilliant as mr . harvey  a sombre  unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals . over the course of the movie  his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story . we also get introduced to some of the troubled students  most notably helen  also brilliantly played by nathalie press  who  s into self  mutilation .  br    br   this isn  t a religious movie  but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes . when harvey  s colleague jonathon  played by ben miles  says  i don  t care what anyone believes as long as they don  t try to force it on anyone else  harvey replies   that isn  t tolerance  it  s indifference    which is  in fact  in my opinion  what often passes for religious tolerance in our society . there are scenes of reconciliation between various characters  and the final scene of the movie was brilliant . as harvey climbs back on the bus  director susanna white has the camera slowly pan upwards  so that the final shot is simply of the sky  hearkening back to harvey  s comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe . the cathedral accomplishes its goal . we look up into the universe in awe  seeking something greater than ourselves  however we choose to define it . this is a very powerful and very inspiring movie .      
0,johnny weissmuller  s final film as  king of the jungle   after   years in the role  tarzan and the mermaids  is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans . at    the ex  olympian  one of hollywood  s most active  party animals   was long past the slim athleticism of his youth  and looked tired  although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry  tarzan and the huntress  .  br    br   not only had weissmuller gotten too old for his role johnny sheffield  the quintessential  boy   had grown to manhood  he was a strapping    year old   so he was written out of the script  under the pretext of being  away at school  . brenda joyce  at    was appearing in her fourth of five films as  jane   she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan  in      s tarzan  s magic fountain  and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever .  br    br   produced by sol lesser  at rko  on a minuscule budget  the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico . while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa  veteran director robert florey utilized the country extensively  incorporating cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story .  br    br   when a young island girl  tyrone power  s future bride  linda christian  is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan  he learns that a local high priest  george zucco  one of filmdom  s most enduring villains  had virtually enslaved the local population  threatening retribution from a living  god  if they don  t do his bidding . the girl had been chosen to become the  god  s  bride  so she fled . faster than you can say  is this a dumb plot or what    the girl is kidnapped by the priest  s henchmen and returned to the island  and tarzan  followed by jane  colorful spanish character  benjy   charmingly played by john laurenz  who sings several tunes   and a government commissioner are off to take on the deity and his priest  poor cheeta is left behind  . after a series of discoveries  the  god  is simply a con man in an aztec mask  working with the priest in milking the island  s rich pearl beds   a bit of brawling action  and comic relief and songs by benjy  everything reaches the expected happy conclusion .  br    br   remarkably  tarzan and the mermaids features a musical score by the brilliant film composer  dimitri tiomkin  and is far better than what you  d expect from this  b  movie   br    br   while the film would provide a less  than  auspicious end to weissmuller  s time in tarzan  s loincloth  he would immediately go on to play jungle jim  a more eloquent variation of the ape man  in khakis   the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been .  br    br   tarzan was about to get a make over  and become much sexier . . .  
0,my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show . i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is . but he goes on watching it none the less . that is his right as an american i guess . but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode . it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can  t stand . i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college . my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed  but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors . and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along  get the pun  ha  ha . like spielberg did . it  s like jesus before he became a man . or thats at least what i think that would feel like . any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this  even though it contains little of peter falk . i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet . this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo  s investigation  as many later episodes would do .  
1,i really like this show . that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist  and that he fired masiela lusha off the show  simply because he discovered that she wasn  t a latino emigrant  but was an emigrant from albania . i learned this from people on the show . she was really one of the better parts of the show  and thus  to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism  that they can also hate someone  just because of the country where they were born  is really disappointing . i really like this show . that is why i was disappointed to learn recently that george lopez is a racist  and that he fired masiela lusha off the show  simply because he discovered that she wasn  t a latino emigrant  but was an emigrant from albania . i learned this from people on the show . she was really one of the better parts of the show  and thus  to learn that even among those who you would think would be sensitive to racism  that they can also hate someone  just because of the country where they were born  is really disappointing .

0,i saw this film at its premier at sundance   .  br    br   since american beauty is a movie that had something to say  i had hopes for towelhead . unfortunately  it was a disappointment . in fact  of countless movies i  ve seen in almost a dozen sundance festivals  towelhead is the only sundance movie i  ve ever wanted to walk out early from .  br    br   the worst problem with towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of  provocative  concepts concerning cultural stereotypes  rather than with an organic human drama . the screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by alicia erian . the famous edith wharton quote comes to mind i have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author  s political views . that observation is especially devastating for towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic . if there ever was a time when towelhead  s white male villains  condescending portrayals of blacks  ironic treatments of foreign cultures  etc .  were fresh  it  s long past .  br    br   for a more detailed review  please look up any of the many professional reviews available online . almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on .  br    br   on the other hand  the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled . as you read through the reviews in this and similar sites  you  ll frequently come across superlatives  stunning    breathtaking    profound    shocking   . . . it embarrasses me to read them  but it does not surprise me . indeed  i  ve encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial  cultural  gender  or sexual issues as deeply moving  thought provoking  full of profound insight . if you are such a person  by all means  rent towelhead and be moved by it . on the other hand  if you set your standards higher  you can safely pass on this one .

1,titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic . the plot is simple  noncomplicated  or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense . the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film  but the love story is an interesting one  however . kate winslett is wonderful as rose  an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal  billy zane  . early on the voyage rose meets jack  leonardo dicaprio   a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game . if he wants something  he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries . the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes .  br    br   the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures  that sunk with the titanic  which has recently occurred . one of the survivors of the titanic  rose dewitt bukater  who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search . she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic . with this  the scene shifts to southhampton  ireland where the titanic set sail from on april        as all the passengers are boarding . after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york . historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful  but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger  jack dawson . captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned . smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty  two years of experience to stretch the titanic  s legs out to full speed . the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs  but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie . on april        at       an iceberg was sighted . they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film . the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate . the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until     when the lights finally failed . the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic  s many pleas for help . the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own . the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship . overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too . the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking . also  the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold  which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle . overall  the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic .  br    br   many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship . the core group of rose  jack  cal  and rose  s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time . yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer  thomas andrew the white star line representative  bruce ismay and all of the titanic  s officers were real . the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith  s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards . he had been a part of the white star line since     where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire  s captain when the titanic sunk . the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol . he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer  s former canadian hometown . as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower  class passengers from non  english speaking nations . in addition  officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted . the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss  . not wanting to leave her husband  s side mrs . strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic . furthermore  mr . goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best . the richest man on the ship  john jacob astor  who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well  but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat . in addition  molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water . her ticket on the titanic had cost over four  thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke . all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware . the gymnasium  which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs . the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re  creation of the post  victorian era of     . the rich at this time practically ruled everything  as the women  s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet . women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do . the rich did not take well to new money  such as molly brown as depicted . everything of the time was very formal . women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes . smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes  which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie . men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes . women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society . although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross  referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken . the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking .  br    br   a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise . the director  james cameron  shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people  s lives . everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night . in addition  this film is a reflection of the      s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic . only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored . this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed . however  the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed . there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed . as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter .  br    br   technically the film is very well done . to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie . in addition  a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean . cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the   years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship . furthermore  throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage . this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner . at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film .  br    br   titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art  a true epic . like most history novels  we know the ending  but it doesn  t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture . certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming  sound  cintematography  and editing . if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early      s and how they face disaster  then this movie definitely is for you .  br    br    
0,after watching many of the  next action star  reality tv eps tivo taped this gawd  awful tripe for me . for some bizarre reason  and i only have myself to blame  i watched the whole thing  hoping that there would be something unique in the entire movie . after so much hype about joel silver  s  midas touch  with action flicks  he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy .  br    br   first  the only redeeming value of the entire film was billy zane  and even he couldn  t lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper . having said that  zane  s performance falters about    rds of the way through  as he doesn  t even seem to know what else to do other than look smug .  br    br   can  t blame him here  though . the writing  quite frankly  sucked . let  s take ideas from  rat race    enemy of the state    terminator    midnight run  and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it . and who  s brilliant idea was it to have two bridge chase sequences in a row   br    br   sean carrigan  the  man of the hour  of  the next action star  shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series . a one  note johnny  sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well  but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film . quite frankly  we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid  way through  as carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him . his dumb  but  lucky routine gets old as there really isn  t anything about the character to root for .  br    br   but carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden  rigid corinne van ryck de groot . did howard fine really tell her to pretend to be a terminator for the first half of the film  i don  t think so . i kept expecting her to quote arnie . her character  performance  can be compared only to the dramatic depths of  freddy got fingered   though not nearly as well  developed . the camera loves her in dark  shadowy limousines  but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen . jeanne bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than corinne showed at any part of her screen time .  br    br   ultimately  sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast  but shouldn  t have been left to do this one solo . it was simply too big of a task for him .  next action star  colleague jared elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization  but it  s hard to tell given jeff welch  s lame script . someone should take welch  s imac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else . and finally  van ryck de groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach  even for complete shlock like this .  br    br   joel silver should be ashamed .  
0,so i finally saw the film  my left foot  last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is . . . the central performance of day  lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing  but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less .  br    br   the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk . on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable  and disability shouldn  t obscure that . i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn  t be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable . they don  t . acting out is normal  and so yes  disabled people act out  but they don  t do it because they  re disabled they do it because they  re being unreasonable . a physical impairment doesn  t afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public  just because someone you love turns you down .  br    br   there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able  bodied . giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them .  admittedly  i did once save a penalty from the school  s star striker with my face  but i already belonged by then . it wasn  t for acceptance .  engaging in a bar brawl is another . revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you  ve proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far . all of these things are stupid  and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn  t make them any less foolhardy .  br    br   so yes just because you  ve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn  t make you any less of a jerk . . . being a good person takes priority setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list .  
0,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . while featuring good actors the movie doesn  t live up to the expectations . the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music  which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known  good actors  loud and dramatic music . it doesn  t change the fact  that this is a very boring movie to watch . earned itself a score of  .  
0,a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town  cats and death soon follow them . that about sums it up .  br    br   i  ll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie . but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film  and believe me there is plenty of that to go around  it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience .  br    br   the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on . fear  greed  pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people . although it can be argued that that seeming failing  in actuality  serves the telling of the story . the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay  not that i have anything specific against mr . king  are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work  makeup and quite suitable music . the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady  the otherworldly mother .  br    br   king manages to take a simple story of outsider  or people who are a little different  okay  a lot in this case   trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan .  
1,baseketball is awesome  it  s hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing . i have seen it so many times i have stopped counting . but everytime it gets funnier .  br    br   trust me on this one . . . baseketball is a surefire hit and i loved it and will continue to love it . i hope one day there will be a special edition dvd brought out     br    br   ten thumbs up     
1,yes  this gets the full ten stars . it  s plain as day that this fill is genius . the universe sent trent harris a young  wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape  in all that true misfit glory that you just can  t fake . too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man  if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow  s story . the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story  with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men  respectively . the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling  giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america . recommended for anyone and everyone   
0,this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with . but first the movie  it  s a typical tv movie version of a play which means it doesn  t have the flair of the original film version with william holden . what they couldn  t afford to hire more than twelve people as extras  why move the movie up to      so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests  why not     and give her a line about the civil rights movement   br    br   as for the casting  some hits some misses . jay o . sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin . brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes . he  s believable as an ex  bmoc jock but he doesn  t have the raw sensuality of william holden . i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him  pardon the pun  . gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played . she didn  t project the innocence or ignorance that the character required . maybe it  s because she and brolin were about  years older than the characters should be . but then again holden was ten years too old . bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen can  t seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from  the taming of the shrew  .  br    br   as for mr . inge  s play  i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue .  the twilight zone  i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode   spur of the moment  where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland  because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter .  
1,this is your standard musical comedy from the     s  with a big plus that it features some well known     s actors in small fun cameo  s .  br    br   there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and  no  worries  overall kind of atmosphere  with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it . appereantly it  s a  cinderella story  but i most certainly didn  t thought of it that way while watching the movie . the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling  that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance  when the main characters hit the hollywood studios .  br    br   of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel  hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . it  s like watching a movie and getting a laurel  hardy short with it for free . also laurel  hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson  without a mustache this time  as the director of the short .  br    br   it  s certainly true that all of the cameo  s and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem  since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character .  br    br   the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period  though the rating on here would suggest otherwise .  br    br        
0,i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of  jerry springer  . i don  t consider myself a snob  but i really think that i am above watching what  s on his show . you should try to elevate yourself above that too .  br    br   i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was conducting . i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself  rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on  springer .  handled better  this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people  s lives actually are . i will admit  i felt a twinge of empathy for connie  molly hagan  . this is all she has in life . how sad that she feels she must go on jerry  s show in order to resolve this .  br    br   i really feel sorry for molly hagan appearing in this . have you noticed that after this movie  she has mainly been relegated to  b  roles on tv  i will say this about hagan . she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman . i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy . the problem is that hagan can  t carry a scene on her own . she just doesn  t have what it takes to do a lead role . her best work will always be angel on  herman  s head   a show that was not great  but its heart was in the right place  and when she guested on  seinfeld  as sister roberta .  
0,yes  people are racist . people are even racist in college . that  s a good point  and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films . what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham  fisted and predictable way possible  oh yeah it  s in college too .  br    br   this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems  it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner . most of the characters are cartoonish  one  dimensional  caricatures  lesbian feminist  angry black man   that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible . instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them . the angry black men feel cheated  feminists hate men  etc .  one feminist even holds a sign that reads  dead men don  t rape .  see what i mean   i don  t want to give anything away  but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they  ll probably behave exactly how you expect them to . the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie . the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo  nazis will act like violent neo  nazis . i  ll guess you  ll just have to watch to find out what happens .  br    br   another problem i have with this movie is that it  s supposed to be  gritty  and  hard  hitting   but they make nazis the bad guys . i agree nazis are evil  but that  s my point . everybody thinks nazis are bad we  re not breaking any new ground here . nazis have been portrayed as villains since the      s . the film doesn  t challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements . it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy  after  school  special like  manner . being anti  rape  anti  racist  and anti  nazi isn  t exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue .  br    br   higher learning is predictable  cartoonish  and in a word stupid . avoid at all costs .  
1,pendragon pictures  new film  h g wells  war of the worlds   the first faithful adaptation of the original novel  has been in development for about  years . a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year  march       but this never happened . the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg  s version  which hits theatres june   .  br    br   i liked this film  with certain reservations .  br    br   how faithful is the adaptation  it  s not quite     faithful to wells  book  but       faithful is good enough for me . at least several scenes were totally new  such as ogilvy the astronomer  s confrontation with a farmer  and the unnamed writer  narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin . but on the whole  this film follows the book very closely   certainly much more than the classic     version by george pal .  br    br   its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget . the majority of it seems to have been shot blue  screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds . this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots  and scenes of crowded city streets . the overviews of     london look like something from a video game . numerous scenes in horse  carriages were faked   i guess they couldn  t afford to rent a horse . the only scenes shot for  real  seem to be those in open fields or forests .  br    br   but within those budget restrictions  they managed to do quite a lot . artistically  the film looks right . the martians and their tripods are quite well done  and very true to wells  descriptions . i was particularly impressed with the heat ray . although the thunder child sequence  which should have been one of the film  s highlights  is very disappointing . it  s a great shame that they couldn  t afford more actual sets  or better quality animation .  br    br   the acting and direction won  t win any oscars . for the most part  they are competent  not bad  but not outstanding . the music is quite good also  though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers .  br    br   i  m actually glad this didn  t get a theatrical release  because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen . as it stands  i would rate this similarly to a bbc  tv adaptation of classic literature .  br    br   a few nitpicks most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters  mostly red  . this may have been an artistic choice  but it is used very inconsistently  and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd . and the writer  narrator  s obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene .  br    br   bottom line   is it worth seeing  if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations  and get into the story  i think you will enjoy this  especially if you  ve actually read the original h g wells novel . if  however  you are easily put off by cheap production values  you  d best pass on this  unless you  re a mst  k fan  . be warned  however that the film runs a full  hours  so i don  t recommend watching it all in one sitting .  br    br   btw an entirely different version of war of the worlds  aka  invasion   came out on dvd the same month that spielberg  s hit the theatres http   imdb . com  title  tt         . this was also made on a budget  but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film  but it  s much better  and to top it off  jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best  selling album from      but that won  t be out until     .  
0,the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call  girl  the other an upper  class political party . the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino  as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening .  br    br   if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama  the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man  as  the godfather   as here as a little servant  see also  donnie brasco   .  br    br   actually  the big young lion has become a tired old one . this passing of ages is very moving  because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too .  br    br   but his slowness is only a make  up because he can get back his energy in church scene .  br    br   maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al  s talent

0,i admit the problem i have with the much  celebrated ealing films i  ve seen so far could be mine . to my taste  either they are black and rippingly funny  or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories . that  s a self  important way of saying i wanted to like  the man in the white suit  but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time .  br    br   textile worker sidney stratton  alec guinness  may be meek in manner  but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that can  t be broken or made dirty . using a factory lab for his latest experiment  he toils against limitations both material and human  the latter being the benighted mill bosses who don  t understand what he is up to  then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him .  br    br    it  s small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress   sidney complains  practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man .  br    br   one problem with  man in the white suit  is that sidney  s vision of progress is awfully small  minded  too  more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work . my problem is more elemental for a comedy   white suit  is not funny . it  s a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit  takes  double  takes  triple  takes  and dizzy takes .  br    br   the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at  going  bleep  blop  bleep  bop  endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying . like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film  it  s leaned on too long .  br    br   i  ve never seen guinness less affecting in a movie  even though he looks impossibly young and earnest  though actually in his mid    s  . he seems so bloodless  even more so than the wax  faced general he played in  doctor zhivago  he  s the same cold fish whether he  s ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job  pan  faced vida hope as bertha  or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley  joan greenwood   his one real ally in his fight against  shabbiness and dirt   as she puts it  making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood could .  br    br   supporting players make  white suit  work as well as it does . ernest thesinger of  bride of frankenstein  fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle . howard marion  crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in  lawrence of arabia  . then there  s the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else .  br    br   but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn  t think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before  his previous ealing comedy  whisky galore  doesn  t reverse that impression  alas  . roger macdougall  s play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster  but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights .  br    br   ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy . yet the ealings i  ve seen never seem to do this  working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies .  kind hearts and coronets  and  the ladykillers   mackendrick again  go figure  are classics this way .  white suit   on the other hand  is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere  just like that unfortunate suit .  
0,this movie is supposed to be a  lighthearted  tale about santa claus and his  magical and mystical  wonders . but instead it comes off as being downright creepy . two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are   the way santa looks .  have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus  and   the  evil rep . of satan  pitch  s just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch . only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh . i can  t believe this is a children  s movie .  
1,this is a lovely tale of guilt  driven obsession .  br    br   matiss  on a lonely night stroll in riga    passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing . he passes by without a word . only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act . and then only too little and too late .  br    br   the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman . on a troll of local bars  he finds her pocketbook . he pieces more and more of her life together . his  look  changes as his obsession grows . he has to make things right . in a marvelously filmed dialog with the  bastard ex  boyfriend  he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel .  br    br   haunting long takes  a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt  barking dogs . footsteps . lovely film noir with a lovely twist . a good indie ending .  
0,this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured . there  s male full frontal nudity  dead animal parts  dogs licking nipples  the female loosing control of her bladder . all shot in a gray cold color . effective  but a little too much . we then move on to seeing the btk killer  s youth as well as the present and his history of crimes . the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it  s creepy . here we don  t see fancy or good imagery  it looks as if shot with your home camera . it doesn  t look horrifying  but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling . what this movie doesn  t have is any drama  really . there are some cop scenes every once in a while  but there  s no excitement in terms of them finding the killer . there isn  t much of an arc to this story . this could have been an effective psychological thriller  a study of madness . unfortunately  the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage . it  s dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again . sometimes you don  t know it  s coming and don  t have enough time to look away . and that i have to reject . i  m all for low budget horror movies but i don  t tolerate animal suffering . it was unnecessary  excessive  and comes without warning . i  m glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does  but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore . stay away from this garbage .  
0,i  ve just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions . a bunch of kids    to   put on the dvd of  titanic  on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal . only two of them had actually seen it before . but they all had seen the moment of kate  leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie . shortly after the epic started  they started to get restless  some of them left asking the others    call us when the iceberg appears  over an hour and a half into the movie  only the two girls who had seen the movie before  were still there . they started shouting iceberg  iceberg . a stampede followed  they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic . they sat open mouthed  emitting ohs and far outs . so  just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene . what is this  one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it . dr . zivagho  for instance  had a similar running time  but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time . in  titanic  leo teaches kate how to spit . look at the faces and hands of the  supposedly  creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship . look at the historical details  if you can find them . the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink . the real sinking here is of film standards . all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends . the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so  what do i know   
0,spoiler warning .  br    br   when the main character  s sister is pushed down the stairs  the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her  to make it appear that she  s been drinking . but right before she is killed  tells her sister  s business partner  teri garr  on the phone that she hasn  t had a drink in  days . yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report  and  the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs . huh  really bad mistake in this movie  which is pretty awful  overall .  br    br   surprisingly bad  considering the great cast . some faults the writing isn  t very good  the music is made  for  tv bad  and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie .  
1,citizenx       is the developing world  s answer to silence of the lambs . where silence  terrorized our peace of mind  citizen  exhausts and saddens us instead . this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well  thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals .  br    br   citizenx may also argue against    the death penalty far better than kevin spacey  s the life of david gayle       .  br    br   humans are machiavellian mammals  under which lie limbic brains  lizard  logic  . why did two kids  who knew better  stone to death a toddler they kidnapped  why do bloodthirsty women yell li  lilililililii  at acts of obscene terrorism   my own term for this is limbic domination   the lizard  logic urge to dominate an enemy  . if you have the words enemy   vengeance  in your vocabulary  you  re easily capable of limbic domination  .  br    br   in wwii  devastated     s rostov  located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea   nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo  s urge for limbic domination  from overpowering his layers of civilization . chikatilo  jeffrey demunn   s easy victims were paupers  usually children  who rode the interurban train for fun  since they couldn  t afford anything else .  br    br   citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of   such lambs  . rostov  s serial killer roamed free for almost  years after the police arrested and let him go .  br    br   the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world  in the west  vote  grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter  agency rivalries  stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . in the soviet union of citizenx  however  viktor burakov  stephen rea   s killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy .  br    br   geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority   to the point of complete obscurity . in real life  too  chikatilo had a lifetime  s experience blending in and evading capture .  br    br   his pursuer  on the other hand  sticks out as a strange bird  given to unheralded  naive outbursts . perhaps by design  stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov . rea  s russian accent is impenetrable and his burakov is humourless and sullen  at odds with everyone .  br    br   so it  s donald sutherland who walks away with the picture . sutherland  s col . fetisov  burakov  s boss  and at first his only supporter  is an overly restrained  patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . his reawakening as a logic  driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film  s cornerstone idealism .  br    br   joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik  secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk  overseeing the investigation . naturally  he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect  a communist  in      a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag  supposedly going home andrei chikatilo .  br    br   soon  he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik  detective gorbunov  john wood   insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals  . the funniest scene of this sad  sad film comes during bondarchuk  s  gorbunov  s institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports  as i suspected  comrade  it  s fornication . i  ve made some drawings    cue howling laughter .  br    br    yrs after the bodies began piling up  in      the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky  max von sydow   who termed the unsub citizenx  . he later also observed to fetisov  burakov that  . . . together you make a wonderful person  . we concur .  br    br   the drawn  out pace  spread over a decade  perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost   openness    that wasn  t . the contrast with perestroika   restructuring    couldn  t  ve been greater for the case . although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations  police plans were about to bear fruit .  br    br   in      col . fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general . his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene  allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . staff  communications  publicity   suddenly all were available . in just one night of telephoning around  fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi  s serial murder task force at quantico  where  fetisov discovered  staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators .  br    br   fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief  now colonel  burakov  of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie  s powerhouse watershed scene . fetisov  s is the most tender apology i  ve ever seen on film privately  i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance   he almost whispers .  br    br   a hbo production  citizenx is a film of the highest caliber . not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak  shot exclusively in the most run  down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest   but randy edelman  s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming   and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits .  br    br   chikatilo  s actual murders are depicted as bleak  aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world . this makes the murders seem not  entirely  out  of  place   but of course they were . as president kennedy reminded us  we all cherish the futures of our children  .  br    br   citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply . serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate . so do some soldiers . such limbic dominators  make poor humans .  br    br   warning  spoiler                                                the real andrei chikatilo was the world  s most prolific known serial killer . convicted  he was executed in     in the manner of all soviet union death sentences one shot  in the back of the head . foolishly  such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death .  br    br   conclusion                                                             the best outcome is always the prevention of killings  not their prosecution . executions merely guarantee society  s failure to learn from the complex reality of victims  deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how  why they died . nor do killers learn regret if they  re dead .  br    br   vengeance doesn  t unkill victims . baying for the killer  s blood constitutes nothing better than counter  domination   once it  s too late .  br    br   vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn  t justice for the deceased   it  s appeasement of the living .         
1,in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown  which is a lot  this film even goes back to before simba and  presumbably  just after the birth of kiara .  br    br   quite true to the first film   lion king     or lion king  in other places   is a funny  entertaining  exciting and surprising film  or sequel if that  s what you want to call it  . a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you   br    br   while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema  with a remote control   timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of  the lion king  they are going to start watching  as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning . they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story  which is what awaits . . . it starts with timon  s first home . . .  br    br   for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age  enjoy  lion king          
1,i can understand why some people like this movie  and why some people don  t . for me  though  i really like it  even if i noticed some good bits  and not so impressive bits . the animation was actually excellent  like charlie  s dream . the characters were a mixed bag  the best being anne  marie  voiced by the late judith barsi .  i was physically ill when i read what happened to her  also  carface is a very convincing villain  especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback  i particularly loved  morons i  m surrounded by morons   and along with rasputin and warren t . rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains . charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle  but i loved king gator and his song . some of the film is very haunting  like annabelle  s  you can never come come back   which kind of scares me still . unfortunately  there were some bits i didn  t like so much . the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused  but disney  s black cauldron suffered from the same problem . also there were some dark scenes  that young children would find upsetting  but the ending is very poignant . however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung . none of them in particular stick out  with exception of  let  s make music together  and  love survives   and burt reynolds can  t sing and dom deluise has done much better singing . all in all  a watchable movie  that could have been more  but is definitely memorable  and i would definitely watch it again .     . bethany cox  
0,yes  the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro . it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature  stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . add in harry andrews  with a strange accent  no less  chasing an ostrich  tons of stock footage of wildlife  and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard  and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal .  
0,i may not be a critic  but here is what i think of this movie . well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids  secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb    nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much .  
0,whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies .  br    br   a loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family . the movie is filled with idiots and includes live  teabagging  . that should sum it all up for you .  br    br   do not waste your time . you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on  it doesn  t   
0,apart from helen bonham carter  there is nothing worthy about this movie . . . . and the surprise ending   the thought of a sequel is even more annoying . save your money  wait for the video and ignore that too .  
1,the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn . it  s peak years were between     and     . one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle  who had a small but fanatic cult of followers . she was actually able to act  unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks  and her subsequent credits proved it . and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique .  br    br   gary graver  the director  was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre  and his skill  combined with monica gayle  s screen presence  makes sandra  the making of a woman  a pleasantly enjoyable experience . the film never drags and you won  t have your finger pressed on the fast  forward button .  
0,rock star john norman howard  kris kristofferson  turns lounge singer esther hoffman  barbra streisand  into an overnight singing star . esther  s star rises while john  s goes into decline  thanks to drugs and alcohol . after about two hours  john does the self  destructive  red  converible      mph  crack  up  on  a  desert  highway thing . the best thing about this movie is the music  especially the song   evergreen .  barbra streisand sings well  but you can  t take her seriously as an up  and  coming star  when she is already a star . the very first time she appears  singing in a back alley bar  she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night  not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career . she is too confident  too professional . her apartment looks like a page out of  apartment living   not some hole  in  the  wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live .  br    br   kris kristofferson handles the self  centered  out  of  control rock star role like . . . well  like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn  t have much acting talent . the direction is tepid  the story is slow and dull .  br    br   but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting  or the lame direction  or the slow story . it  s the hair  after staring at kristofferson  s and streisand  s awful    s hairdos for   hours  your eyes hurt .  
0,i recently watched this again and there  s another version which is shorter     . i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference .  br    br   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with . ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice    br    br   prof ivy was rather boring . she sounded as if she was almost asleep  no expression at all with the few lines she had .  br    br   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn  t much to it at all .  br    br   a collector  whos after lugia  he has no plan to destroy the world  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction .  br    br   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better  deoxys  poke   is great  with no .  almost here .  
1,i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region  dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it . a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan .  br    br   the story is pretty straight forward  and has been mentioned already so i won  t go into it again . needless to say it  s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for  and they do not disappoint . only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed . bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time  all kicks and punches come with the all important  type writer  clicks and air  whooshes   which is a cool effect though quite amusing   br    br   i give this movie a b . good but not great . in a way i feel it could have been that bit better . golden swallow  by the same director a decade earlier  had as good a story and better action .  
0,in      charlie chaplin began making pictures . these were made for mack sennett  also known as  keystone studios   and were literally churned out in very rapid succession . the short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed . as a result  the films  though popular in their day  were just awful by today  s standards . many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera . many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing . and  regardless of the outcome  keystone sent them straight to theaters . my assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad  as the keystone films with chaplin were very successful .  br    br   the charlie chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in chaplin  s career with keystone . by      he signed a new lucrative contract with essenay studios and the films improved dramatically with chaplin as director . however  at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable . no  chaplin as the cute little tramp was still evolving . in      when he switched to mutual studios  his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy   in many of the previous films he was just a jerk  either getting drunk a lot  beating up women  provoking fights with innocent people  etc .  . the final evolution of his little tramp to classic status occurred in the     s as a result of his full  length films .  br    br   it  s interesting that this film is called twenty minutes of love since the film only lasts about   minutes  oh well . the plot  what little there is  involves the little tramp in the park . a couple wants to neck but inexplicably  charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple  s lap and really annoying them . i can  t understand why and the short consists of charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film . perhaps he was looking for a threesome  i don  t know . but the film lacks coherence and just isn  t particularly funny   even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake . a typical poor effort before chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality .  
1,maybe it  s because i saw the movie before reading the book  but i really love this movie . i  ve seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more . it  s a compelling story  that  s interesting from the beginning to the end . it has everything action  romance etc .  
0,the problem with the contracter is summed up by the opening scene . the cia want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin james dial . the terrorist is appearing at the old bailey court in london which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he  s going to spend the rest of his life in jail  he  s going to be out of circulation either way . didn  t the cia have a chance before he was arrested  if by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him . there  s no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison  br    br   since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire . dial  s colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they  re driving in crashes but dial manages to escape . so the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash  the film of this type of plot connivance . later dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying  this airport is surrounded by armed coppers  yet dial manages to escape very easily without explanation . the whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained . this includes an important supporting character called emily day . why does she help dial even though he  s a wanted fugitive  your guess is as good as mine  br    br   this is a fairly poor thriller and don  t be taken in by the  big name  cast . wesley snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films . charles dance also appeared in big budget hollywood productions such as last action hero and alien  but again he  s someone best known for appearing in straight to dvd fare these days  and he  s basically playing a cameo role anyway . the likes of lena headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they  l certainly fail to put the contracter on their resume  
1,i am black american and i loved this soap opera . i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo  almost    years ago . the story was a true story about a black slave who  s love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid  whimsical way of living .  br    br   a lot of us could learn a lot from xica . she took what she had  nothing  and saw her possibilities . many would argue that she sold herself out  but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children .  br    br   it was such an excellent soap opera  that i thought it would be released on dvd  but it  s not being released . this soap opera was the best soap opera ever . we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again . it  s playing on azteca america right now  which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable . we need it released again to telemundo .  
1,i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work . finally found it yesterday        on lifetime movie channel .  br    br   jim larson  s comments about it being a  sweet funny story of  people crossing paths  were dead on . writers probably shouldn  t get a bonus  everyone else sro for making the movie .  br    br   anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it .  br    br   natasha  s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric  to say nothing of her beauty  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for .  br    br   god bless her  her family and future endeavors .  br    br   this movie doesn  t seem to available in dvd or video yet  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too .  
0,they made me watch this in school and it was terrible . the movie is outdated . the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting . the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience . i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors  but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life . this accounts for cheesy acting very often . also  very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far  fetched . i don  t like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them . though  it was written to be educational  funny  suspenseful  and hip  it ended up being boring  dry  far  fetched  and old . i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it .  
0,watching josh kornbluth  act  in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class  where the  not funny  had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were   br    br   obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy . the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed . the delivery is painfully bad . ouch        the writing is simply dorkish . it is akin to a bob saget show .  br    br   watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit  post belushi  .  br    br   i hated this movie and want my money back     
0,the only remarkable fact is the participation of klaus kinski who plays a priest . don  t ask me why he does it  a bad  bad movie overall .  br    br    
0,my husband and i are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same township as the screenwriter of this movie . we were very upset that the jcc is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed . we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out . we demanded out money back . we would encourage the screenwriter to donate a portion of the funds to the jcc  s achad program to apologize .  br    br   we did not like seeing frankie  a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager  as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the nanny  s breasts .  br    br   there was no point to frankie  s character other than to say  hey  being mentally disabled is funny .  challenges like frankie  s are a serious matter . families like mine are truly suffering .  br    br   the screenwriter needs to explain herself . does she know families with disabled kids  does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the jcc pool   
1,if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet  then the lion king   hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead . just like tom stoppard  s beguiling film  we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original timon  the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat  and pumbaa  the warthog with flatulence issues . by following their story  rather than simba  s  we get to see why all the animals bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock . we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar . and we find out how they dealt with the hyena  s once and for all . nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes  but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa . it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their roles . julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters timon  s mother and uncle . the only downside is the constant stop  start  rewind  fast  forward device which doesn  t always help to progress the story . having said that  there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie . with more laughs than any other third  in  a  disney  series movie  hakuna matata is worth watching  if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable .  
1,the story of a drifter  his sheep ranch boss  and the boss  s daughter is not for all tastes  but it  s still very intriguing . it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand  amongst the scenery we  ve come to know so well through other films from this region .  br    br   this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan  and i  ve been a fan of hers ever since . the cast also contains bruno lawrence  who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film  smash palace  . terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter  regan  .  br    br   sharply acted  with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads . i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america  but believe you me  the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .  
1,in the aftermath of watergate  a number of conspiracy movies appeared  such as this one  written by the late adam kennedy  based on his novel  .  br    br   gene hackman plays ex  vietnam veteran  roy tucker   a loser who has wound up in prison . he receives visits from marvin tagge  richard widmark   who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted . they offer him freedom  and despite distrusting tagge he accepts . but he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of spiventa  mickey rooney  . exactly why is hard to see  as spiventa is an irritating little man who drives tucker mad with persistent talk of sex  not what you want to hear when you are behind bars .  br    br   tagge  s benefactors kill spiventa before tucker  s astonished eyes . reunited with wife ellie  candice bergen   and given a new identity  strangely  he does not attempt to change his appearance . shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start   he settles down  but finds there is a catch  tagge wants tucker to do no less than assassinate the president of the united states . he refuses  so tagge has ellie abducted . . .  br    br   i will leave the synopsis here  but i am sure you can guess the rest for yourself . the script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book  neat trick that   . the people tagge represents are never revealed . the allusions to j . f . k .  s killing are unmistakable . despite the findings of the warren commission  the doubt as to whether lee harvey oswald acted alone persists to this day .  br    br   this was stanley kramer  s first movie in years  and while no turkey  it lacks the grip of say john frankenheimer  s  the manchurian candidate  or alan j . pakula  s  the parallax view  . being a left  wing conspiracy movie  it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it . i prefer right  wing ones myself  they are funnier   domino  has the look and feel of a made  for  t . v . movie  and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the michael caine classic  get carter  .  br    br   what makes it watchable are gene hackman and richard widmark . the latter  who sadly passed away earlier this year  is superb as the mysterious tagge  who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated  beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall  just like dominoes . as tucker  the innocent pawn  hackman is marvellous . you have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place . in his shoes  i  d have fled to the other side of the world  anywhere to get away from these fanatics . hackman  s love scenes with bergen slow the plot down  and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched . presumably the producers thought so too  which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film  s entire premise  voiced by british actor patrick allen  warning the audience that  they  are out there  and that  they  are out to get us . comedian les dawson later spoofed this opening in his b . b . c . show  the dawson watch  .  br    br   mickey rooney had earlier worked with kramer on  its a mad  mad  mad  mad  mad world  . his  death  scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture  with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead .  br    br   conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left  but now the right are getting in on the act too . last year   taking liberties   an absurd concoction of lies and half  truths about tony blair  s government turned out to be britain  s answer to  reefer madness  . at least   domino  had lovely candice bergen . the best chris atkins  film could offer was anne widdecombe   br    br   surprisingly   the domino principle  was made by sir lew grade  the legendary british television mogul behind  the saint    jesus of nazareth  and  the muppet show  . he worked with adam kennedy again in     on  raise the titanic    whose failure was so great it sank grade  s ambitions of being the new louis b . meyer . being somewhat open  minded  i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy .  
1,as one other imdb reviewer has remarked  this movie starts a bit slow  but gets considerably better as it goes along . yes  it is released by roger corman  and yes  it goes over some of the same thematic ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison ivy . however  the juxtapositioning of the wife  s career as a rising blues singer against the husband  s gathering loneliness and his almost freudian need for filling the emotional and physical  void  or  hole  while she  s away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done . utilizing a very small number of locations and characters  and also using water in almost every scene both as a cleansing and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout  this movie  though clearly suffering from a minuscule budget  reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario  namely the french film  swimming pool  which it seems to me at least may have borrowed liberally some useful ideas from  up against amanda .  with a smaller tool set  up against amanda maintains its suspense with a rudimentary  fatalistic view of surrendering to ones occasional lustful temptations  but accomplishes this as well or better as other films in this genre . the twist of the stepfather abuse of amanda in the past  again  very freudian  is also very unique in this genre and interesting . i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for amanda  s plight this aspect of the story elicits . the cast is excellent i think .  br    br    
1,in the movie several references are made in subtly to blade runner  but one of the most obvious is the fact the cain    and his unit are all genetic constructs  breed to be expendable warriors . but as favorite quote of mine from the movie is   you should have made them smart as well as fast  . kurt russell did a incredible job  his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined . even when he falls in love with sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions  and his tears after being expelled from the group  or his shuddering when he is given a hug  and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded todd of himself  and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier .  
0,if you really  truly want to waste two hours of your life  do the following  br    br     look through the tv listings .   find the movie  men in white  .   when  men in white  comes on  sit and watch .  br    br   and that  s it . after sitting through two hours of bad puns  dreadful  and not that funny  movie references  and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history  you will have wasted two hours of your life  and wonder exactly why .  br    br   why did i do this  i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good . it wasn  t .  br    br   but  on the other hand  if you  re old enough to remember power rangers  you might spot some familiar faces during the film . presumably to save on production costs  saban  who also make power rangers   decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone  s favourite tacky toy  spawning franchise throughout the film . i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid  so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value .  br    br   but  if you want to see actual power rangers monsters  go watch power rangers itself . it  s much better than this piece of garbage .  and that  s saying something    
1,legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world  s greatest fairy tales to the screen . they remain among the most popular animated films of all time . the first was his groundbreaking classic  snow white and the seven dwarfs  released in     . the last was the then  under appreciated  sleeping beauty  which made it  s debut in     . in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale  cinderella        . of the three films   cinderella  is the one most faithful to its origins . ironically  unlike  snow white   which for better or worse  became for many the definitive version of the story .  cinderella  did not follow the same path . although it was a hit and  like  snow white   was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes  it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved . disney  for once  did himself proud  electing not to tamper with a classic  instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale  rather than rewriting it for the screen . the result was enchanting .  br    br   a combination of superb animation  in beautifully soft technicolor  and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day . ilene woods  who was a radio performer  recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material  al hoffman  mack david  and jerry livingston . when disney heard them  he knew he had found his cinderella . and indeed he had . woods heartfelt renditions of  a dream is a wish your heart makes    so this is love  and  oh sing sweet nightingale  are perfect . eleanor audley  who would go on to voice maleficent in  sleeping beauty   masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother  while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters . luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke  and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus  cinderella  s devoted mice . william phipps has little dialog as the prince  future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice  but film  and disney  veteran  verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother  and she made the best number   the oscar  nominated  bibbidi  bobbidi  boo   her own show  stopper .  br    br   among the artists responsible for the  look  of the film  was mary blair  whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney . her elegant french  period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie . but  most important of all  are the believable characters   from cinderella  right down to lucifer  the stepmother  s deliciously evil cat . they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story  something very difficult to create in an animated film .  br    br   in conjunction with the film  s    year anniversary   and  not so coincidentally  the coming holiday season   cinderella  has just been released on a special edition dvd . it simply has never looked better . the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated   suffice it to say  it looks wonderful . an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added  and serves the music well . the dvd extras  now a standard part of disney platinum editions  are too numerous to list here  but as usual  some are directed towards children  some are slanted to adults  and the rest fall somewhere in between . but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set  because  along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches  it includes a     page hardback book  which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the     special edition home video release  but much more as well . as usual for disney   cinderella  will only be available for a limited time . so  if like me  you are a  cinderella  lover  get it now  this edition is truly a  dream come true .   
0,i saw this movie a couple years back . i could  nt sleep and there was nothing on . so i peeped it . what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing . richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard  s girl while she  s unconscious . then jarvis  s buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar . by the next morning it shows richard  s girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he  s still tied up . then they play some happy music and the movie is finished . i mean what happened  did they brake up  and what was she saying to those  guys  trouby and jarvis   its to puzzling and to poor to . i can  t stand movies that are disturbing and don  t make sense . this was the worst film i  ve ever seen since the    s version of lord of the flies .  
0,omg  the only reason i  m giving this movie a  instead of a  is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis  in  the  box . apart from that  how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie   maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time . . . there are no laughs to mention  the stereotypes are pathetic  the cast is wasted  the direction is amateurish . now that i think about it  most of the blame probably lies with the director  joel zwick . he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved . don  t waste your time like i did but then  i enjoy a good train wreck . geez  now the system is telling me i need more lines   here ya go this movie should be called return to sender . okay  now that was funnier than anything in the movie . . .  
1,this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film  along the lines of tales from the crypt  written by robert bloch  author of psycho  . it  s good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast . the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee  the third doctor  has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star   
0,now i had the best intentions when watching this one . i like some of tony scott  s work  also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie  even though i heard otherwise from other people . but this was simply hopeless .  br    br   in my humble opinion  tony scott was trying too hard . it was all just too much . allow me to elaborate .  br    br   miss knightley was overacting  and not in a good way . the people who did perform well  were mickey rourke  edgar ramirez  and christopher walken  but their screen time just wasn  t able to save the movie .  br    br   there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality  yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer . a certain tune was used around  times  which really started to bug after the second time . i  m a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once .  br    br   also  the editing really went out on this one  as the cutting rate is rather high . oh  and the repetitive echoing of some of keira  s lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second  third  fourth time  and so on .  br    br   basically  my opinion is that if you want to see an action  flick that is high  paced and  somewhat  funny  and you don  t care about everything i mentioned above  you might like it .  br    br    on a side note i  m not a keira knightley fan .   
0,this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning . there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started . i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg  danny glover  in addition to that have always trusted  respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles   grand canyon  for example . i just could not finish this movie  after what seemed an eternity  but was probably just a little over an hour we had to turn it off . there was no comedy  there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them  there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited  confusing  and unnecessary . what could have been a great idea for a movie  even as a drama  not a comedy  although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better  because i love to watch white people freak out  start acting like complete idiots  it makes me laugh  became a waste of my   credit at the video store .  
0,this is a genuinely horrible film . the plot  such as it is  is totally undecipherable .  i think it has something to do with blackmail  but i  m not entirely certain .   br    br   half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches . the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of  southern  accents that  thankfully  the words cannot be recognized .  br    br   but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it .  br    br    
1,after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax . like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci  fi paraday .  captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick . he was a brave man .  the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket . and always remember to beware of the  doughnut of death   keep in mind the number one rule of this movie  suspension of disbelief  sit back and relax  and  prepare to die earth scum   you just have to see it for yourself .  
1,an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly . watch as gene sings  acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations . some purely majestic  others pure corn . one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before  singin  in the rain  . he is definately one of the all time greats . it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films  especially in kelly  s characters  the only main difference being that one is based in paris  the other in l . a .  br    br   some have said that leslie caron  s acting was less than pure . perhaps cyd charisse  who was originally intended for the role could have done better  however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly . oscar levant  s short role in this film gave it just what it needed  someone who doesn  t look like gene kelly . filling the role as the everyman isn  t an easy task  yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead .  br    br   the song and dance routines are all perfection . even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without . seeing that there really wasn  t much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable  minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you  d spent four hours with them . ingenious   br    br   i would have to rate this film up with singin  since it is very similar in story and song . singin  would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance .  br    br   full recommendation .  br    br       stars .  
0,on the face of it  this should be a great film  a great cast  a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood  s finest behind the camera for the first time .  br    br   however  its clear why it was another  years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again . this movie fails on so many levels . in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations  it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director . not so here  the great cast is horribly under  used  none more so than the great  late john spencer  the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven  t seen in a hundred other tv movies . there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists . at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this  
1,this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie . there are many plots and turns . the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people . this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent . strong performance of sean connery and ed harris . if you liked this one dont miss  true crimes  or  the hurricane  . my wife and me gave     .  
1,an hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script . documentary hits all the beats  plot points  character arcs  seductions  moments of elation and disappointments and the allure but insane prospect of selling a script or getting an agent in hollywoodand all the fleeting  fantasy  realizing but ultimately empty rites of passage attendant to being socialized into  the system .  hotz and rice capture the moment of thinking you  re finally a player  only to find that what goes up comes down fast and in a blind  siding fashionthat for inexplicable reasons  hollywood has moved on and left you checking your heart  your dreams  and your pockets . pitch is a must  see for students in film school to taste the mind and ego  bashing gantlet that is  for most  the road that must be traveled to sell oneself and one  s projects in hollywood . if your teacher or guru has never been there  they can  t tell you what you need to prepare for this gantlet . to enter the  biz   talent is necessary but far from sufficient  
0,i hate this movie . it is a horrid movie . sean young  s character is completely unsympathetic . her performance is wooden at best . the storyline is completely predictable  and completely uninteresting . i would never recommend this film to anyone . it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see .  
0,how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up  with enough cops to run a mini  war that include such weapons as flamethrowers  you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying  thanks  to a corrupt cop .  br    br   you will never get your   ish minutes back . life is too precious to rent this movie .  br    br   i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie .  br    br   if you like justin timberlake  feel free to rent this movie . he does have a very major part in it  so fans might enjoy seeing him .  br    br   however  i believe most of his fans are young girls  who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .  
1,i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in     . after actually seeing it  however  i  m not surprised anymore . it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style  cinematography  and use of flashback to help develop joe buck  s character .  br    br   the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck  s character in such a short movie . i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness  when  provoked . the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him . i think when he looks in the mirror he  s trying to see if it  s really him that has done  or is about to do  something terrible .  br    br   i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role . otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate . anyway  this considered an all  time great for a reason .  
1,had this movie been made a few years later  i would have given it a lower score . however  for      this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today . just don  t try to compare this silent film to later silents   the industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the   th century don  t look at all like movies made in the     s and beyond .  br    br   this movie is   minutes long  about average for most films back then  and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story  the cask of amontillado . while many are familiar with the story  i won  t elaborate further as i don  t want to ruin the film . just suffice to say that it  s very creepy    
0,i don  t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the    club . they are today  s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the   th century . their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand . their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans  as well as billions of humans the world over  who don  t happen to share their bigoted  cruel  monstrous  and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen . the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth  such as the idea of  life after death  or  god  or  sin  or  the devil  is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill  so lost are they in their fantasy . sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn  t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy . however  the    club is in a class by itself . they are truly a cult . while i believe in freedom of speech  they way they spread hatred  lies  disinformation  and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits . i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way  people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all . treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country  as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion . the    club though  is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of  cult  but due to the    club  s vast wealth  conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip  they are above the law in this country . for those of you who have seen the movie  the matrix  you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes  and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them .  br    br   in less civil times  the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the    club out of town with torches and pitchforks . but in today  s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them  we have no way to rid ourselves of the    club plague .  br    br   the television ratings system and the  v  chip on tv  s should also have a rating called  r  for religion  so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape  such as presented by the    club every day all over our country  from themselves and their children .  
1,okay  first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie . so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion .  br    br   first off  bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century . if that  s what you  re looking for go somewhere else . just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy . it  s supposed to make you feel good and you  re supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished .  br    br   secondly  the acting though not  halle berry in monster  s ball  is still good . the movie doesn  t need acting like that honestly so don  t look for it . it  s a family movie . if that  s what you wanted you wouldn  t or shouldn  t even be looking into this movie honestly .  br    br   lastly  it has a really cute story . i think it  s thought out well and it  s entertaining to watch . it  s also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you  re finished . if you  re looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you .  br    br    lyndsay  
0,what a pathetic movie .  br    br   i won  t waste much time commenting about it . i  m still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on it .  br    br   let me leave it simply with  shaq has no business being an actor or singer . he is utterly without talent at both discplines . it  s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut cds .  br    br   much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no  talent that is shaq .  
1,this night listener is better than people are generally saying . it has weaknesses  and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis  no doubt  but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this . the whole thing feels like one of those fireside  this happened to a friend of a friend of mine  ghost stories . one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate . everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility  and real life just sort of plods alongno  so there are no flashy endings or earth  shattering revelations  no  showdown  scenes . thank heaven . you have to get into the zone when watching this movie  forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a  conventionally  good movie . williams isn  t terrific  but he easily meets the needs of the story  plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic   no one   as he is the everyman  the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story . toni collette  s performance should be nominated for an oscar  even if she maybe shouldn  t win it  . give it a shot . for quality and content alone  the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days .  
0,this is another one of those movies that could have been great . the basic premise is good  immortal cat people who kill to live  etc .  sort of a variation on the vampire concept .  br    br   the thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters . even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive  look how long it took to catch the unibomber  and that was because a family member figured it out .  br    br   by contrast  the kid  and to a lesser extent  the mom  behave as though they  re untouchable . the kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness . how these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable  let alone decades or centuries .  br    br   it  s really a shame  this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly  i . e .  giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long .  br    br   other than that  not a bad showing . i loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house  every time i put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before  i think of that scene .  
0,the british claymation series putting  witty  conversations taped from  average  people in the mouths of  cute  fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non  british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn  t get on u . s . television . someone made the mistake of putting it on u . s . television .  br    br   sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit  com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts didn  t  translate  from british english to american english  what seemed droll and cultured  and just a bit dull  in england  comes across in creature comforts  the american version  as simply boredom with puppets . there  s no through plot  line  no characters and after one and a half episodes watched  of the three ultimately aired   no reason to suffer through more .  br    br   the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set  up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule  the new adventures of old christine  or  how to be a horrible mother  or person  in one interminable  unfunny lesson    kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show  and the adults could wait to tune in until  pm when  two and a half men   guilty pleasure  and  how i met your mother   actual quality writing  come on .  
1,just re  saw this movie after thirty seven years . i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue . in      i thought where it  s at  was a very good movie . now  however  after almost forty years  it  s not as good as it was . times have changed  and this movie is now a tired old re  hash of the war between the generations . it did however  catch a place in time which is just a memory . it  s really interesting to see the mod fashions  the old vegas  a slim don rickles  chain smoking  and a hip opening song . the acting was decent  the script somewhat out  dated  but the memories were still fresh . where it  s at  may not be where it  s at for you  but for me  it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane .  
0,this type of plot really does have a lot of potential  but it was butchered here . honestly  i sensed the cheese element in the beginning  but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . whoa  i was wrong  so mad scientist makes a monster  wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them  but of course they escape . after that  it  s really bad . i should  ve counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage  but i most likely would have lost count .  br    br   pan down to the blood  dripping  from  severed  leg to show us how the shark  man finds the folks . i hate being spoon  fed every aspect of a horror film .  br    br   oh  and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark  man and trudging around a jungle  esqe island  there  s nothing more cheerful than a middle  aged man reciting shakespeare . . .  br    br   this is one where you  ll find yourself rooting for the monster . . . if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .  
0,the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichs which do not offer a real cross  cultural insight . the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick villages  dirt tracks in the middle of the desert  women clad in black robes and belly dancers . i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture . the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible .  br    br   the original idea might have been interesting  but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight  you should skip this movie .  
1,very entertaining  and a great cast as noted . i  d like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also  as is usually the case . worth renting if you can find it  which has proved difficult for me . also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name .  
0,the film was made in     and with world war   around  the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around .  br    br   the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of eleanor powell . the late miss powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word . she is again paired with a very young looking red skelton here . the two of them also starred in  i dood it .   br    br   moroni olsen  who  years later  was superb as the interrogating police officer in  mildred pierce  again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item . trouble is that olsen and his rogues are really the japanese spies .  br    br   bert lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o  brien .  
1,i love old burt reynolds movies . they  re funnier and better than every other movie combined . they might as well have stopped making movies after  cannonball run    but i guess how could they have known that there weren  t going to be any more good ones  man this movie  s good . burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot  and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand  looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way . burt and loni  those were the days  i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner . i sure loved that advertisement  plus there  s this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace  burty r .  is doing  and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment  i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night  if you can find this movie  rent it  and then never watch another movie again  because i tell you right now there  s no point .  
1,if you like deep purple  you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role . the story is about the most famous rock group back there in   s  strange fruits  and they decided to play together again . but  of course  there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts . jimmy nail and bill nighy are great  and song  the flame still burns  is perfect . you have to watch it .  
0,just utter trash . i  m a huge fan of the cusacks  this being the sole reason i watched this movie  but the only reason i can see for their presence was the reprise  in complete and depth less quality  their exact roles from grosse point blanc . apart from that  the films  role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose . and to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps . imitation is  apparently the highest form of flattery  but seeing as though this is nothing near grosse point blanc and in the same league as meet the  watch if your a moron  spartans in terms of political satire  lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves .  
1,this  like murder she wrote  is one of those shows  that after a stressful day at school  i sit down in front of the tv  and watch . why  because i genuinely enjoy it  and it  s a shame it  s not on the air anymore . dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan  a doctor  turned  detective  who with his son  solves murders . he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast  namely his real  life son  barry van dyke . victoria rowell is also good  but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes . i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter  but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman  and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared . this show is so entertaining  with great guest stars  it  s a bit obvious at times  like colombo  but in every episode  there is always something to chuckle about . in conclusion  a great series  with two thumbs up and a      . bethany cox  
1,i guess if a film has magic  i don  t need it to be fluid or seamless . it can skip background information  go too fast in some places  too slow in others  etc . magic in this film the scene in the library . there are many minor flaws in stanley  iris  yet they don  t detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible  the hardest to fix . both characters are smart . yet stanley can  t understand enough to function because he can  t read he can  t read because he  s had too much adventure in his childhood . iris  although well  educated  hasn  t had enough adventure and so can  t understand how to move past the u  turn her life took . in both their faults and strengths  the characters compliment each other . it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory  or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better  paying job . and while these  mysteries  are explained in the course of the story  their unfolding seems somewhat contrived . i assume no one took the time to rethink the script . even so  it  s a good moviejust imagine what de niro  fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had   
0,without wishing to be a killjoy  brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichd films i  ve ever seen  this being one of them  and camp blood being another .  br    br   the acting is terrible  the print is shoddy  and everything about this film screams  seriously  you could do better yourself  . maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap   br    br   i bought this for    but remember  you can  t put a price on   minutes of your life . you  d do well to avoid this turkey  even at a bargain basement price .  
1,i am curious  yellow   a film  in near seussical rhyme  is said right at the start to be available in two versions  yellow and blue  was one of those big art  house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal  cause  celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court . what  s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what  s revealed in the sex or nudity  the director   actor  vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it  s always more  so an intellectual expression than very lust  like  but the daring of the attempt at a pure  metafilm  while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden . who knew such things in a generally peaceful country  i . e . usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars  could be so heated  up politically  at least  that  s part of sjoman  s aim here .  br    br   like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w . r .  if not as surreal and deranged  or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci  sjoman is out to mix politics and sex  mostly politics and social strata  around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film . the two characters  lena and borje  have a hot  cold relationship in the story of the film  where lena is a  curious  socialist  wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and  trains  sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one  while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend . and as this is going on  which is by itself enough for one movie  sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film  there  s even a great bit midway through where  as if at a rock concert  title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are  negating having to use end credits   then with this there  s a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance  not just a  hey  i  m the director playing the director  bit .  br    br   at first  one might not get this structure and that i am curious  yellow  is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class  socialism  spain and franco  and once in a while we see lena  s father or bjore . but sjoman does something interesting the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes it  s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative  documentary  film  within  a  film  and even a serious interview with martin luther king  who also acts as a quasi  guru for lena . it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically  but it doesn  t feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength . his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer .  br    br   if i am curious  yellow  stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full  blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors  it isn  t entirely successful  i think  as an emotional experience . where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies  sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors . occasionally it works if only for the actors  lena nyman  mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even  and borje ahlstedt  a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena   but some   years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner  film of lena and borje since  perhaps intentionally  sjoman fills it up with clichs  borje has a girlfriend and kid  will he leave her  how will lena reconcile her father  and a heavy  handed narration from his starlet of sorts .  br    br   and yet  for whatever faults sjoman may have  ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself  i am curious  yellow  holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema  or testing what couldn  t be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage . i  d even go as far as to say it  s influential  and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time  a specific technique used  with the film rewinding towards the end  is echoed in poorer usage in funny games   and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant  garde or meta  film  making . if it  s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w . r . or last tango  it  s close behind .  
1,the sopranos             br    br   number   television show of all time  br    br   everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn  t go past a pilot episode . the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time .  br    br   james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss  tony soprano  accompanied by a stellar cast . edie falco is superb as the worrying  loving upper  middle class mother tony sirico is tremendous as a superstitious  greying consiglieri who is often very funny .  br    br   while the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of italian  americans as mafiosi  and to an extent this is undeniable  i can see so many positives from the show . the portrayal of strong family values  friendships  love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters  yes . furthermore  other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism  social inequality and injustice  homosexuality  drugs etc . this is no shallow  dull show about tough guys and violence . it has so much more . many of the issues we see on the show are very real .  br    br   the writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters  lives  which makes the whole thing more interesting .  br    br   credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini  for envisioning  television  s most complex and enigmatic character .  br    br   simply exceptional .  br    br         
0,on the surface  this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation  that is how to become a true self by embracing the so  called  dark  side of human nature . thus  we have the darkling  a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company  that is  recognition  of men  and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled  more or less successfully .  br    br   however  if we dig a little deeper  we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person  in the opening scene  the main character  male car mechanic fallen from grace  is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter  when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl . lesson    cars are persons embodied with immortal souls  and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery . the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished .  just after that  another character  rubin  buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once  lost  now  found famous race  car and is warned by the salesman . lesson    just like any other person  a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced . in addition  there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk  but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin  s own personal greed for more profit . lesson    thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only  but always as an end in itself .  then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and  more importantly  rubin  s car the main character  s assessment of the car  s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance  but also by a thorough look inside the engine room . lesson    a car is not just to be judged by its looks  it is what is inside that really counts . there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind  as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector  s car . this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson   .  br    br   there are numerous other examples in the movie of the  carperson   theme  and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them  but the point remains  and i guess this is what i  m really trying to say  that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do  or  if you  re a car devotee .  
1,this hard  hitting  often violent western in the peckinpah  leone tradition is surprisingly directed by andrew v . mclaglen  whose previous westerns  particularly those that starred john wayne  were mainly in the john ford mode . it is both surprisingly traditional  good guys  bad guys  and incredible up  to  date as well .  br    br   heston portrays a former captain of the arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year  having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reform  minded sheriff  michael parks  and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos  telegraphs  telephones  and the railroad in the first years of the   th century . but soon he is confronted with a menace from his past   a half  breed outlaw  coburn  that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards . in a subsequent shootout  coburn  s wife was killed and so coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge . it involves the kidnapping and  eventually  the rape of heston  s daughter  hershey  by him and his gang . the result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern arizona .  br    br   the last hard men  based on brian garfield  s novel  gun down   is violent in many places  including the showdown between heston and coburn  and the rape scene involving hershey and two members of coburn  s gang  quade  paull  is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in straw dogs and deliverance . but that doesn  t detract too terribly much from the film  s psychological approach to the western genre . mclaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache  and heston  s performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his     s films . coburn makes for an especially cold  blooded heavy  and both parks and chris mitchum  as hershey  s intended husband  do good turns as well . the music here is cribbed from jerry goldsmith  s scores to    rifles and the     remake of stagecoach  but it still works here .  br    br   wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern arizona  and utilizing the old tucson set  the last hard men needs to be released by fox on vhs and  or dvd soon . it is a western that deserves nothing less .  
1,     is in many ways a  lost year  in motion pictures . just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre  sound was coming in and  while reaping great profits at the box office  was setting the art of film  making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology .  br    br    show people  is one of the great silent era comedies . the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him  learns his lesson  and then redeems himself by winning the football game  the polo game  etc . this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane . she had excellent comic instincts and timing . this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies  like adventure of peggy pepper  marion davies  and her father  general marmaduke oldfish pepper  fresh from the old south . general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress . while at the studio commissary  the peppers run into billy boone  william haines   a slapstick comedian . he gets peggy an acting job . she  s unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick  but she perseveres . eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles . soon the new  found fame goes to her head  and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man  whom she doesn  t really love  unless fate somehow intervenes .  br    br   one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent  era films and in its early sound  era films is feature shots of how film  making was done at mgm circa     . this film is one of those  as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy  s autograph  an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself  and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot . peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn  t care for her . truly a delight from start to finish  this is a silent that is definitely worth your while . this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible .  
1,this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw it .  br    br   my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in    . i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairs .  br    br   she was saying something like  don  t let her get me  or something like that . i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she  d been watching the woman in black .  br    br   so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me . it scared the s out of me . i  ve been immune to horror films since watching this   
1,the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault  with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in      this film is a sweet  enchanting masterpiece from disney .  br    br   the film has a great soundtrack that  s one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack  and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic  so this is love .  i love the mice from the film too  they are cute . my favorite scene is the scene after the narration  the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when cinderella  s animal friends  the mice and birds  fix up cinderella  s birth  mother  s dress  so she could go to the ball . . . until drizella  anastasia tore it to bits  the bes   
0,this   minute documentary buuel made in the early      s about one of spain  s poorest regions is  in my opinion  one of his weakest films . first  let  s admit that   years later  spain is much richer than it was then  and when i say this  i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own  like excessive individualism and consumerism  though all in all wealth it  s a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here  . and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buuel favored  but with western european style capitalism . but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene  the narrator chides that in school  children are taught the value of pi . teaching math to poor people  the horror  . buuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here  not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation . what is he proposing  that children are taught exactly what at school  doesn  t buuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people   
0,this movie was extremely boring . it should least not more than   minutes . the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing .  br    br   usually i don  t write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments . i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title .  br    br   what more can i say  i fall asleep during this movie  times . it was about  hours after i had woken up from  hours long sleeping period . i think it is the point itself .  br    br   there is no dialog between characters except maybe  sentences at the very end .  br    br   when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again .  
1,life  s going not to badly for harry mitchell  he  s an ex  air force major  plus nifty little pension i imagine   who  s raking in the cash for a patent he  s developed  fusing titanium and steel via explosive process  creating super metal fit for nasa   and his wife of twenty  odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick . he  s got a nice little pad in la . i like to see visions of the   s consumer dream  and you get a good slice here  what with the restored silver jag  a series  e  type roadster  for him  and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her  as well as i  m sure other trinkets and boys toys  . there  s always got to be more though hasn  t there  so harry let  s himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans  you  re only as old as the woman you  re feeling  . as in many films noir  one mistake  in an otherwise blotch  less life  leads to a downwards arc for harry .  br    br   three blackmailers leech onto him . these are where the value are for me  great character actors playing very believable roles . bobby shy  played by clarence williams iii  is a black ex  con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double  crossers . he  s reminiscent of pluto  the vicious black ex  con psychopath from carl franklin  s well  regarded neo  noir  one false move        . there  s a similar character motivation i believe . both men have had enough of the man  and well pretty much everyone  in extremis . robert trebor plays leo franks  a fat lily  livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at    for half an hour  and    for a whole hour  did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount   . he  s in over his head  and it  s great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat  believable breakdown . john glover wins as alan raimy  who is the brains of the plot  an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui . he  s a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie  including what i believe is a pretty well  implied rape  pay attention to his rap sheet readout  it  s easily missed  and read between the lines for the motel scene with  slim   .  br    br   in common with one false move  though not exclusively  i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence .  br    br   so far so good but i think there  s a real problem with the film . harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his  tit in the wringer  . my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider . roy scheider protagonists never lose  they  re self  sure and smooth  but not in an annoying way . i feel i  m being asked to believe that his character is in peril  the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didn  t believe it . for me it  s like being asked to believe that sandra bullock  s character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama  or stephen seagal  s character is going to get taken down by the baddies  did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value  . roy scheider doesn  t convince as an adulterer either  you don  t feel any annoyance with him at all  his character is teflon  coated .  br    br   it also felt like a movie that took some cuts . at    minutes it still feels underdeveloped harry  s wife  ann margaret  is pretty much a cardboard cutout  an extension of harry  her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention . the effect that the affair has on harry  s marriage isn  t properly communicated . this could be a frankenheimer problem  he  s not known for character development . i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs .  br    br   there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film  but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better  no disrespect to the great roy scheider  . the film felt short  even with the long running time  and i think could have taken some more fleshing out .  br    br   but you really can  t forget the sleaze  like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour .  
0,daraar got off to a pretty good start . the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next . other than that  the first half of the movie is a total bore . all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla . by the way  don  t you think he  s a little old for her     br    br   things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he  he was an over  protective  neat  freak with a really hot temper  he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason  one of the reasons i really don  t like this movie is because i can  t stand to see juhi  my favorite actress  get so abused . this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening     br    br   anyway  all i  m trying to say is if you  re thinking about renting daraar  you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else   
1,i wasn  t expecting much  and  to be honest  i didn  t like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that it  s kinda cool . sure  it  s a one joke film but it  s a funny gag .  br    br   someone posted that it could be better written and it could be . i think this film had the potential to be a over  the  top my cousin vinny . but with a horror host instead of a lawyer . sadly it  s a wasted opportunity . with just a bit more writing it could be a classic . the kids are underused there  s no reason why they should latch on to elvira . apart from the obvious reasons . it would have been great to see their relationship flourish . i know it  s a comedy but it  s little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant .  br    br   elvira herself is always fun and engaging . not to mention flirty . every time she smiles you will too . it  s hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming . and it really is her charm  don  t let her looks fool you into thinking that she  s some sort of tart . well she is . but she  s a nice one . the sort of person you  d let look after your kids . wouldn  t let her cook for them  though . . .  br    br   i  d recommend giving it a go .  br    br   just don  t expect too much .  br    br   she  s more than just a great set of boobs . she  s also an incredible pair of legs .  
1,james cagney is best known for his tough characters  and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot  soft  characters in his career . this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in .  br    br   cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing . and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it . he plays the role with a lot of confidence . he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time  so it actually isn  t a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career . he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in .  br    br   the movie is directed by lloyd bacon  who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre . his earliest     s musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as    nd street  . his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really .     s musicals never were really about its singing  this was something that more featured in     s and later made musicals  mainly from the mgm studios .  br    br   as usual it has a light and simple story  set in the musical world  that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way . it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch . so do the characters and actors that are portraying them . sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie  when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines .  br    br   the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done  even though i  m not a too big fan of the genre itself . once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty . he often played little boys  babies  mice and whatever more early on in his career  including the movie musical  gold diggers of       of one year earlier .  br    br   a recommendable early genre movie .  br    br        
0,i expected this to be a lot better . i love tim burton  s work  so i was really excited to see these online short films . well  they weren  t at all what i had expected .  br    br   i don  t really know what exactly it is i don  t like . i guess they  re just sort of dull . the sound bothers me  and most of the characters  although i loved roy the toxic boy  and stainboy .  br    br   the match girl episode probably bugged me the most  although it was pretty funny .  br    br   i also don  t like the way some of the characters die . like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire  or how the girl who stares died  in general . roy  s death was amusing  surprisingly . death by a car freshener . very original    that made me laugh so hard . . .  br    br   there are some things that aren  t appropriate for kids . just some language and gore . that  s about all i have to say       
0,near the closing stages of baby mama  one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it  was all just a mess   i really couldn  t say it any better than that . and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again  the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone  s time . a lacklustre cast  mundane script and vague  caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn  t taxing on the ol  noggin  but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour . consisting mainly of very routine  clich jokes based around an odd couple  rich and poor  trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world  the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic .  br    br   as a story on finding love  it  s not that bad  but playing this plot line as a side  story of sorts to work alongside the comedy  orientated odd couple tangent  characterisation is notably weak  resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles . as characters themselves  both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces  but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character  s interactions with each other amusing at times  the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don  t feel for the characters and don  t find them inherently interesting  but rather their dynamic . unfortunately however  although this dynamic works best  or at least better than the individual personas  as mentioned above  it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd  couple formula .  br    br   kate  tina fey  is a successful business woman who has hired working class  dumb  blonde angie  amy poehler  to be her unlikely surrogate  and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl  dax shepard   both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences . yes  it  s the typical odd  couple premise  and one that we have already seen in this year  s what happens in vegas  yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi  layered characters . kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air . in fact  the movie  s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door  man . of the few times that i laughed during baby mama  most of those moments were because of this man  and the remainder usually fell to shepard .  br    br   it  s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script  s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera  and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough . yet  for a film about babies  multi  million dollar business and cultural stereotyping  this isn  t necessarily a good thing . baby mama is grade  a  hammy  plastic tinsel  town with capital bore topped with sugar . so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two  dimensional nature  but i simply didn  t care for the world they inhabited . the dialogue  along with sets  costumes  and the script  s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director  s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren  t characters and that isn  t our world in any way so why should i care  at the end of the day however  a romantic comedy  s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests  and the frequency of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these departments . of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair . i  m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings  but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored . in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable  but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch  baby mama is too light  headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining .  br    br    a review by jamie robert ward  http   www . invocus . net   
0,this rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of john woo  s talents . the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable . unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget  check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me  . nonetheless  it  s worth seeing  especially if you can catch in letterboxed .  
0,i went to school with jeremy earl  that is how i heard of this movie  i don  t really know if it was in the theater  s at all . i don  t recall the name . i have seen it  it is like one of those after school specials . the acting is ok  not great . the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny . so the only comment i can give this movie is  eh  i borrowed the movie from jeremy  if i was in a movie rental place  this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn  t recommend it to anyone past middle school age . i  ve also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed  the slang is overused or just outdated . many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable .  
1,ahista ahista is one little small brilliant . i started watching it  and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new . but as the film went on  i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film  the fantastic writing and the charming romance . the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guy  s life . there  s one very good reason the film got this feel  and it  s the fresh talent called abhay deol . he is extremely convincing as the simple  kind  hearted and struggling ankush  whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life . throughout the film  he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster  but also as a helping and loving person  who  like anyone else will do anything to protect his love . deol portrays all the different shades of his character  whether positive or negative  naturally and with complete ease .  br    br   shivam nair  s direction is very good . his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent  but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankush  s relationships with the different people who surround him  including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for . i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friend  s loud and plump mother whom he calls  khala   aunty  . he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion  yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother  figure to him as evidenced in several scenes . except for abhay  the rest of the cast performed well . though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me  she was good and had some of her mother  s charm . the actors who played ankush  s friends were very good as was the actress who played ankush  s  khala  .  br    br   apart from the performances  the film  s writing was outstanding . the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant  and the script was also fantastic . that  s mainly because despite a not  so  new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger  than  life . the film  s biggest weakness was himesh reshammiya  s uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film . otherwise  ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene . the concept may not be new  but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by . the ending was bittersweet  kind of sad yet optimistic . in short  this movie really grows on you slowly  and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing  the moving moments  the charming romance  the realistic proceedings  and of course abhay deol  s memorable performance .  
0,heather graham couldn  t play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it . who do the producers of the movie think they are  the absolute worst  most unrealistic movie i  ve seen in as long as i can remember . this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign  up on imdb and make sure the rating of this  film  drops .  br    br   omg i  m heather graham  i just kissed a drunk chick  so while she  s passed out i  m really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically  what have i done    . . jesus heather  get over it and grow up . . . and i  d like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers . . . and while i  m at it  instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story  perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who  s mentally unstable . . . like your so  called  lesbian  character . . . after all  i know the first time i had gay sex  when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street . . . honestly btch  get a grip . . .  br    br   what a joke  and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick  but i  m so sick of even thinking about it anymore . bottom line  if you  re a smart person you  ll hate this movie  and if you  re not a smart person  then you  ll love it . . . it  s as simple as that .  
0,follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit   this time the first african  american  cuba gooding  after president truman desegregates the armed forces   through the u . s . navy  s deep  sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot  robert deniro  . if the program weren  t bad enough  it  s got to be located in bayonne  new jersey .  br    br   there  s nothing wrong with the performances . robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively . cuba gooding  raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south  is the expectable paragon of rectitude . the girls   one could hardly call them women   are charleze theron and lonette mckee . they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense . other decent performers   powers boothe and hal holbrook   have even more perfunctory roles .  br    br   that  s about it . almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer . a ship is called a boat . robert de niro salutes indoors  uncovered . after a brutal assault on hospital personnel  he  s transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted . somebody shouts  i  m outta here  in the early     s .  maybe it was a common expression at the time . if so   my bad .   people address each other by rank    lieutenant    boatswain  s mate    commander   as they do in the army  whereas in the navy they are simple  mister   if an officer  or addressed by their last name  if enlisted  . i didn  t bother to check if there was a rank called  senior master chief  in     .  br    br   cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe . everyone in the navy  it seems  hates negroes except for one guy from wisconsin . he stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class . it  s like the scene in  animal house   in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh  a black man  and a blind kid .  br    br   gooding is an enlisted man  a second class petty officer . he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school . in one of their arguments she pleads with him . she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her  quit the navy  and lead a quiet life .  and just let life pass you by    he retorts . yes . yes  just be a doctor  s spouse and let life pass you by . you can wave to it from the golf course in boca raton .  br    br   these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii .  bombardier    airial gunner   that sort of thing . cheap as they often were  they had some educational features . you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner . here  the technical details are skipped over  perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them  except boyle  s law  which we learned in high  school chemistry  .  br    br   i couldn  t follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn  t exist . if i got the mechanical problems right  it was because i guessed correctly . the direction is no help either . the movie abounds in close ups  so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had . and the emergencies are confusing because they  re ill focused .  br    br   why go on  want to see a better example of this kind of movie  almost any will do   except maybe  g . i . jane   in which the abused hero is a heroin . try the training camp scenes in  the young lions .  there the victim is a jew . or try  from here to eternity   in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on  just like  cool hand luke .  no easy excuses are offered  because easy excuses are too easy .  br    br   thoroughly formulaic  and not well done .  
0,i actually paid to see this movie in the theater .  br    br   it would get a   rating  but the fight scenes between the robots are okay  and there  s a surprise .  br    br   i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others . i don  t have a problem with that . unfortunately  science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons . but  one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap . i mean  couldn  t they even make it  look  good   br    br   the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect  i might just enjoy it for the cheese  factor  but at the time  i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being .  br    br   thankfully  the experience was over in only   minutes .  
1,while not as famous as some of their other collaborations  such as the black cat and the body snatcher   this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd . boris karloff plays dr . janos rukh  a weird scientist who lives in the carpathian mountains   near where the dracula character  s home town . bela lugosi plays dr . benet   whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds french . i really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles  as the carpathian role seems tailor made for lugosi   especially with his accent . however  despite this unusual twist  the two still did excellent jobs . karloff  s was definitely the lead role  but lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person   something he didn  t play very often in films   it seems that dr . rukh is a bit of a pariah  as other scientists  especially benet  think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical . however  over the course of the film  rukh turns out to be right and benet is especially generous in his new praise for rukh . but  unfortunately  the wonderful new element that rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine  don  t you hate it when that happens   . while this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story  the plot was well constructed  the characters nicely developed and the mad rukh was not a one  dimensional killer  but complex and interesting .  br    br   this film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films . you can really tell that universal pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger  budget film instead of the cheap quickies both lugosi and karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years . good stuff .  
1,this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into  groups . . those who get the joke and those who don  t . people usually attack what they don  t understand . this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since . it  s a great comedy . . and a great romance . it  s a perfect date movie . a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh . and if your perspective is too tense  maybe this movie isn  t for you  and you may need counseling . it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early    s  having never seen the light of day on dvd . yet they feel an urban version of  the honeymooners  is a good idea . i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd . the other being gene wilder  s  the world  s greatest lover  which fox has sat on since the early    s as well . . . yet   from justin to kelly  is in nearly every video store in the country . there is no justice in the world . maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy  from justin to kelly   i  m sure that one is watered enough for them to  get  . sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor . . . or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of  full house  .  
1,  pet sematary  is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title . the story follows the creeds  an all american  middle  class family  who move into a house out in the country . the family consists of louis and rachel  and their two young children  ellie and their toddler son  gage . the house couldn  t be better  and the family meets a strange but friendly old man  jud  who lives across the road . he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies  filled with a huge amount of animal graves . and just beyond there  lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power . when the family cat  church  is killed  louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery  and strangely enough  soon after  church returns to life . but there  s something evil about him now  he isn  t the same cat he used to be . and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage  louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son . . . unfortunately  he gets more than he bargained for .  br    br   having read stephen king  s novel  i can say that the book is much better than the film . not to say the movie is bad  because it isn  t  the book is just a little bit better . the real strength in this film lies in it  s story  which is both bizarre but extremely original  something that king  s stories are typically known for . the script is very well adapted from the story  and while it minorly differs in some aspects  it  s a pretty good page  to  screen transformation . there are a few plot holes here and there  nothing major though . besides that  this movie is actually pretty scary  and it succeeds in it  s intention to do so . there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film  and i  d have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel  s sister zelda is the number one . honestly  that is one of the most disgusting  disturbing things i  ve ever seen in a horror film  it  s not gory and bloody  it  s just flat out sickening . one thing  s for sure  that image won  t leave your head anytime soon .  br    br   the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there . this film is actually on the gory side  there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there  including the shocker of an ending . i really liked the way they ended the film  it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive  but it worked better that way with all things considered .  br    br   overall   pet sematary  is a good horror movie that i  d recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general . the story is the film  s greatest asset and it  s a creepy one too . one of the better stephen king adaptations i  d say .     .  
1,this one and  her pilgrim soul  are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series  there  s something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it  s a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling  s version . however  this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do  the lovers can never unite . i remember i wasn  t surprised by the korean movie  il mare   later remade into  the lake house  . i think it  s because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .  
1,the main reason to see this film is warren william  who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager . he is electric  constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters . william is a great actor   i feel he never got his due . bette davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under  written role . personally  i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame  brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public . he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person . i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non  character . the story itself is implausible  silly and clichd . but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching .  
0,this movie was rented by a friend . her choice is normally good . i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie . although it  br    br   was a horror movie . which i don  t prefer . but no horror came to mind while watching the movie . it was a dull   br    br   not very entertaining movie . the appearance of denise richards  br    br   was again a pleasure for the eye . but that  s it . we  the four of us   br    br   we  re a little bit disappointed . but feel free to see this movie and  br    br   judge it yourself .  
1,the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black  clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . she is beaten savagely  spun around in the chair endlessly  has her finger nails pulled  animal guts are thrown at her  hot boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a needle  really sick and nasty scene  . the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape . of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome . i have seen also  flowers of flesh and blood  which is more gory and sadistic  but less disturbing . anyway  this one is a must  see for horror fans   
0,and i repeat  please do not see this movie  this is more than a review . this is a warning . this sets the record for the worst  most effortless comedy ever made . at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays  the gags are crude and flat  but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy  and only   percent of them are right . comedy is hard  this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it  s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to  kentucky fried movie .  basically  these bozos are comparing their so  called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers . come on  i  ve seen pauly shore movies that are   times funnier than  the underground comedy movie .  here  s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named dkman . the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . that  s it . that  s the whole joke . wow . this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes . another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . and in another sketch  there  s a bag lady beauty contest  in which we  re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini  clad middle  aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . plus  making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . it  s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire . . . is truth    for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap  explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags  some of the sketches might  ve sounded funny on paper  but anybody who  s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper  it probably won  t be funny on screen . if i tell someone about a big  black  muscular gay virgin  who  s saving himself for the right man  he or she would probably laugh . but watching the premise played out on screen for about   minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low  brow comedy like this for not being funny  they  re regarded as stuck  up squares . i just saw  white chicks  recently . that  s another low  brow  politically incorrect comedy  but i laughed my head off . the most offensive thing about  the underground comedy movie  is it  s not funny  what the writers and directors don  t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn  t work . there has to be more  just think of the famous scene from  there  s something about mary   ironically  enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list  . the joke about the semen wasn  t just funny because it involved bodily fluids . there was a buildup . ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn  t go out on a date with a  loaded gun .  then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door  and he has to answer it . his date  mary  is at the door and that  s when it  s revealed that the semen is hanging off ben  s ear . in this movie  there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people  with no buildup whatsoever . as jay leno always says   this comedy thing  s not so easy  is it   keep that in mind  vince offer   cause you weren  t cut out for this genre   the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . let  s face it  nowadays it  s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective . . . but this movie shouldn  t be funny to anybody  except maybe the filmmakers themselves . as a side note  the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan  s fame in movies like  armageddon  and  the green mile .  there can  t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . all the others in the cast are either non  actors  has  been actors or b  movie stars . karen black made a good impression in  five easy pieces   but i don  t think she  s done anything of value ever since . slash was probably drugged into being in this film . gina lee nolin is nothing without  baywatch .  angelyne is the film  s biggest star  keeping in mind duncan wasn  t famous at the time   and there are still probably a ton of people who haven  t heard of her   for good reason . usually  i  m in support of extremely low  budget flicks  but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to lord this doesn  t become a cult classic  shouldn  t there be a law against distributing crap like this   
1,now  i know french inmates are unlikely to have read lovecraft  and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school  maybe as a separate subject   but how did they think something that sounds like  ftagn yog sototh  could possibly lead to any good   br    br   the movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may  if read right  get them out . as prisons go  the cell was totally unrealistic  so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things . it also moves rather slowly  which may bore people . but other than that  this is top notch horror feeling  mixing sartre  s  hell is other people  with a lovecraft  barker type of story  and doing rather successfully .  br    br   bottom line take the time to watch this . that means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else . this is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it . lessons to be learned yog is bad  almost as bad as french women .  
0,the perfect murder is foiled when a wife  played by mary ellen trainor  once the wife to director robert zemeckis  who helmed this episode   who murders her husband with a poker  has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside . . an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit  played by a deviously hideous larry drake  . she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband  s corpse . she decides to use an ax  once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman  s head  to frame the killer for her husband  s murder . santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman  s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child .  br    br   this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old  santa kills  theme while also adding the oft  used  add nauseum  woman  murders  her  husband  for  a  man  she  s  been  cheating  with routine . it  s essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac . there  s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions . not one of the show  s highlights .  
1,warning possible spoilers  but not really  keep reading  . ahhh  there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won  t have room to list them all . the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late     s cartoon stills an enchanting peres  prez  prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited  but his grunts are unmistakable  and no  one else did them   and with familiar cast names  including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts    plus teri hatcher from tv  s superman .  br    br   every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors  actresses and producers in daytime tv . peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old  fashioned  delicious farce . robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine  but feels like a gift to us in the audience . some of the cliched characters are a bit dim  but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy  especially against celeste talbert  sally field  who is the show  s perennial award  winning lead  nicknamed  america  s sweetheart  . the daytime emmies  like awards opening does introduce us to celeste  s show  the sun also sets . against all vain fears to the contrary  celeste wins again . she is overjoyed  because it  s always  such a genuine thrill    adam  did you watch  i won  well  nguh . . .  the reason for adam  s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot  and we  re instantly off on a trip with celeste  s neuroses . she cries  screeches  and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee  kathy najimi  constantly waddling after celeste  unseen through celeste  s fog of paranoia  indulges a taste for tammy faye baker  for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired .  br    br   rosie schwartz  whoopi goldberg  has seen it all before . she is the head writer of the show  and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for   years . so when celeste freaks  rosie offers to write her off the show for six months  we  ll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama .  but celeste has doubts  i thought that the dalai lama moved to la .    well  then  some other lama  fernando lamas  come on   . such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas  son of aforementioned fernando lamas  d .      .  br    br   those who can remember the economics teacher  ben stein  in ferris bueller  s day off       as he deadeningly calls the roll   bueller . bueller . bueller    will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer . other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall  in real life mr happy days and brother of penny   who  gets paid   .  million to make the command decisions  on the sun also sets  he says he definitely likes  peppy and cheap   and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon  who  s  a bitch  .  br    br   geoffrey anderson  kevin kline  is the  yummy  with  a  spoon   and he is  by the way  dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes  robert downey jr   and brought back to the same show he was canned from   years earlier . of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character  rod randall  was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago . somehow they work out the logical difficulties  and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo  choo .  br    br   celeste can now only get worse  and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps . first  her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara  but she soon degenerates into a stalker . unfortunately  she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily . geoffrey  s been promised development of his one  man play about hamlet  and he means to hold the producer to that promise .  i  m not going back to florida no  how    argues geoffrey .  you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf   and indeed  seeing geoffrey  s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious . back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room  geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as  mr loman  . he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe  and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer . now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven  the show  s new ingenue so he  s not leaving .  br    br   beautiful elizabeth shue  as laurie  rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well . but  of course  the course to true love never did run smoothly . montana moorehead  cathy moriarty  is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise  and is getting desperate for some publicity .  br    br   will her plots finally succeed  will celeste settle her nerves  or will she kill tawnee first  will the producer get mr fuzzy   you  ll just have to watch  the second half  of this utterly lovable  farcically malicious riot .  br    br   and you  ll really have to see to believe how the short  sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter . if you are not in stitches with stomach  heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face  feel free to demand your money back for the video rental . soapdish       is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again  because it  s not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines . this is very well  crafted humor  almost all of it in the writing . a draw with blazing saddles       for uproarious apoplexy value  although otherwise dissimilar . watch it and weep . a happy source for anyone  s video addiction .   out of   .  
0,ben masters   kyd thomas    dream lover      plays a sort of mike hammer character  a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . kyd makes one big mistake when he stops morgan fairchild   laura cassidy  eva bomberg    arizona summer      from getting beaten up and raped . kyd takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up  she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . by the way  kyd sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between kyd and laura . all said and done  this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only   .   and i really got ripped off   
0,i watched this on the tube last night . the actor  s involved first caught my attention . the first scenes were attention getters . some funny some sad . good character development . i felt that the latter third of the film diverged . if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching . i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together .  br    br   unfortunately i feel that it never happened . i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish    . was that the other shoe   br    br   would i recommend  no  i think not . as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated     s jive  but it was not too distracting . the ending totally turned me off .  
0,when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking  and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a clich of canadian cinema sodden lyricism married to vacant  metaphor  burdened stabs at social commentary . but whatever my own film  s failings i feel much better after seeing this . . . this . . . thing . for one thing  mine ran   minutes  not    and had more content at that every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four  five  six relentless minutes . the male lead is just incredible  a brow  beating  loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama  class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub  and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him . admittedly if he weren  t such an ahole then the third act would make even less sense  as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of  exploitation  values but it doesn  t make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper  please  in closeup until the magazine runs out . i take back what i said about autumn born  which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time . at least  i really really hope so .  
1,the  movie aimed at adults  is a rare thing these days  but moonstruck does it well  and is still a better than average movie  which is aging very well . although it  s comic moments aim lower than the rest of it  the movie has a wonderful specificity  italians in brooklyn  that isn  t used to shortchange the characters or the viewers .  i . e . mobsters never appear in acomplication . it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding  the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread . these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs . i miss these scenes . it also beautifully involves older characters . the movie takes it  s own slight  quiet path to a conclusion . there isn  t a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax . cage and cher do very nice work .  br    br   moonstruck invokes old  school  ethnic  workaday new york much like  marty  except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious .  
0,this movie was so terrible it was almost good . . . almost . we love musicals  but not this one . even with the terrible sound quality  poor cinematography  and many actors who can  t sing or dance  anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance  especially toward the end  . the character marjorie  a drunk lady  was enjoyable to watch  too .  br    br   the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music . admittadly  some of the songs  fantabulous  are pretty catchy  but not in a good way  .  br    br   open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful  we think it might be a good stage musical  with excellent actors  .  
0,the waterdance       the main character of the waterdance  played by eric stoltz  finds himself in a rehab center with some others similarly injured . and there he must face an harsh new life  confined to a wheelchair . it  s an interesting  and promising premise  but unfortunately  it fails to deploy . what ensues instead is largely hollywood schmaltz  with some interesting moments . certainly the cast  eric stoltz  william forsythe  wesley snipes  et al  is brilliant  and perform well here as one would expect  but their talents are wasted . the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another  and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable  the snipes character being the exception  . i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people  s ideas about the handicapped being  crippled  or  weak   by depicting them  for the most part  as in  your  face pricks  but it makes for an entirely annoying experience . admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through  in a way that is not softened or romanticized  which is useful  and a good idea  but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with  and that  s worth dealing with  it is not part and parcel to that that these characters must be  to varying degrees  despicable . they wouldn  t have to be disneyfied  either surely there  s a middle ground somewhere . by the film  s conclusion  the eric stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person  but since he is such a flaming narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end  we couldn  t care less .  br    br   in addition to its character problems  the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from the syndrome doesn  t really have an official name  but you might call it  inexplicable forgiveness syndrome  . it goes something like this characters abuse the crap out of each other  and then without so much as an apology  all is forgiven  an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club  in which one character spends most of the film verbally bullying everybody within earshot as a resultthey love him . in one of the the latest examples  spiderman   supervillain the sandman lays waste to a chunk of manhattan  then wails on spiderman for what seems like about   monotonous minutes before being waved off with what amounts to  bye  now   . the most egregious example of ifs in the waterdance is a sequence in which  after being called the n  word by william forsythe  s racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene  the wesley snipes character whoops it up with the same forsythe character in the next scene  as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence . again  without so much as an  oh yeah  sorry about that business back there where i  you know  called you the n  word  . it makes me wonder  do these people actually watch these movies before they release them  or do they just film them with their eyes closed  kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number  and call it a day  s work   
0,frequently voted china  s greatest film ever by chinese critics  as well as chinese film enthusiasts from the outside  and  frankly  i don  t get it at all . what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable  blandly directed and acted  with a complete shrew for a protagonist . wei wei  don  t laugh  is that shrew  a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband  yu shi  for the past several years . it is post wwii  and they live with the husband  s teenage sister  hongmei zhang  in a dilapidated home with not much money  the man had been wealthy when they married  . along comes the husband  s old best friend  wei li   who also used to be the wife  s boyfriend when they were teens . she considers running away from her husband with this man  while the husband pretty much remains oblivious  thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend . that  s the set  up  and it doesn  t go anywhere you wouldn  t expect it to . i  ve actually seen the remake  directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian . it runs a half hour longer  and is actually kind of dull  too  but at least it was pretty . this supposed classic is pretty intolerable .  
1,distortion is a disturbing  haunting film  about life imitating art and art reflecting life . haim bouzaglo  the director of the film  plays the role of haim bouzaglo  artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright  who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend  s documentary . as an arab suicide bomber  disguised in skullcap and american t  shirt  wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves  haim transcribes his girl friend  s life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors  lives during rehearsals . but the bomber has already struck and haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier . despite the manipulation of time and space  the story is crystal clear  comprehensive and absorbing  a brilliant commentary on the  distortion  of everyday israeli life  where the political is intertwined with the personal  where everyone lives  on the edge   and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else  s dramatic narrative .  br    br   bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else  s production brilliantly . we are always voyeurs  seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the  real  director chooses to reveal . to remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy  bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom  sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop   and repeatedly frames his views within tv  video  or security screens . actors play the role of actors who represent the  real  characters played by actors . of course  each of the actors is the star of his or her own production  only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor  s personal films . the detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play . the actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for  tips  on how to play the role  is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes  and they attend a cast party as their real selves .  br    br   despite this multiplicity of views  there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative the playwright searches for subject matter  the bomber seeks a target  and the detective stalks the filmmaker . nor is there any difficulty locating bouzaglo  s ultimate targetenervated and impotent israel  fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action . israel is bouzaglo  the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play . israel is also the bankrupt soldier  entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker  s documentary  the cheating actors and actresses  and the cuckolded husband . they are all israel because they are all helpless  caught in inaction or aimless action  as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target . all the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep  score  of victims .  br    br   there is personal triumph  vindication  perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film  but viewers will be left aching for the state of israel even as they are filled with admiration for bouzaglo  s memorable rendition of a nation  s plight within the telling of an individual  s story .  
1,many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost . the feelings of pain  grief and sorrow can be unbearable . however  sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions . this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film  tulip   directed by the award winning australian actress  rachel griffths . described as a movie  as much about memories as it is about love   a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant   minute film .  br    br    tulip  is a beautifully wrought  touching and heart  warming story of a man  s journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal   tulip  . the film opens with a rising dawn  the chirping of birds and a vast landscape  introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film . a soft music plays  marking the entrance of ruth  jean bain  . she wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head . she gently pets tulip  caressing her ears and patting her back . the furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable  a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench   reflecting the peaceful rural community . will  charles  bud  tingwell  greets ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket . they pour the milk and coffee together  a sign of companionship and teamwork . not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate they paint a perfect picture of happiness .  br    br   sadly  happiness doesn  t last forever . the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply . an effective scene of fading cars highlights will  s isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral . soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost . at will  s moment of despair  tulip becomes the symbol of ruth  the genuine connection will has with his late wife . it was through tulip that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness .  br    br   each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed  especially the part of will . charles  bud  tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment . the recent loss of his own wife  audrey tingwell  is effectively reflected in his acting . every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character . the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean bain . although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie  her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious . lois ramsey and kati edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary . they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story .  br    br   an anecdote from griffths  childhood  the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in  tulip  . beautifully shot and superbly acted  this film will surely make you misty eyed  triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk .  
0,this horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist  sexist and homophobic all at once  while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated . atrocious performances  a cliche ridden screenplay  and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of . two scenes were especially offensive  the one in which schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man  could it really have been that gross   and the scene where eastwood is kissed by schaech  s best friend  who is pretending to be russian . after he leaves the room she exclaims  fking foreigners   so much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in paris     br    br   jonathon schaech can be a likeable actor on screen  and is astonishingly good  looking . it  s a shame he didn  t learn more from working with cutting edge gay director gregg araki on an earlier film  and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia .  
1,i am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the columbine massacre . there isn  t a major documentary  very puzzling . fortunately we are graced with the talent of ben coccio who directed zero day  and gus van sant who did the equally fine elephant . two different takes on the event  which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery  that there  s something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers  and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality . zero day  purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event  is absolutely riveting . even if you know where it  s going  you still harbor hope that it won  t  go there  . . . and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating . the film is terrific from top to bottom  from director to script  not much improvised  though it appears very spontaneous  to the two lead actors  and the supporting players as well . there is only one aspect of zero day that troubled me . okay  so we can  t fathom why the shooters would do what they did  but certainly one of the contributors was their anger . yet these boys don  t really seem angry . they may say some things to indicate that they are  but in fact they didn  t convince me that they had something inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people . but this still leaves me with the sense of  why     that director coccio wants me to have . anyway  rent or buy this movie  it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time . the blair witch folks could only wish for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary .  
1,i saw this film at the toronto international film festival . not as salacious as it sounds  this is a three  part documentary  each episode is   minutes  featuring slovenian superstar philosopher  psychoanalyst slavoj zizek . zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films  exploring themes of sexuality  fantasy  morality and mortality . it was directed by sophie fiennes  of the multi  talented fiennes clan  she  s sister to actors ralph and joseph  .  br    br   i enjoyed this quite a bit  although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd  since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested . freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours . it didn  t help that an ill  advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so .  br    br   my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes . he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch  not exactly masters of subtlety . i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films  although that  s really just me saying i  d like to see part four and five and six .  br    br   zizek is very funny  and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he  s discussing . so  for instance  we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay  from hitchcock  s the birds  or sitting in the basement of the bates motel  from psycho  . which is not to say that his theories are not provocative . even when i found myself disagreeing with him  it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films . which is exactly what he  s trying to accomplish .  
1,edmund burke said that  all evil needs is for good me to do nothing .  hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films . this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith . it had no violence  no lewdness  and did not deserve a pg rating . the western scenery was filmed well  and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking . actors were a bit young for their parts  but otherwise believable and talented . music score was too loud  and in some places drowned out the dialog completely . i  m seldom surprised by movie endings any more  but i was pleasantly surprised by this one . sometimes the good guys do win  and they win by honest efforts . we liked the movie and the message  and would recommend it for the entire family .  
1,chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos . unfaltering performances  rock  solid writing  and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever .  br    br   all of the cast are strong  but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy  s . anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons . james gandolfini is absolutely fierce  absolutely terrifying  and you still find yourself loving him  mesmerized by him .  br    br   many people that i  ve spoken to about the sopranos  who haven  t seen it yet  will say  i  m just not a fan of mafia movies  shows  . whatever . run  don  t walk  and get it . those same people usually love  e . r .   but i bet they don  t much care for hospitals . . . it  s not about the context .  
1,this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie . the acting is excellent considering the script  the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding . the gore is well done and used sparingly  look out for the excellent barbed  wire death   the action is punchy when used . it  s true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times  but compared to other movies on the same  or bigger   budget  it  s hardly noticeable at all . overall  this is recommended . trust me  it  s better than it appears       
0,i think i will make a movie next weekend . oh wait  i  m working . . oh i  m sure i can fit it in . it looks like whoever made this film fit it in . i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked    it looks like someones home movie and i don  t think more than     was spent making it    total crap    who let  s this stuff be released        
0,well  it  s robin hood as  geezer  all right . . . just as advertised  that didn  t sound very hopeful  and alas  it was worse than i  d suspected .  br    br   a laddish robin i can take a robin who tangles with a pert dyer  s daughter i can credit but a robin who exchanges not  very  funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow  and a robin and entire cast who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom . how could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re  shooting the scenes  again and again  much sounds as if he  s struggling with half  comprehended shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip i hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick  but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast .  br    br   whatever else you say about errol flynn in the role  he had the knack of delivering high  flown dialogue as naturally as if he  d just thought it up on the spur of the moment . . . and as this production shows  that  s not at all as easy as it sounds  if they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies  the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines they sound as if they haven  t a clue how to handle them .  br    br   i  m afraid i didn  t even like the pantomime sheriff  for a similar reason the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered  and in this case written  with a nudge and a wink at the audience . they  re out of place all right   fourth  wall  busting stuff   but really not that funny .  br    br   this much  promised production reminded me of a limping school play . the only actor and character i felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing guy of gisbourne  who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on  a  credible villainy and  b  credible characterisation   but frankly  i wouldn  t have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series  as of the time of writing  i  ll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week  with less stilted scene  setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue after all  the opening episode of  doctor who  wasn  t exactly a show  stopper  though it was nowhere near as bad as this . but if i see no improvement after episode   i  m afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer .  br    br   which would be a pity  because i  ve got a soft spot for the  robin hood  legend on screen  from the adventures of douglas fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of richard greene . but this robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest .  
1,this is where the term  classic film  comes from . this is a wonderful story of a woman  s bravery  courage and extreme loyalty . poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband  who through the years learned to appreciate her .  yeah right  a pearl     br    br   luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role  and what a waste of an oscar  in  the great zigfield  . it really didn  t show what  if any  talent she had other than her exotic beauty . but in  good earth  she shows that she can really act  her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either . people say that she didn  t show any real emotions in this film . like hell . her character olan is a shy and timid woman  with inner strength . she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions . example those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot . if you people are saying that she doesn  t act well in this film  you are not looking   br    br   paul muni shows that he can act as well . his character is not a likeable one to me . he never sees her for what she is  until the very end of the story . a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother  with her own special beauty . the greatest one of all  the beauty from within  like a pearl .  br    br   if you get a chance to see this film  watch it . you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created .  
1,little edie and big edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for . even though their house was filthy  this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness . on the message board a poster wrote that  little edie has the coping skills of an eight year old .  this reminded me of when in the dramatized     version  big edie says to little edie   if you  re stuck  it  s only with yourself   these women had everything beauty  talent  intelligence  firm belief in their opinions and actions . perhaps if little edie wasn  t so hard on herself the first time things didn  t work out  losing her hair  her job  and the love of her life  she would have made it . this somehow ties into what i believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead . the world will never know what have happened if she didn  t listen to her mom  s plea   come home  edie  let me take care of you    br    br   yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant  heartbreaking  and lovable  even in their extremely filthy home . these women were extraordinary  and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness . when edie had one of her emotional breakdowns  dwelling about what could have been  or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl  one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that  everything will be okay    br    br   great documentary    br    br        
1,as this happens to be one of most favorite novels  i was very excited to see the move . i was not disappointed  yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on  but i think that the movie stuck true to the book  and was a really good movie . it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review  but this is one of the good ones . it is such a dark story  which i guess is why i like it . . and what is better than the dead coming to life . . and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too . if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book   it is a well written screen play  the actors could have done a better job  i only say this for rachel  and ellie . . she was so whinny  i liked everyone else a lot . . and most important to me . . it stuck true with the novel .  
0,possible spoilers  perhaps . i must say that  cinderella ii dreams come true  is one of the worst movies ever made . first of all  the movie was made during the height of disney  s sequel rampage . it was created around the same time as  the little mermaid ii    the jungle book ii   and  peter pan ii   all of which were disservices to their original film classics .  disney also made  the hunchback of notre dame ii  and  atlantis ii   but i  m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place .   let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films  and i absolutely adore the original disney  cinderella .  the sequel to  cinderella   however  was a waste of time . the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching . in the original  cinderella was kind and loving . the new cinderella had very out  of  character moments with current  era phrasing like   i  m going to do this banquet my way   let me also tell you that new cinderella  as i have affectionately named her  says   ewww   that is the anti  cinderella . i try to find the best in people  but in the sequel  anastasia  one of the stepsisters  is good  what the heck  why  they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia . my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original  cinderella  when making this sequel  well  it surely doesn  t seem so . if i remember correctly  anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine . i am all for redemption and forgiveness  but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie . in the first one  anastasia was evil . in the second one  she is good . one just can  t leave a story like this . i hope disney realizes that this movie  among other movies  is shaming walt disney  s name . perhaps now that michael eisner is gone  things will start shaping up around the house of mouse .  
1,remember the early days of pay per view  i do  and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t . v . as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy  but this meant actually calling someone from ppv and asking to rent it . and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap . well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv . and i remember almost every scene that was in the add . i  ve been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them . it  s one that when its on its hard to shut off . all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right . there are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category . it has enough action and laughs to sustain it . check it out if you dare   
1,spoilers  classic    s sex trash  the swedish gal  helga  was what made this movie so great . she was beautiful  but what really got to me was how sexual she was . she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film . her best scenes were when she was  er  stimulating herself . whenever she was on screen  i became transfixed .  br    br   also  the doctor julia  sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film  was very interesting visually . although most   year old girls have bigger breasts than julia  she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes  especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt  also grabbed my attention unmercilessly . you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid i don  t know if i  ve ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time . classic stuff   
1,this was a typical grade b movie in     s hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations . why  it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch  george macready and dame may witty  as a female villain  of all people .  br    br   when a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary  she certainly gets more than she bargained for . the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise . seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter  in  law and wife  respectively . macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be claimed .  br    br   the film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does . why don  t people believe her   
1,what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock  it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously .  br    br   hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time . something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years . this is a thriller  but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera .  br    br   rachel mcadams is wonderful as always . cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins . in the old days  there were guys who always played the bad guy . we don  t see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move  but cillian murphy is really good at being bad .  br    br   the directing is surprising stylish . the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up .  br    br    red eye  is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling . if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller   red eye  might be your ticket .  
0,much has been written about purple rain  the apparent  quin  essential  musician bio movie  however i  m here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it  s high praise .  br    br   first of all let  s get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels . even the score is mesmerising  and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it  s not and as such the movie has some problems .  br    br   first of all is the horrendous acting  writing  prince  s character  the kid  is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere . a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments  unfortunately prince  s character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it  s hard to believe that he  d get the girl this way . everything just seems a little off here  which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that  s terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live  but we aren  t ever allowed to get inside of it .  br    br   a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert . prince and morris  s lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here  which i guess makes sense from a business perspective  but it  s exhausting to have a  hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage  especially when the character  s back stories get pushed aside for it .  br    br   so to sum it up this isn  t a very good movie .  
0,rant start i didn  t want to believe them at first  but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill . after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie  gwoemul   aka  the host   of       which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b  movie genre   successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic  even though their budgets  mainly spent on special effects  have become more and more fantastic . do south korean movie  makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill  which their industry has built up since the     break  out film  shiri  swiri   by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did  rant end  br    br   the only  reason  i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean  east asian  styled dragon i have seen to date  for the final scenes . now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the      dragonheart   the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons . remember  dungeons  dragons  in      hasn  t anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use  but how well you use it  i hope there are more  and better  korean legends they can use  because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one .  br    br   in short  i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem  arirang  being played at the very end . as a creature feature  i would have given it at least  stars out of   if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it  but i  ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting  just less dragons  .  
1,my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old . i have never forgotten it . i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor .  she was twenty  two when she made elephant walk  remember  i  m nine  so the feelings aren  t sexual  i just couldn  t see anything else on the screen . i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her . she has begun to show her age   she  s almost seventy  four  but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived .  br    br   i have seen the movie several times since  and it is a sappy melodrama . what saves it is  of course  miss taylor  s beauty  magnificent scenery  the very impressive elephant stampede  and a well  made point on human arrogance in the face of nature .  br    br   all in all  a well  spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video .  
1,i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film  and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed . it made much of the fact that the film was  by the director of cube  and made it look like a horror film  when in fact it is an absurdist comedy  imdb  s spell checker doesn  t seem to think that absurdist is a word  but it is   reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead .  br    br   i love the way the story builds up slowly at first  then gradually escalates . i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film . that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube . i recommend it .  
1,since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept  but first some insider notes from a movie critic .  br    br   this animated series is one of those that i grew up with  it made my childhood joyful  it made it awesome  miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don  t see as much as we did back in the days  well on to the review . . .  br    br   talespin  or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series  it is much like chip and dale  ducktales and a lot of those old ones  so it has that weird feeling surrounding it  i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it .  br    br   but in my opinion it was very great  it came with some kind of message  not that wild of a message  however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven .  br    br   now i don  t want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons  today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that  we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that  yet i feel like that we don  t have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days .  br    br   now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much  to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones  give me back my childhood cartoons  give them to the kids i have some day  give them again . . .  
1,no  nonsense inspector hollaway  a solid turn by john bennett  investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house . first and most mundane tale   method for murder   successful author charles hillyer  nicely played by denholm elliott  is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he  s writing about in his latest book . although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special  it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending . second and most poignant anecdote   waxworks   lonely philip grayson  the always outstanding peter cushing  and his equally lonesome friend neville rogers  the splendid joss ackland  both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful  but lethal murderess . third and most chilling vignette   sweets to the sweet   quiet  reserved and secretive widower john reid  a typically terrific christopher lee in a rare semi  sympathetic role  hires nanny ann norton  the fine nyree dawn porter  to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter jane  a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable chloe franks  . this stand  out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress franks  who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer . fourth and most amusing yarn   the cloak   pompous horror movie star paul henderson  delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by jon pertwee  purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it . this item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious ingrid pitt as enticing vampiress carla . director peter duffell  working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe robert bloch  maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere . kudos are also in order for ray parslow  s crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by michael dress . highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare .  
1,this movie is probably for you . it had an overall meditative quality from the music  to the beautiful photography  and listening to the often clich things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots . if you  re familiar with buddhism  that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film . the impermanence of life  the beauty of nature  the interconnectedness of all things  etc . however  what i did not understand  confused  and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing  i saw over an hour of it  was the redundancy of the whole thing . you only find out bits and pieces of why he  s commissioned  and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work . the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends .  
1,i love all of the movies by michael landon jr . and michael landon jr  s casting of dale midkiff as  clark davis  could not of been any better . dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this character .  br    br   this movie kept me spellbound from start to finish .  br    br   the death of missie  willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing . how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love .  br    br   although there are  movies before this one  love comes softly  loves enduring promise  loves long journey  i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily . yet leave and want to see the previous  movies due to the history all the characters have behind them .  br    br   michael landon jr . is an excellent director  br    br   i look forward to many more movies from him in the future .  
1,this is a better than average silent movie and it  s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents . however  if you aren  t yet a fan of the genre  i suggest you try a few other films before watching this one . that  s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots . but  despite this  it  s still a good film and kept my interest .  br    br   a nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him . the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief . despite this  she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life . however  the rent is due and there  s no money  so the lady is forced to look for work . she becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal . unfortunately  the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can  t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man  s date . well  like cinderella  she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her  what to do now   given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her   well  see the movie yourself to see how it  s all resolved . i didn  t like how they handled the husband  as it seemed awfully predictable and clichd . however  once he was out of the way  i do admire how the film also didn  t give up a by  the  numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends .  br    br   all in all  a very good film worth seeing  but certainly not great .  
0,you  know  i can take the blood and the sex  but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in . someone get that girl some pasta before it  s too late   br    br   and you know  it  s just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it  s ripping off .  br    br   i gave this one a   just because it  s marginally better than tobe hooper  s crocodile .  
0,revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since  in fact  most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events . unfortunately  what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom . one cares not who wins  loses  dies or lives   just end it as soon as possible . this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology . scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them . they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way . one cannot expect the amazing effects of  the house of the flying daggers  or  the golden compass   but  after all  this is a     digitally mastered production . characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene  so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms . in my view  this film turns the french revolution of the     s into the  papier  mache  revolution of a  papier colle  world .  
0,what  is jamie foxx supposed to be funny  does he really believe he is funny  well  it  s funny watching his confidence in being funny . the man has no identity whatsoever . . . i mean you can immediately see who his idols are  denzel washington and martin lawrence  because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies . the only problem is that he does it bad  uneven  and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel  with that macho  st attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence  the funny and clumsy  silly comic . there  s no personal touch to all that  i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell  and i  m sure he has nothing to say personally . he really is mr . dull  boy in person .  br    br   i was really hoping hollywood  and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom  like don cheadle for example  but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old .  
0,wow  what a total let down  the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous . the special effects were a direct rip  off of  the ring .  the story  was there one  not in my opinion . . just a bunch of flashy imaging . the entire film was a boring  stupid  mess . i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns . however  this is the worst horror film i have seen in years . and that buffy chick  well  she  s a bad actress  as plastic as barbie and just as talented . . no  wait  that would be an insult to the talents of barbie  i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg     and had it been rated r  it would have bombed imo  stupid movie   
0,antonioni  s movies have aged not well . what always surprised me about them is that  besides an unquestionable plastic beauty  there is a dull and didactic  psychology  of the characters and situations . remember  for instance  the conversations between mastroianni and the  wicked capitalistic  that wants sing up him in  la notte   or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in  la aventura   or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film .  br    br   i have reviewed yesterday  zabriskie point  . in this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the rod taylor office  the streets and highways of l . a .  the publicity advertisements  the deserts  etc .  that show the fascination of the author in his american journey  in the same way than wim wenders years later . unfortunately  there are too a lot of hippie  leftist clichs that spoil the movie  the boy leaves the meeting  steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find  something different  .  the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation .  the girl looks at the  object women  in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them .  the couple of fat middle  class in the caravan speak  in front of the beauty of the nature  of building a hotel and earning a lot of money .  last but not the least  a lot of couples making love in the desert . what a hippie platitude   br    br   sorry  today  half a century after the  revolution  of  la aventura  we can see that the king is naked  and his films  except  le amiche  and perhaps  il grido   are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces .  
0,  freddy  s dead  did the smartest thing it could  ve done after the disappointment of the fifth film . it started from scratch . sure  this  final  film in the saga is silly but at least it  s original . some of the visuals are even a bit breath  taking . and the story of freddy  s kid  lisa zane  returning to town to face her evil father is unique .  br    br   overall  the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater . it has a bunch of good actors  zane  yaphet kotto  and lezlie deane  who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter . it  s one  sided  it  s a magic  trick  and  in the end  it  s nothing but goofy  childish entertainment .  br    br    
0,i  m not a huge freddy krueger fan  but that doesn  t mean that i don  t like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies . i think that robert is a very good actor . nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does . but  no offense robert  this movie sucked . the acting is terrible  the plot is really weak  and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that  s even worth watching . sometimes sequels can be better than the first  such as the friday the   th franchise  i thought the remake was the best in the series .  but this isn  t one of those movies . the original was good  the  nd in my opinion was better  the  rd was okay but i haven  t seen the others . whatever you do  don  t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap .  
1,  the shop around the corner        is a pleasant romantic comedy  not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days  but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation . by      director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm  and his famed  lubitsch touch  had become a sparkling commercial trademark . this film was planned for a     release  but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming . rather than substituting either of his main stars  lubitsch decided to postpone production  in the meantime directing greta garbo in  ninotchka       .  when it was finally completed   the shop around the corner  appears to have been met with relative indifference  receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role . time  nevertheless  has betrayed the film  s massive and enduring influence  with high  profile remakes including  in the good old summertime        and  you  ve got mail       .   br    br   at its surface  one might assume  the shop around the corner  to simply be the story of two lovers  klara novak  sullavan  and alfred kralik  stewart   who love each other without knowing it . however  lubitsch  s film runs much deeper than that . it  s the story of matuschek and company  a stylish gift shop in budapest  and the various human relationships that make the store such a close  knit family . when store  owner hugo matuschek  frank morgan  begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife  we witness the breakdown of two families  both at home and at work . there  s absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states  perhaps in the blustery streets of new york  but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe  the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep . this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful  personal touch to the film  in fact  even as i write this review  i  m beginning to appreciate the story even more .  br    br   sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles  but i think that it  s the supporting cast that really make the film . each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix  and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable . i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek  who  in any other film  would have been restricted to an underdeveloped  two  dimensional portrayal . matuschek may have lost the love of his family  but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees  and you feel a heartwarming glow when  in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm  he finds companionship in a freckle  faced young errand  boy  charles smith  . this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder  s later creations  for example  boom boom jackson in  the fortune cookie        or carlo carlucci in  avanti        .  of course  it doesn  t really need saying  but billy wilder learned from the best .  
1, . . . . . . . . . and you get chori chori chupke chupke . don  t get me wrong  this movie is much less explicit  or not even  than pretty woman  but it  was  a new topic for bollywood . the topic was accepted but it is far from jism  murder  and julie . to tell you the truth  the topic is presented in a very clean manner . but the plot has it  s number of clichs . the beginning of the movie is presented in a very  filmi  way . there are some very little plot holes . the movie picks up once rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie . otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning . the acting couldn  t have been any better . salman khan sometimes impresses  and sometimes lets you down . over here he gave one of the best performances . on top of that his role is written so well  that you applaud every time he solves a problem . rani mukherjee was adequate . throughout the movie  you feel for her character the most  but she is overshadowed by preity zinta . preity zinta is picture perfect . out of the three  she gives everyone a run for their money . its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent . and trust me  madhubala is far from your girl next door . this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high . the supporting cast are like the family you see in hahk  where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here . the songs are pretty nice . the title song is my favorite of them all along with dil tera mera dil  hearts  . mehndi mehndi  henna  and dekhne walon ne  look at the world  s sight  are two song that fit the film perfectly . preity  s cabaret number  diwani diwani  crazy   could  ve been shortened while no .  punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing . otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch .  
1,as a kid  i loved this game . i played it a zillion times during spring     with my friend andrew . i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored . then streets of rage  came out . and we quickly forgot that this one even existed .  br    br   you play as ex  cops axel stone  adam or blaze fielding  who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way . there are  levels to work thru in a run  down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x . beating up all the bad guys and the end  of  level boss is much fun . level   the bridge  was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river . you even have the chance to become mr . x  s right hand man at the end of the game  at a price  . this leads to the  bad ending  in which you become the the boss of the syndicate . exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr . x  but never mind .  br    br   streets of rage also has truly fantastic music . the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis . the main theme  level one  level  and final boss are standout tunes .  br    br   as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console . but with streets of rage  also available  it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete .  br    br   pros  br    br   average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic  book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game .  br    br   great tunes .  br    br   easy to get into and hard to put down .  br    br   cons  br    br   vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage  .  br    br   poor enemy ai . baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat . this is especially infuriating with the level  boss .  br    br   lack of combo moves .  br    br   lack of decent weapons .  br    br   bad guy models are repeated far too often .  br    br   graphics b  sound a  gameplay b  lasting appeal b   
1,dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt  one of the most amazing shows ever produced  but not just in the field of animation . while the first part  acts  and   mostly consists of action and fun  the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part  acts   and   . i do have some complaints though . in the first part  the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .  
0,i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal  mart earlier in the week . all three children actually got physically ill while watching it . i  m pretty sure it was the pizza they ate  or something they all had picked up from school  but really it could have been this film . absolutely disgusting . how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me . fortunately  i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely . for any parents out there  i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie .  
0,well  what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation   br    br   there are some amazing actors in this  oliver reed  sarah miles  christopher plummer  but they clearly are clocking up the money .  br    br   lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics  anthony with hugh grant  who looks suitably embarrassed  and gilbert with helena bonham carter .  br    br   if you really want to see a  watchable  adaptation of cartland  the bonham carter one is the one to go for   a hazard of hearts   what a title    . gilbert is the weak link in that  but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act  and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek  edward fox  diana rigg   
0,bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day  steals the body in his fake ambulance  hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep bela  s wife eternally young . some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible  terrible mystery . bela lugosi hams it up nicely  but you can tell he needed the money .  br    br   this film is thoroughly awful  and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables  but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous . tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film . i got the dvd in a discount store  for    which i think is a pretty accurate valuation  anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind .  
0,i usually try to construct reasonably well  argued critiques of films  but i can not believe this got past the script stage . the dialogue is appalling  the acting very dodgy  the accents just awful  and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best .  br    br   i don  t remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad . joseph fiennes  pretty as he is  might just have killed his career as quickly as it started .  br    br   the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage .  
1,there is no doubt that during the decade of the   s  the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films . after being universal  s  first monster  in the seminal classic   dracula   bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent  sadly  this last factor would also led him to be type  casted during the   s  . in the same way  boris karloff  s performance in james whale  s  frankenstein  transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster . of course  it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen  and the movie that united them was      s  the black cat  . this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade  and director lambert hillyer  s mix of horror and science fiction   the invisible ray   is another of those minor classics they did in those years .  br    br   in  the invisible ray   dr . janos rukh  boris karloff  is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet  s past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda . while showing his invention to his colleagues  dr . felix benet  bela lugosi  and sir francis stevens  walter kingsford   they discover that thousands of years ago  a meteor hit in what is now nigeria . after this marvelous discovery  dr . rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa  looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor . this expedition won  t be any beneficial for rukh  as during the expedition his wife diane  frances drake  will fall in love with ronald drake  frank lawton   an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition . however  rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip  as he  ll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor .  br    br   written by john colton  who previously did the script for  werewolf of london     the invisible ray  had its roots on an original sci  fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges . given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi  colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story  playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up . one element that makes  the invisible ray  to stand out among other horror films of that era  is the way that colton plays with morality through the story . that is  there aren  t exactly heroes and villains in the classic style  but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices . in many ways   the invisible ray  is a modern tragedy about obsessions  guilt and revenge .  br    br   a seasoned director of low  budget b  movies  filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make  films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles . thanks to his experience working with limited resources  hillyer  s films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains  and  the invisible ray  was not an exception . while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films  hillyer  s movie effectively captures the essence of colton  s script  as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci  fi . finally  a word must be said about hillyer  s use of special effects for an extremely low  budget film  they look a lot better than the ones in several a  movies of the era .  br    br   as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff  the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality . as the film  s protagonist  boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes . as his colleague  dr . benet  bela luogis is simply a joy to watch  stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was . as rukh  s wife  frances drake is extremely effective  truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress . still  two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh  and beulah bondi as lady arabella  as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time  making unforgettable their supporting roles . frank lawton is also good in his role  but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast .  br    br   if one judges this movie under today  s standards  it  s very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience . however  that would be a mistake  as despite its low  budget  it is remarkably well done for its time . on the top of that  considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept  it  s ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate . one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters  specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr . rukh and the cold dr . benet  as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors .  br    br   while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the  frankenstein  movies  nor the elegant suspense of  the black cat   lambert hillyer  s  the invisible ray  is definitely a minor classic amongst universal pictures  catalog of horror films . with one of the most interesting screenplays of   s horror  this mixture of suspense  horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had boris karloff and bela lugosi .      
0,oh my god  this movie insults the intelligence of everybody . i mean really  who thinks three kids can fight   to   ninjas and win . not to mention the brainless humor thrown in . this film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad . the movie is an omen  the only thing it  s good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs .  
0,alicianne  laurel barnett  becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon  rosalione cole  who has recently lost her mother . but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave  conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house  late at night . . . where she also meets her  friends  . . .  br    br   this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery . . . then falls apart . the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film   minutes long . the acting is terrible across the board  with cole easily being the worst  . badly directed with some of the worst editing i  ve ever seen in a motion picture . scenes  and sound  are just cut off with no rhyme or reason . also the film has terrible  and obvious  post  production sound .  br    br   as for blood and violence   forget it  there  s very little and what there is looks incredibly fake . i  ve never seen such fake  looking blood   looks like ketchup  boring  pointless   a rightfully forgotten drive  in movie . you can skip this one .  
0,i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again  i wonder why . i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down . why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls  what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the confessions films but about a third of the way through  whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me lai  the film asks us to start taking it seriously . not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted . in short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend . richard o  sullivan maybe  as such a central figure  could have helped but i reckon this to be one of his worst performances . just worth it for the ladies .

1,this is a musical adaptation of dicken  s  oliver twist  . for the most part  the original story has been maintained  though for the flow of the film certain subplots  such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half  brother  are omitted . the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book  fagin is hanged   an ending very different from this musical film .  br    br   this is a one of a kind musical   one whose style and scope really hasn  t been matched before or since . not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable  but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold . whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing  here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more . it  s truly a sight to see and i was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories . having just seen it again a few moments ago  i would have to say that the film only got better over time . great sets  wonderful acting and singing   this is a special treat that is hard not to love .  br    br   by the way  when i saw the film again tonight  i was surprised by just how high and feminine mark lester  s singing was for the film . well  according to imdb  his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice .

0,this movie is easily the worst of the series . though new line might just be looking at sales  they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its  d ending . it wasn  t that the   d was good either  because it was    s  d with the red and blue lenses  anaglyph .  it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like . beyond that this movie was so poorly done  bad script  bad characters  bad acting  worse directing . this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a  looney tunes  episode .  br    br   seriously  not for horror audience  because it is corny and not scary  and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds . just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted .  br    br   i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten . this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film .  
1,spoilers herein  br    br   what really scares you  killer sharks  or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message  maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath   br    br   maybe . but those fears don  t even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider   and that is the death of one  s own child .  pet sematary  taps this base  primal adult fear  and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore .  br    br   i  ve read comments about this film that include poor acting  characters making stupid decisions  etc . i disagree . the acting is actually first rate for a film like this . maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario . but the film  s events are not only logical  they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible . this is the true horror of  pet sematary   it isn  t that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels  it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis creed does . despite warning  or even past history .  br    br   the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart . the heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect . and the results are horrifying . in fact  when the film dives into slasher territory near the end  it  s almost a letdown  although i believe it  s perfectly logical how it got there .  br    br   i am a true horror fan  and i contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made . if you don  t think so  see it again after you have children .  
0,war  inc .  corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser  john cusack  to do their wet  work against rival ceos . a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike . it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on . i kept waiting for things to make sense . there  s no reason or method to the madness .  br    br   it  s considered by cusack to be the  spiritual successor  to grosse point blank . i . e .  war is more or less a knock  off . we again see cusack as an assassin protecting spoiler the person he  s supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience . to be fair  john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease . the brief fights look good . the rest of the film does not . it  s all quirky often bordering on bizarre . war inc  s not funny enough to be a parody  and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film  s message might be  which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations  like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens . interesting  but the satire just doesn  t work because it  s not funny and at its heart the film has no heart . we  re supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack  s shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war .  br    br   john cusack gives a decent performance . his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits . marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist . there really isn  t a lot of chemistry between them . hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn  t make a fool of herself . joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out . blech . ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn  t start doling out a decent performance now and again . pathetic .  br    br   it  s not a terrible movie  but in the end you gotta ask  war  what is it good for   absolutely nothing . c   
0,the  documentary   and we use that term loosely apparently  summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world . then states that any muslim that doesn  t admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face  also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them . what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets . if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle  east i would look elsewhere . try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources .  
0,this is it . this is the one . this is the worst movie ever made . ever . it beats everything . i have never seen worse . retire the trophy and give it to these people . . . . . there  s just no comparison .  br    br   even three days after watching this  for some reason i still don  t know why  i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is  was . its so bad . so far from anything that could be considered a movie  a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence .  br    br   this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good . it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe . this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society . we should be ashamed . i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art  is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good . it  s an embarrassment . i don  t know how on earth any of these actors  writers  or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making  loaded  . i don  t know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies .  br    br   that being said  i love a good  bad  movie . i love shark attack   i love bad taste  they are hilarious . i tell all my friends to see them because they are  bad  .  br    br   but this . . . . . . . this crosses the line of  bad  into a whole new dimension . this is awkward bad . this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen  every line  every action  every death  every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before  i mean like  after watching the first  minutes before .  br    br   every cheesy editing  effect  is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point . i really never want to see the  shaky  camera  drug buzz rush  effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever . this is meticulously boring  repetitive and just tortures the audience .  br    br   but . . . . . . . and let me be specific here  the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production  it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement . i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission  demanding that he run home and swallow two  gallons of drain  o or i will do it for him .  br    br   if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad  just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again . trust me  i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the   nd time of sitting through this .  br    br   stop these movies  they are just the most vile of all facets of our society . please . stop . now .  
1,as i watched one of orson welles  last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker  i knew i was watching a great movie unfold  though at times i did not know why . the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film  noir average  joe lead  femme fatale  conspicuous supporting characters  and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure . it is an entertaining ride  and it  s filled to the brim with welles  unique gifts as a director  but there are scenes that tend to just not work  or don  t feel complete in what was welles  full vision  the latter is unfortunately too true  executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that  .  br    br   welles co  stars with his then wife  the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth  as mike o  hara  an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people . hayworth is mrs . bannister  married to mr . bannister  everett sloane  who played mr . bernstein in citizen kane   who is accompanied by a friend mr . grisby  glenn anders  who has great control in his eyes  . they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o  hara along for the ride  and at first he  s reluctant  but agrees since he  s falling for the married mrs . as their journey unfolds  o  hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around  and more so with grisby  who at first seems out of his gourd . yet as the plot unfolds  o  hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money  with results that i dare not reveal  although they have been discussed over and over by others  .  br    br   whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story  and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated   the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty  five years . though he doesn  t have the terrific greg tolland  kane  s dp  at his side  dependable charles lawton jr . assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark  covered in shadows  deep focus  low angles  the works . a particular accomplishment is the fun  house mirror scene  which is merely a highlight among others . welles himself is always dependable as an actor  even if his accent isn  t anything special  and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush  despite her path in the story .  br    br   the lady from shanghai is worth checking out  especially for welles  hayworth  or film  noir buffs  fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well  . it may just take a little while  repeat viewings  as was for touch of evil   for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in .  
0,i used to review videos for joe bob briggs  legendary  we are the weird  newsletter . i saw a lot of stinkers  but this by far was the worst  and the years have not been kind  it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed . don  t get me wrong  caged terror is nominally more technically competent than  say  monster  a  go  go or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk . what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension . is it a vietnam commentary  an ecological protest  an incitement to race riot  a study of man  s inhumanity to man  a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to  nearly  feature length  in short a hep young urban professional  possibly the most loathesome screen character ever  somehow seduces a nubile asian  american associate into camping in the woods with him . after brow  beating her with quasi  philosophical clap for the better part of an hour  they run across two wandering veterans  the unforgettable jarvis  a righteous brother  and the troubadour  guitar  toting manson family reject  . hey  a plot twist  tension  action  suspense  well  no  just a climactic getting  locked  in  a  makeshift  wire  chicken  coop  and  lightly  belittled scene . the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters   no . . . no . . . please . . . don  t . . .  meanwhile  jarvis addresses the troubadour as  trouby  once every two minutes  bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquer  s pod people . that  s about all that happens in caged terror  and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable . but trust me  i  ve seen thousands of movies in my life  and this one has remained  for the past eight years since i first saw it  the absolute worst .  i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself  and reassure myself i certainly do .  i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this very little happens  and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly  what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really  really want to shove some kind of message down your throat . but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual  what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort . this film is   minutes long and feels like three and a half hours . it  s terrible  truly truly terrible . folks  trust me  i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse . go see it  you  ll thank me . and curse me . just for the record  my favorite line  in caged terror but perhaps ever   yeah  well  you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christ  s love for the church . . .    note must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension .   
0,michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was  the only film  he  did purely for the money  as well as  the worst film he ever starred in  . hold on  michael  weren  t you in the swarm and hurry sundown  and weren  t both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti  perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing    degrees fahrenheit temperatures  the director  richard fleischer  was hospitalised as a result of sun  stroke during the shoot  . what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low  point of michael caine . instead  it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast  exotic locations  boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline .  br    br   dr . david linderby  caine  is a w . h . o medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa  beverly johnson  goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village . linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders  led by suleiman  peter ustinov   and he sets off on a continent  wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east .  br    br   along the way  big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles . william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest . the film is based on a best  seller entitled ebano  by the little  known author alberto vasquez  figueroa  but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation . ustinov is charismatic as the slaver  he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances   and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he  ll never see his wife again . there are occasional flashes of action  but on the whole ashanti is quite slow  moving . all in all  it is a resistible piece of action hokum  not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested  but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let  down from all the talent involved .  
0,i  m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn  t . you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy  slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department .  br    br   i just sat there through most of the movie thinking  is this supposed to be funny  and  this is the guy from tenacious d right   . the truth is this film has nothing to offer . at all  it  s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction . you  ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn  t . i was bored stupid about   minutes in but though it would surely pick up . it didn  t .   minutes later i  d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful .  br    br   it  s like  remember years ago when you  d see anything with your fave actor in it  even some of their really early pap from before they were famous  and you  d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop . yeah it  s like that .  br    br   i  ve enjoyed some of jack black  s earlier movies like shallow hall and i  m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man . if you do this to us again jack i  m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something . at the least give you a serious talking to .  br    br   i know it  s a clich but this is one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen and for so many reasons . . . .  
1,people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs  congo  king kong vs . godzilla  king kong        they all ripoff one another  but yeti stands on its own . it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal  s attraction with one female .  br    br   the yeti myth is based on bigfoot  not like king kong  and archeologists have been fascinated it  at one time they did exist  but there is no scientific data to prove it .  br    br   this movie is hard to find  but its worth watching it . the first time i watched it was on  elvira  s mistress of the dark shows  in the early      s . it sent chills down my spine as a kid  especially when the yeti got mad . i saw it again  around     am on abc about  to  yrs ago . seeing it again made me appreciate it more  it has some overall good effects  for its time  and the story involves a mute boy and his dog  and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes . also the music is pretty cool  its very yeti like .     br    br   gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere .  br    br   vote  and half out of   .  
1,this is one of the best films ever made . it is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of american history . the setting is     wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century . the film keeps your interest without the added hollywood myths . the whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in america when it was mostly a rural nation . with this film  you will escape the present and witness the daily life of    years ago . in a beautiful  scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive  as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure . see this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation  s history . this film is worth your time to see . my only question is  why aren  t there more films like this one   
0,i watched this today  partially attracted to the all  star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk . however  this is one to avoid . there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow  the billiards challenge at the start  for example . the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies  you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh . is that instantaneous death  there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot  like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers . the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch . if you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about  kph are the highlight . somehow one manages to creep up on david mccullum and give him a nip . its as if there was no time to get out of the way  like when the obelisk in the city falls over  the native has all the time in the world to take a  step to the left  but no he screams and it falls on him . i only give this a  because of ekland . and why does mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses   
1,i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show . i still vividly remember the film  especially the performance of robert taylor . i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid  almost dull leading man type  and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks . this film  however  proved what an interesting actor he could be . he did not get enough roles like this during his long career . this is his best performance . he is totally believable in a truly villainous role . from what i have read  he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles . he basically would just do what mgm gave him . this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles . the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan  s character was . nolan was a great actor  but this character really aggravated me . the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years . this film is definitely worth a look .  
0,just like last years event wwe new years revolution     was headlined by an elimination chamber match . the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value . in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany  new york with the wwe championship . those men were current champion john cena  kurt angle and shawn michaels . there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies carlito or chris masters . and kane  kane last held the wwe championship in june      and that was only for one night . it was obvious he wasn  t going to be the one either . last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer .     was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far .  br    br   the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event . out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber . it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there . with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe . this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night .  br    br   the undercard  like last year  was truly atrocious . triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away . hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it  any pay  per  view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it . the king pinned helms  who books this stuff   and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama .  br    br   the women of the wwe also had a busy night . there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman  s championship was also on the line . in a match  i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania   mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match . trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future .  br    br   the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion  ric flair . this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish . edge obviously had bigger fish to fry .  br    br   so new years revolution kicked off the     pay  per  view calendar in disastrous fashion . the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up . they don  t get much worse than this .  
1,i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i haven  t had so much fun at a movie in a long time . wes craven is at his best ever . he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving . this is the thriller of the year . . no doubt .  br    br   all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun . the f  x were great . it steadily built suspense . i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie . it  s been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater .  br    br   if your looking for thrills  action and a good plot this summer  redeye delivers . go see it   
0,if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease  inducing dogme   style  i would never have rented it . nevertheless  i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot . i lasted a very  very  very long forty minutes before giving up . it  s just boring  pretentious twaddle .  br    br   the last french movie i saw was  romance  and it too was pretty dismal  but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time . i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme   overseas   it  ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy .  it  s called dogme   because that  s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera .   br    br    
1,this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph w . sarno . it features plenty of soft core sex  really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women . the acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well  made . marie forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror movie  it  s a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body . sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies . a must see for fans of sexploitation   
1,this complicated story begins fairly simply  with an english journalist accepting a wager from edgar allen poe and his friend lord blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted blackwood castle . once there  the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors  until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room . he sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard  and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth blackwood . she informs him with an ambiguous charming  eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night . . . the night of the dead . thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night . spoiler ahead it probably won  t surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely elizabeth is actually a ghost . this doesn  t prevent her from falling in love with the journalist  but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple . this is a fun movie  with absolutely everything ghosts  the spooky castle  repeated visions of past events  sex and violence  though both have been toned down in the version most americans have seen over the years .  the alluring  captivating barbara steele is the main reason to see it . she has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you  ve ever seen in the movies . recommended   
1,king of masks  bian lian in china  is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film . winner of   awards from around the world  this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian  a street performer in     s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face  change opera . he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance  and no one knows how he does it . he has a longing desire to have a grandson  as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir . we then go to the streets  and see that people are selling their children because they can  t afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free  because daughters are not worth much in this society . wang bianlian  s story goes on from there .  br    br   the film was so astonishingly good  the acting was amazing  and the issues were so weighty and well  addressed . there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place  no one wants a little girl . also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman  and while he is famous and well  respected  he regards himself as something low  a half woman . as we go further into the film  the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it  the brutality and corruption of the military and police  and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions .  br    br   this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life  and xu zhu  the actor who plays wang bianlian  presents yet another beautiful performance .  
1,when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny . basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go . but its not all that easy . in this movie you will come across hilarious humor  a witch  a book of spells  recopies  a mentally challenged uncle and a dog . you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie . hope you like it in total i will have to give it a  . . . . no i  m totally joking ill give it a  hope you understand that you will laugh  you will scream and you may just be offended .  br    br   love yours truly dakota you can email me at dakota  loves  ithot mail . com if you wanna  
0,based on the personal experiences of director john singleton  s time at the university of southern california  comes higher learning . a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges .  br    br   there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story malik williams  an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male . kristin conner  a sheltered soft white girl  and remy  a unsophisticated unconnected white male . all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared  malik   by being naive  kristin   and by being unwanted  remy  .  br    br   one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large . the colleges are not places to build character  develop potential  or enhance personal advancement  but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one  size  fits  all atmosphere . it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students . it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics .  br    br   but it didn  t and that  s where the films falls apart . singleton  it seems  had a pretty bad experience at southern california . through this film he lets it all hang out . there is no need to beat around the bush here . singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen .  br    br   the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains  save for kristin  who was raped by a fellow white student .  br    br   who can understand the inconsistencies of this film  black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her  the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence   br    br   the performances of omar epps  malik  and kristy swanson  kristin  are disappointing . they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie  tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable  . o  shea jackson aka ice cube  busta rhymes  and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles . and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor . only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character  of the three main characters  changed the most in the film .  br    br   john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film . and he did so quite badly . it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun . life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this . higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all . seeing the film  then and now  would only confuse  disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to . not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest .  
1,i have a feeling that the warners bros depression  era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years . yes  we are in the economic doldrums  or have you been living under a rock  and times look bleak . but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles . in the    s  film  going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom .  footlight parade        was one such film that audiences flocked to . while this lloyd bacon  directed musical doesn  t quite capture the social issues of the time as  gold diggers of            does  it  s still a wonderful showcase of talent . we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers  but boy  are they worth waiting for me . yes  little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress  and her tapping is so  so  but busby  s magical  by a waterfall  whisks her  and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls  into a dizzying water wonderland . of course busby  s numbers could never really be performed on a stage  they defy limits of gravity  for one thing   and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough  wisecracking non  musical scenes . and  footlight  also has james cagney in at the one of his all  too  few musicals  really  what couldn  t this man do   . he even gets to take over from the leading man  don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil  who is really little ruby in china  girl wig   . he co  stars with joan blondell  his adorable  adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women  until the final reel  that is  . apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife . and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene .  
0,there was nothing of value in the original movie  this one was even lamer . the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing . anyone connected to this film has to be high on something  so what was the story line  what was with the girl  was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film . sadly  i tried several times to watch this . i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback . kid said it was stupid  and he was four years old . i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director  as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film . that might be pushing it . i did love the theme song . good thing it was only a dollar  it was worth it . i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be . is pot legal in france   
1,the surprise nominee of this year  s best animated feature race at the oscars . it  s an irish film by heart  but it was co  produced by belgium and brazil  with  i  m guessing  animators working in all three countries . the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory . the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back  with very simple characters with thick  black outlines . this film is not in black and white . oh no . what makes this film great is its use of color  simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i  ve ever seen . the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical  with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals . much of the film can be spent playing find the circle  a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image . all of these geometrical designs have a purpose  the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts  the book of kells is a real illuminated bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it  . the story of the film isn  t especially deep  but it  s a pretty good fantasy tale . brendan is a young boy in kells  a city surrounded by enormous walls  built by his uncle to keep out vikings . a newcomer to kells  brother aiden  inspires brendan to take up illustrating . he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest  within which lives a nymph . bruno coulais provides a fantastic score  almost as good as the one he did for coraline  which i consider the very best of the year .  
0,this is not a children  s movie     br    br   this movie is like a  bad acid trip  for kids under the age of  . for a month my  year old from time  to  time would ask me  why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth  or  why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits   .  and that wasn  t the worst of it  . we stopped it about a    hour in but the damage had been done . intensely morbid  oppressive  violent . fortunately he  s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing . whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges . . . .  go ahead censure me  my conscience is clear .  .  
1,i have to be honest  i was expecting a failure so bad  because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money . but that wasn  t the case with this pretty funny  sometimes odd  movie . i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba  the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny . the jacuzzi bubble  and when pumba leaves  the bubbles stop . it  s all harmless fun  good for kids and some adults . i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie . while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end  it works .  out of    
1,to finally see what many consider to be the greatest women  in  prison film of all time  i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds . boy  it sure contained the elements i expected  and delivered so much more . a constant i  m discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold  tolerance  and resolve  . . not to mention sanity  being tested by their superiors . while most of them were hired for the way they look naked  because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements  something else emerges  other attributes  such as attitude and guts  that i ultimately respond to .  br    br   this  as you may know all too well  was demme  s debut for his mentor roger corman  and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings . for instance  there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states  . . there  s a particular number featuring warden barbara steele where she reminded me of alex de large of a clockwork orange  .  br    br   the film has female prisoners planning a daring escape  tired of the crazed antics of their wheel  chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc  randolph  warren miller  . juanita brown is maggie  the tough  sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out . she  s the one all the girls fear to cross . erica gavin is jacqueline wilson  the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop  unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with . roberta collins is belle  a serial kleptomaniac  best pals with pandora  ella reid  . belle becomes the obsession of randolph who promises superintendent mcqueen  steele  that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies . drugging her up  randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her  whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms . cheryl rainbeaux smith is lavelle  in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a senator . lavelle receives work in randolph  s office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to pandora . demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break  out  using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages  with gunfire erupting .  br    br   i was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time demme collaborator  cinematographer tak fujimoto  as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison  cells and rooms  not an easy task . the prison is appropriately crummy and the girls  despite being quite attractive  look the part of desperate inmates longing  yearning from the very pits of their souls  to escape such horrid entrapment . steele is superb as the warden  understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far  candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint . . notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge . cale  s bluesy score is incredibly depressing  while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun  and  games . . i think cale  s score mirrors demme  s handling of the material . cale and demme  s partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad  isolating  oppressive place  while  almost simultaneously  showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast . my favorite scene happens outside the prison  as two of our girls  . . joining forces with a third  interrupt a bank robbery already in progress . . the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob  as you might expect  you get naked women in showers  prisoner in solitary  a cat fight  shootouts  attempted escapes which go awry  and other exploitative elements  . . such as a horrifying shock therapy session  not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of belle  . interesting enough  demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension  understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making .  
1,  shall we dance    a light  hearted flick from japan  tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he see  s from the train during his daily commute . what he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and  most of all  himself . funny  poignant  and utterly charming   swd  is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers .  b   
0,wow  what a great cast  julia roberts  john cusack  christopher walken  catherine zeta  jones  hank azaria . . . what  s that  a script  you say  now you  re just being greedy  surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary  you  d think so  but no . america  s sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another . it  s like everyone involved woke up before each day  s writing  shooting  editing and though  you know what  i  ve been working pretty hard lately  and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names  right  i  m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can .  so much potential  yet so painful to sit through . there isn  t a single aspect of this thing that doesn  t suck . even julia  s fat suit is lame .  
1,normally  i don  t watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar . this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes  but the characters and the originality of the film  s premise made it much easier to watch . david duchovny bended his normal acting approach  which was great to see . angelina jolie  of course  was beautiful and did great acting . great cast all together . a must see for people bored with the same old action movie .  
0,words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . it is a series of random  unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady  really disturbing  . the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco  the best actor in this movie . also  it is rated nc     shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .  
1,i  ve really enjoyed this adaptation of  emma  . i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again . though it only lasts    minutes  most of the novel plot and sub  plots were developed in a satisfactory way . all the characters are well  portrayed . most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompson  s sense and sensibility .  br    br   as a foreigner  i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors . the setting and costumes were beautiful . i find this version quite on a par with the     miniseries  pride and prejudice  but then the producer and screenwriter were the same . kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying  emma  of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no  one but her would love . she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable . mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley  not an easy part  i think  though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth  s mr darcy in pride and prejudice . even the end scene  the harvest festival  which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him  even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity  had she been in his situation . a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film . i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen  s novels .  
1,mad dog  earle is back  along with his sad  sack moll marie  and that fickle clubfoot velma . so are babe and red  doc and big mac  and even the scenery  chewing mutt pard . the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh  s high sierra   years later without rethinking a line or a frame  and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original .  instead of walsh we get stuart heisler  for humphrey bogart we get jack palance  for ida lupino shelley winters  and so on down through the credits .  the only change is that  this time  instead of black  and  white  it  s in warnercolor sadly  there are those who would count this an improvement .  br    br   i died a thousand times may be unnecessary  and inferior  but at least it  s not a travesty the story still works on its own stagy terms . earle  palance   fresh out of the pen near chicago  drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney  jr .  knocking over a post mountain resort . en route  he almost collides with a family of oakies  when he  s smitten with their granddaughter the smiting holds even when he discovers she  s lame . arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up  he finds amateurish hotheads at one another  s throats as well as winters  who throws herself at him  as does the pooch  . biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel  palance  to winter  s chagrin  offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl  s deformity  a gesture that backfires . then  the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath . on the lam  palance moves higher into the cold sierras . . . .  br    br   it  s an absorbing enough story  competently executed  that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in      the year bogie  with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon  became a star . and one last  heretical note those mountains do look gorgeous in color .  br    br    
0,when anyone comes into a film of this type of film it  s not without saying that an overdose of that great over  the  counter brain  medicine  suspension of disbelief  comes in mighty handy .  br    br   jeanette macdonald plays two roles anna  brigitta  the woman who nelson eddy has ignored since the beginning of time  but who also is   an angel sent to earth .  br    br   my reaction when i saw this was a mute gasp of  hunh   where have i seen this before  it turns out  i have seen it before  but in a movie made much later than this one . date with an angel  a forgettable pile of dreck made in      cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one emmanuelle beart who had no speaking lines  also wore a blond wig  and made life hell for soap  actor michael knight . much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra  low   s values but more than likely an updated version of this     turkey .  br    br   anyway  not to elaborate  this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time macdonald and eddy  neither very good actors but terrific singers  would be together playing up the  innocence  and  clean  cut  romance that they were known for . after that you may need a cold shower  not because there are any steamy scenes here  but to get rid of the memory .  
0,probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this  br    br    . they might not have read the book .  . they might enjoy gore and violence in a film .  . they might be very young and therefore not understand the violence .  . people might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book .  . there are sure to be many other reasons not covered here .  br    br   the only thing i liked about this film is the song   bright eyes  .  br    br   if perchance  you happen to be one of those people who has read the book  enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence  you are sure not to like this . otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this .  br    br   like in the book  a rabbit called fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . only a few rabbits  including his brother hazel  believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live . . .  
1,i caught this movie on my local movie channel  and i rather enjoyed watching the film . it has all the elements of a good teen film  and more  this film  aside from dealing with boys  girls relationships and sex and the like  also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people .  br    br   the film has that real  life feel to it  no loud music  no special effects and no outrageous scenes  which  for this movie  was right . that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film  some of which we probably know from where we live .  br    br   overall  a good movie  fun to watch .  br    br        
1,this is the best movie i  ve come across in a long while . not only is this the best movie of its kind  school shooting  the way ben coccio  the director  decided to film it was magnificent . he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school . he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film . also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary . it is almost artful .  if that is indeed a word  there are a few slip ups however  for example when cal calls brads    land rover a range rover  or vice versa  it  s been awhile since i  ve seen it   
1,ernst lubitsch  s contribution to the american cinema is enormous . his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever  as is the case with  the shop around the corner  . this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play  without the charm or elegance of mr . lubitsch  s own  and definite version .  br    br   margaret sullavan and james stewart worked in several films together . their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all . both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don  t know of one another  but who fate had them working together in the same shop in budapest .  br    br   the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture . in here  we have the wonderful frank morgan  playing the owner of the shop . also  we see joseph schildkraut  felix bressart  william tracy and charles smith  among others  doing impressive work in making us believe that yes  they are in budapest .  br    br   that is why these films will live forever   
1,the makers have chosen the best people for the job  and set the scene wonderfully . every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it . whether the period is the   s  the first story   the present  ie      for the middle story  or the     s  the last   costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created . i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium  exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls . roland culver as ashenden is very appealing  but never mind the soppy young lovers  it  s raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife  s health and independence who harrows our emotions . he usually played comical  pompous types  but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive . the china seas  great   s film starring gable and harlow  stole the plot from the mr know all episode  and also nicked a story by kipling  . i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband  though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat . i love that posh bird who plays his wife  too .  
0,this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen  the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame   
0,this is easily the worst ridley scott film . ridley scott is a wonderful director . but this film is a black mark on his career . demi moore and viggo mortensen  both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army . very stupid . and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way . it is really not difficult to make a film such as this . everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody . the writers didn  t have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action . i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish . i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention  and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess .  
0,this movie is so bad it hurts . the car doing   mph when it  s supposed to go    . . . the shift lever that  s stuck  in park    the nurse that drives for almost  hours with the cell phone on the shoulder . . . can  t any of the  morons take this damn phone  there  s nothing credible in this crap . i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this   
0,tom is listening to one of those old  time radio broadcasts  something kids from the     s to today would watch on tv . however  they didn  t television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment  from comedies to music to scary stories  from the radio .  br    br   tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the  phantom .  he  s actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying  such as  hair standing on end  icy chills race down her spine  her heart beats in her throat   etc . jerry  meanwhile  is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy  cat antics .  br    br   we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this     cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure . if the cat asks for trouble  that  s one thing  but when he  s minding own business and jerry is physically  and in this case  mentally  abusing him  i have a hard time rooting for the  little guy .   br    br   these early tm efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed . sometimes that one minute makes a difference . it did here as this actually dragged for awhile . it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long . that  s usual for tom and jerry  s . usually  they are much faster  paced .  
0,this movie had potential  but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse  s acting . i  ve never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else  but her performance in this movie is bad .  br    br   her delivery is robotic . when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head . so  her voice has very little inflection . i can  t believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie . she has to know somebody in the biz .  br    br   now i hate to be this mean about her  but the comment has to be  this  long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else .  br    br   however  i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it . the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie . but the end was disappointing as well . maybe if her acting had been better  i would have liked it .  
1,really . . . and incredible film that though isn  t very popular . . . extremely touching and almost life altering . . . was for me at least .  br    br   definitely worth seeing and buying . . . . . added to my favorite movie list . . . . it  s number one now . . . .  br    br   this is a very touching movie that all people should see . .  br    br   the man in the moon . . . . . we  ll it  s just incredible . it  s now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i  d recommend it to anyone above   as long as you  re somewhat mature . . . . . . if you don  t really try to feel the characters emotions then you  ll never get the true meaning and value of this movie . . . . but it really is incredible . . . . just watch it because it  ll alter the way some people look at life . . . . worth seeing     
1,this movie is actually funny  if you  d like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it . it  s called blonde and blonder  so don  t expect profound and meaningful jokes . what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes . it  s just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends  especially if you  re not too sober . lol  pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks . it  s a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art . c  mon  this movie is about blondes  it  s supposed to be light  funny and superficial . one more thing  i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will .  
0,tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about druids . what they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers .  br    br   if i had to sum up evil breed  it would be a low grade gore fest . the film mixes dead alive  evil dead  wrong turn all in one . it  s just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any  fun  one would have watching it . the film has lots of random  horror  nudity . . . although the film also stars four porn stars  yup four  so there could have been plenty more . breed also showcases a good amount of gore .  br    br   evil breed has a horrible start  with laughable dialogue and horrible acting . that  s a given in a straight to video horror film  but this takes the cake . i can  t really figure out who the main character is  since the one female who  lives  at the end is not really in the movie all that much . speaking of the ending  that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film . it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one  s view of the film .  br    br   you have to see this film to believe it  since there are some pretty great death scenes . there are two death scenes that come into my mind  one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest . . . . yea her chest  don  t ask me . the other id when the guy gets his intestines  yet again  ripped out through his asshole . does that kill the guy  no  the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines . these scenes remind me so much of dead  alive  with the right amount of humour in each . i also got the sense of evil dead  with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam raimi . along with halloween  when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperatelyy to get in .  br    br   although  the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film . when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs  her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots . distracting indeed . as well as the continuity in the film  with only one inbred killer  as well as which character dies at which moment . i couldn  t tell if the breast implant chick was jenny or gary  s sister  cousin . . . i can  t remember . as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body  still attached with the umbilical cord .  br    br   the horrible editing is distracting as well  the opening credits are too fast and disorienting . it did have a bad start and got better  but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level . if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film  then it wouldn  t have been horribly butchered to death . stay away from this film  unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore .  
1,well  this film is a difficult one really . to be straight with you  this film doesn  t contain much of a riveting story  nore does it make u  want  to know how it  ll end . . . but i  ll tell you something now . . . never have i been as tense and jumped up before in my life  this film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills  to be fair  i did watch it at almost midnight so i was kinda sleepy anyway  so maybe that explains why i was jumpy . . . or maybe it  s because this film does deliver in that aspect  it  s basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event . they decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains . . . all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors  i think it  s it  s the sister of the main character  and she brings along her husband  . . . during the night  the husband hears noises . . . checks it out  and thats when things start to go really really wrong . . . they don  t stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn  t right . . . to cut a long story short . . . eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of .  br    br   it  s not a hollywood blockbuster  nore does it have a huge budget  but please don  t let that put you off . it  s creepy  tense and very very jumpy  just give it a try    
1,finally  after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of  basic instinct   we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this  i remember everything about the original  the steam  the romance  the sex  the interrogation  the music  by the master jerry goldsmith   and everything else from violence and murder  to intense confrontations of all kind  make no mistake   basic instinct  was a real winner for audiences everywhere . i can remember in     when we were first given the news about such a sequel . five years later  we have it . i never would have thought it to end up such as this . when it was declared a dropped project  time sure couldn  t tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with . well  i guess we now know anything  s possible in this case . even if the original director  or writer are not present  all we need is the glamorous  always reliable sharon stone  and we have a done deal  please  hear me out . . .  br    br   when people say that this film is bad  i think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme  and slightly dated . i use the word  dated  only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years  and audiences have become adapted to the pointless  boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money  and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly . who needs hole some and clean  of course it  s a pleasant thing to have  but c  mon  escapism is really seldom these days  and  basic instinct   gives us real fans what we  ve been expecting . this film is not an academy award winner  nor does it try to be . it simply delivers the die  hard fans what they have been expecting . it  s a film for fun . movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously  but this film is just loose and fun  not taking itself seriously  not too seriously anyway . that said  i shall evaluate the film .  br    br   the film is a fast  paced film from the first second  as we see cathernine tremell in a car  speeding at    mph  and enjoying lustful thrills doing so . perhaps sex and driving does not mix  because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and . . . well  she gets away unharmed  but her studly partner doesn  t fare too well . once again  tremell is the primary suspect of the accident  and will be put under analyst  s and psychiatrists . dr . michael glass  morrissey  is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her . like another criminal investigator before him  he is entranced and seduced  slowly  and surely . his denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do . tramell is possibly more dangerous now  than she was before  but like the first one  we  ll never really know  will we  once the seduction is in motion  jealousy  rage  drugs  and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues   br    br   this film does not recycle the first one  but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time . this is a good thing . it lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two . sharon stone dazzles us again  as though   years has not come to pass . her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier . just awesome  david morrissey is well cast  and manages pretty well . the fact that a non  popular star was chosen  makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him  just what we see him perform . my final thought   .  to  out of   . so it  s not the first one  nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place . it can  however  live up to the standards set by the first film  and it does folks  it does .  
1,as a former  time okinawan karate world champion  i like movies about sacrifice for sport . but this movie is about so much more . this movie is so good and so deep . i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion . almost lights out for me . and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about . this is a movie about living . living your life for yourself and respect for others . empowerment . god  bless  bend it like beckham  i believe it is a true gem .  
0,there are no reasons to watch this movie . should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life  s every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill  like that would ever happen  then get this movie from the video shop  if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie . be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone  in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing  . oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk  go figure . but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie  claudia udy showing her chest  sadly no other reason than that   
1,not to be confused with the resse witherspoon high school film of the same name  this is a stylised look at hong kong  s triad gangs . called election because a new leader or  chairman  is elected by ancient traditions every two years . two candidates are up for the position and through ego  bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least . expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory . the asian godfather this is not  but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence . subtitled volume  i think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals . either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right .  
1,this film has renewed my interest in french cinema . the story is enchanting  the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful . i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie .  
0,back in the day  i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show . . . and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me  i was not estatic  but curious . . . i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck . my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy  i  m actually gay   so i decided to watch the show with low expectations .  br    br   what a horrible experience            first off  i hate the new characters . tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff  it  s sad . i also hate how they made chef kalasaki  or whatever his nonstraight name was  a good guy who owned a restaurant . bad move   kids tv  escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede  who sucks big time in this show  and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby . so stupid  i hate this show .  br    br   i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity . kirby  ll never beat mario in the fight for coolness  and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness . nuf said     
1,a message movie  but a rather good one . outstanding cast  top to bottom . interesting in that bette davis  s plot line is essentially back story  the extremely negative reviews  name throwing at the screenplay  playwright  associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about  angles in america   etc . etc .  object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii . gosh  that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me .  br    br   theatrical and movie  making  and acting styles vary over time and of course   years later this particular movie would not be made in this way . yes casablanca is a better movie  i guess   but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them  casablanca is primarily a love story . the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot   more of a thriller . both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors . the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited  
1,i saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on dvd . recently  i watched several of the reality series on pbs about ranching  etc . none of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does . based on real reality  pulling no punches  bleak  happy  tragic and enlightening  this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life . fine acting on the part of both rip torn and conchata ferrell add to an well done script . the opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the national endowment for the humanities . if this is the kind of product taxes could go to i would be happy to see more . i highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film .  
0,hello boys and girls . . . this isn  t your regular movie review  because this is going to be the cold . hard . truth . are you serious  this movie sucked so many balls i couldn  t keep them out of my mouth  they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen . you  d need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie .  br    br   the plot was very lacking . the actors were terrible . i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit . do boys  everyone   br    br   peace rh besties  lyf  
0,after waking up at     in the morning and not being able to go to sleep  i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation . this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it . what a mistake   br    br   here is the plot  potential spoilers  if you even care   a neurotic man with an addiction to candy  josh kornbluth  works as a temp for some ridiculous company . suddenly  he is offered the chance to  go perm   which seems to be the favorite catch  phrase of this movie . but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp  josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn  t want to do it . he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . his inability to send several  very important  letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious  but is merely stupid . josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together  obviously a fantasy of josh  s in real life  as such a thing would never happen  . a bunch of other stuff happens  but it  s too trite and inane to go into now .  br    br   despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy  i only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth  my initial reaction was one of stifling fear  and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman  yeah  right  . josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying  looking person i have ever seen in my life . he is an unattractive  overweight  balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . i do not at all sympathize with josh  s character . he is lazy and unmotivated and i just don  t appreciate the failed attempts at humor . skip it  even if your life depends upon it .  
1,like his elder brothers  claude sautet and jean  pierre melville  alain corneau began to cut his teeth in french cinema with a series of fine thrillers  la menace        and  srie noire        among others .  police python     is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career . they had a splendid cinematography  painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency  s sake .  br    br   the police superintendent ferrot  yves montand  is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone . he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia lopardi  stefania sandrelli  and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover his superior ganay  franois prier  . when the latter learns it  he kills her in a fit of anger . ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him . . .  br    br   one could deem that this kind of far  fetched story isn  t exempt from glitches and sometimes  one can see right through it but corneau  s pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling  dusky atmosphere . the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however  it is crucial for what will follow this key  moment . corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary  minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation . in spite of drawbacks  corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story . mnard  mathieu carrire  who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation . but his superior knows that he usually works alone . actually  ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself . eventually  the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself . he  s a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization . it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won  t recognize him when he is brought face to face with them .  br    br   the backdrop of this thriller  orlans is efficiently enhanced by corneau  s camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm .  
1,ah  clichs  clichs  clichs they  re a main part of a wide variety of horror films . this one  has a lot of them . still  it  s stephen king  one of the best masters of horror . this movie was really good  just too predictable . and what horror movie doesn  t have stupid people  this one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken . pet semetary i found to be creepy a little . the way everything is set up was really spooky  but not terrifying . for the most part  the acting was somewhat believable  the suspense wasn  t that suspenseful  but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen . all stephen king fans must see this movie  but as for anyone else  expect an okay thriller .  
1,this movie is incredible . with great characters  specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees  this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil . the final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool .  br    br   very  very recommendable . not for the smallest children though . this one deserves a   .  
1,a tour deforce  ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet  starting with the great cinematography  color  costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie . i have seen several adaptations of this great novel  but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot  it is a masterful fagan  never leaving his character to do a song . you never really know if you like him or not  the same feeling i got in the book . in other versions you hate him from start to finish . bill sykes . . . . when you read the book hes a mean one  and so he is in this movie . oliver reed was masterful . his wife directed this masterpiece . i went and saw his last movie  gladiator based on his many fine performances  not to see the headliners . the music fits the times and the mood . who will buy this beautiful movie  you should   
0,for   years after world war  the united states was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests . at the same time  because of the draft and wars  everyone in society had served  or was connected to someone who had .  br    br   this allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of american cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine . sometimes that machine was non  us military  for example in prisoner of war situations . once removed are stories in other machines science fiction and corporate  but they always reference this military genre  and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling .  br    br   you can trace it  i think  perhaps starting in the comic  meaning amrican  sections of  the great escape   which immediately spawned teevee offspring in  gomer pyle  and  hogan  s heros .  then a second wave triggered by  catch    and  mash   both of which had been real life  then books  then movies  and in the mash case  then teevee .  br    br   but before all that  there was the  phil silvers show   about a sergeant bilko and this followed from  mister roberts .  a happy con man  who only committed harmless crimes  and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life . this was in the day when teevee shows mattered . you absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about . it wasn  t particularly clever in any way  except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom .  br    br   its one large zone where americans worked out how they think about forgivable  even endearing lies in a military context  a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here .  br    br   because its big  it sometimes pays off in laughs .  stripes  was pretty darn funny i thought . it had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes  sort of folding in some  dirty dozen .  and sexual adventure .  br    br   now this  well before the cultural wars escalated . it tries to touch that sweet spot  like other remakes that manhandled steve martin . it is so unfunny  you actually root for the army to be the stronger player . yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power .  br    br   ted  s evaluation    of   you can find something better to do with this part of your life .  
0,george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress . she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune . he interviews her on her yacht . they fall for each other in bathing costumes .  br    br   it turns out  quite early  that she is not an heiress . she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream .  br    br   the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance .  br    br   the supporting cast does little to buoy it up . davis and brent carry the picture . though it  s fairly predictable  it is also fairly entertaining . it  s far from her best . but  especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre  it  s not one of her worst  either .  
1,there  s a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist  actually exist right now . it  s a bit too much to wrap your head around  but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place . for barbara jean trenton  ida lupino   that time was twenty five years earlier  the mid      s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise . for my part  if i could travel through time  it would be back to the      s when i grew up . maybe to a place like willoughby  but that  s another episode .  br    br   one thing that wouldn  t be so special about     would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of  the twilight zone  . how many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series  and then find a particular story you wanted to watch  i guess you have to consider the trade offs  convenience versus simplicity  having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins . popping in a cd has it  s advantages .  br    br   i  m a little surprised that rod serling would pen a story that so closely resembled  sunset boulevard  . ida lupino  s character mirror imaged norma desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept . martin balsam portrays very much a similar character to erich von stroheim  the husband turned butler who  s loyalty is unquestioned . where the story diverges has to do with the way danny  balsam  and sall  ted de corsia  challenge barbara jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence .  br    br   fortunately for us viewers  ida lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were  not big  but a nice showcase  . it  s a real treat to watch any episode of  the twilight zone  and get to see who pops up from days gone by . sometimes you get a two  fer  like you have here with lupino and balsam  celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began  and sometimes after . combined with the stories that the program produced  it  s not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today .  
1,i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out  and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun . this is a great cast of characters  many big names in it  a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now . i think it  s a great idea if you follow any of these actors  or have loved them in other movies  to add it to your watched list . some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well  done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue  kind of odd spontaneous  appearing comedy  with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors . the movie did a great job at giving you some insight  perhaps even very realistic  into the culture of a daytime soap .  
1,this show is good . i like the acting  funny bits and the cuteness of it . the actors  lee pace  ann friel . . . etc  they all did great in the show . the show started off great with its funny  illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly  as what people said  the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway . and now i really hate the fact that it  s going to be cancelled . why doesn  t abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done   i really wanna know how the story  s going to be . i think it should be given a chance as there  re still so many viewers who love it .  
1,anyone interested in pop music  and not familiar with british music trends of the late  seventies  should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once . the movie  about a young woman  s quest to make her mark in the music world  captures the times perfectly  from the overt sexism  rough economic times  social upheaval  to the shift in pop culture from rough  and  tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism  new romanticism . the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late  seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled  there really has been nothing new since      . this was a dazzling time  and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape  and does both extremely well .  
1,i have to say  from the beginning  when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn  t blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie  with a lot of potential  though the movie wasn  t as  erm  amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens  which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing  even though i  m not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people  i don  t remember one line from either of those movies  i  m not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts  in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you  ah getting slightly off the point here  well my point is that the that you don  t have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series  which unfortunately ended after   amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end  in     .  br    br   though i didn  t like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in      and let me tell you  the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series  the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects  were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today . i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn  t for stargate  and my dad  who actually got me into sci fi when i was like   and i  m glad he did  other wise i wouldn  t have seen the brilliant shows like sg   which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies  basically if a new sci fi series isn  t better or as good as sg   its not worth watching . basically this is the best sci fi show to date  and if you don  t watch this  then you have no idea what you are missing   
1,it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film  whereas patton  lust for glory   producer frank mccarthy  s earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war  has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments . like a previous reviewer  i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other .  br    br   one difference between the two films is that patton  is more focused  concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war  whereas macarthur  covers not only this war but also its subject  s role in the korean war  as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude .  br    br   the main difference  however  lies in the way the two leaders are played . gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c . scott dominated patton  . whereas scott had another major star  karl malden  playing opposite him as general bradley  none of the other actors in macarthur  are household names  at least for their film work . scott  of course  portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery  tempered  a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race  not just with the enemy . i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton  but that is not how he appears in this film . peck  s macarthur is of a more reflective  thoughtful bent  comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films . at times  he even seems to be a man of the political left . much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in     could have been written by a paid  up member of cnd  and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi  socialist air to them . in an attempt to show something of macarthur  s gift for inspiring leadership  peck makes him a fine speaker  but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart . it is as if atticus finch from to kill a mockingbird  had put on a general  s uniform .  br    br   whereas scott attempted a warts and all  portrait of patton  the criticism has been made that macarthur  attempts to gloss over some of its subject  s less attractive qualities . i think that this criticism is a fair one  particularly as far as the korean war is concerned . the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering  militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp . many historians  of course  feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter  s conduct was becoming a risk to world peace  and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated . even during the korean scenes  peck  s macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real  life original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters .  truman  s remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday  was said about eisenhower  but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur  s approach to international diplomacy  . perhaps the film  s attempt to paint out some of macarthur  s warts reflects the period in which it was made . the late seventies  after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate  was a difficult time for america  and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation . another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools . if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur  something should have been shown of his early life  which is not covered at all .  the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines  . one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur  s father  himself a military hero . i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was  and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model . another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur  s clash with truman  with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them . the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches .  br    br   it would be wrong  however  to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether . although i may not have agreed with peck  s interpretation of the main role  there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness . the film as a whole is a good example of a solid  workmanlike biopic  thoughtful and informative . it is a good film  but one that could have been a better one .     .  br    br   on a pedantic note  the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz  the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war .  the pre  war boundary was the   th parallel  . also  i think that macarthur was referring to the

1,lorna green  janine reynaud  is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club . she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon . it  s quite possible that  through a form of hypnotic suggestion  someone  . . a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet  is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love  making is about to begin . after the murders within her fantasies are committed  lorna awakens bewildered  often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality .  br    br   if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco  i  d say it  s elegant  difficult . by now  you  ve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about  since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream . franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career  as far as film  making style  and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience . and  as you read from the reaction of the user comments here . . some like this decision  others find the style labouring  dull  and bewildering . i  ll be the first to admit that the film is over my head  but even franco himself  when quizzed by critics who watched  succubus   admitted that he didn  t even understand the film and he directed it  some might say that  succubus  was merely a precursor to his more admired work   venus in furs   considered his masterwork by franco  faithful  because it also adopts the surreal  dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn  t truly know whether he  she is experiencing something real or imagined . in a sense  like the protagonist  we are experiencing the same type of confusion . . certainly   succubus  is unconventional film  making where we aren  t given the keys to what is exactly going on . and  a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn  t help matters .  succubus  is also populated by beatnik types and  poet  speak   corman  s film   a bucket of blood  poked fun at . my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party . . quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually . great locations and jazz score . . i liked this film myself  although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction . loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna  a wee bit drunk  writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig  . . equally wasted  rush her in an embrace of kisses .  
0,i had never read gary paulsen  s novel  hatchet  for which  a cry in the wild  is the adaptation of  so i can  t make any comparisons to the book . i will  however  say that as a film on its own  adaptation or no adaptation  it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters .  br    br   think of  a cry in the wild  as a less luxurious  teenage mountaineer  was quincy  california the only place this was filmed   version of  cast away .  jared rushton is    year  old brian roebson  a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father  until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain  leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself .  br    br   there are basically three parts to the film . the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters  namely brian and his mom .  br    br   the next third of the movie  which really consumes nearly all of the film  is that of brian  roughing it .  these scenes contain no particularly amazing action  nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape . nothing to put you on edge  no real encounters  except a brisk confrontation with a cub   and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen . you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first  primitive means  and then more improved ones  using tools  etc  for his survival . it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation  and that is pretty much about it . in other words  they put no meat on the paulsen  s words when they translated them into a visual media .  br    br   and  of course  the third part of the movie is his rescue .  br    br   there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time  however . some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky  awkward relationship between them . however  for the most part  it is only explained in brief  intermittent  minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video . any minute  the singer from jefferson starship  should chime in an start singing  sara .  other than what the viewer can draw from the implications  or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative  we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters  whether or not it really had anything to do with brian  s survival adventure in the third part of the movie . these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and  for me  almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more   br    br   it certainly was not  for me  a good adventure tale . but  for fans of jared rushton  it was one of the last few movies he made . so  watch it purely for nostalgia  if nothing else .  
0,as a south african  it  s an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense   br    br   despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini  this  addition  to the series is appalling  the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist  leader and warrior . a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africa .  br    br   the plot of this film  however  is nothing but hogwash  scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid  nineties .  br    br   while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors  what is david hasselhoff doing here  rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile   br    br   i kept expecting blond  busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits  for no apparent reason . not that this would  ve been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after   pints of beer at a fancy dress party  where someone  s caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next  blockbuster  .  
0,being a music student myself  i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch . little did i know . . .  i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears  this movie was implausible throughout . it  s obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn  t know a thing about classical music . let me give you just a few examples   there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever  just having a nice pop voice isn  t enough  besides  that  s a different thing altogether  another genre  different technique . it  s like playing the violin when applying for a viola class .   how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury  if she wasn  t a singing professor herself  she would have no say in a situation like that  and if she was a singing professor  why weren  t we told so    being able to read music is a necessity if you  re to major in music .   how did angela get a hold of that video tape  that would have been kept confidential  for the jury  s eyes only . now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn  t have a clue . i wonder which . . .   the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she  had the range   which she clearly did not . yes  she was able to sing the notes  but carmen is a mezzo  soprano  while holly  s voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre  not at all compatible with that song .   worst of all not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music  but it doesn  t even try to hide it . the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition  a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital  where it is cut short in a disgraceful way  mozart would roll over in his grave . the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times  too  and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music  it  s stiff and boring but hey  add some drums and electric guitars and it  s almost as good as britney spears  i know these are all minor details  but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research . anyhow  i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated . but without that  i really can  t find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one it  s good for a laugh .  
0,every once in a while  someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks  what  s with snitch  d   i know immediately they have a case of barely  hidden amusement  horror . you see  i was the cinematographer on the film .  br    br   let me clarify some points regarding this  interesting life experience  .  br    br   originally  snitch  d was called one hard hit . i met james cahill in july of      a day after i wrapped triangle square  a great little   mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades . . . it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag  s notorious experimental feature contract . but i digress . . .  br    br   i though i was on a roll  and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in   mm with a shooting budget of about         not wanting to break pace  i took it . after all  clerks  el mariachi . . . i too believed the myth back then .  br    br   let  s just chalk it up as  film school  for many involved  myself included . snitch  d was shot over two weeks in august       in aliso viejo and santa ana  ca . cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city  yes  he is a drama and english teacher . . . consider that while watching the film  or even observing the use of apostrophe in title   hence the locations and cast .  br    br   of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l . a .  s channel  morning news weather girl vera jimenez  and of greater impact  the debut of eva longoria  who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt . i must say her professional dedication  focus and  let  s do this  attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom  yet  to  come .  br    br   snitch  d suffered from poor optics  few lights or electricity  several boom operators du jour  and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication . none of that overshadows the actual content  which speaks for itself .  br    br   anyway  by      the film was sold to distributors  at a net loss  i understand  who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box  by then she was a rising  working name  but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch  d . since cahill  s other passion is antiquarian book dealing  it appears to confirm he believes you can  in fact  judge a book by it  s cover . . . as so many have picked up this dvd based on it  s sleeve .                  one year later  eva  now on a soap  and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted  split second  which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent .  br    br    years later  i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez  mexico . i though he had worked out the process my participation was contingent on casting  script and crew control  and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies  for what it was . . . a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez despite claims here and elsewhere  the film has never appeared in any festival or venue  although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject  virgin of juarez and border town .  
0,william cooke and paul talbot share director  writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines . feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth . . . and a scroungy town tramp named ralph  gunnar hansen . . . of leatherface fame  wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire .  br    br   one tale is the old retread of  the hook   two teens on lover  s lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand . another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed . they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great st . as they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off . one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas  who can  t wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus . the fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies .  br    br   without a big budget for special effects  campfire tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse . a bit corny  but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale . the acting is understandably not award worthy . cast members include tres holton  courtney ballard  h . ray york  johnny tamblyn  walter kaufmann  kevin draine  david avin and paul kaufmann .  
0,just finished watching american pie beta house and i gotta say  this was such a garbage pile of crap . the first  american pies were hilarious  the last  were a joke and should not have been called american pie .  br    br   as you figured out from the title of the movie  beta house  is about a fraternity  freshmen  girls and  the most original part of them all  falling in love . of course  the guy that has his way with the chicks is stifler  who  along with his mates  tries to complete another apparently impossible task . it was unrealistic and super fake . its just really predictable and the plot is so weak . both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing  something like that  to sum it up awful acting  dull script  wrong use of the american pie franchise  total waste of time  this movie is unbearable . i give it a two out of ten  although most of it sucked there were lots of nudity and pretty girls  like  funny scenes    
1,jim carrey is back to much the same role that he played in the mask  a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums  and of course they have to be mexican  obviously   his good will towards his fellow man backfires . in that case  it wasn  t too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums  but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn  t be ignored . i  m reminded of the episode of michael moore  s brilliant the awful truth  when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . the results were not very promising  so it  s nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example .  br    br   jim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan  the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . or even better  it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere  a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film  . bruce is nearly   years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that  s seeking to bake the world  s biggest cookie . he  s desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station  but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . needless to say  he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film .  br    br   morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself  displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freeman  s massive talent as an actor . he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously  but in such a way as to advise his followers  as well as the viewers of this movie  that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . there are a lot of people in the world  maybe more than our share in america  who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans .  br    br   one of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives  and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer  s religion . i  for example  tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . but despite the fact that i don  t believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time  i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie .  br    br   jim carrey  s movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he  s come . if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura  both of which i loved  by the way  or a lot of what he did before he got into film  it  s amazing how far he  s come . he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show  man on the moon  and the majestic  easily one of his greatest films ever  . jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today .  br    br   jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie  as she did in the side  splitting office space  as bruce  s girlfriend  who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruce  s growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . there is definitely some low  brow comedy in the film that doesn  t really fit with the importance of the film  s meaning or the quality of the delivery  such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene  but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace ventura  s friend spike make a cameo appearance . as stephen king very well knows  it  s always nice to see familiar characters . it  s almost like seeing family again .  br    br   bruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better  and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . the thing i love about this is that  like i said before  religion is absent from my life  but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers . the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way  which empowers the message even more .  br    br   the scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film  such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position  the jimmy hoffa scene  who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records   the scene where bruce  s rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera  and my favorites  the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery  s cooking . the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes  such as when he says to god  who reveals that he  s the janitor  the proprietor  the electrician  etc  that his christmas parties must be real bashes  and to be careful about drinking  because on of him might need a ride home  i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . a little too true  and as gallagher would add  behind every great man is also an amazed mother  in  law .  br    br   bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while  and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection . it is a comedy written and performed in good taste  but with enough relatively low  brow humor to keep the kids entertained . this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family  which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie  which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy   it  s nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . don  t miss this one .  
0,words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is . i wish it were  so bad it  s good   but it  s not . it  s just dull  lifeless  and boring . it  s so bad i couldn  t even laugh at it .  br    br   in response to other posters  anne  marie frigon is not the highlight of the movie . the only person less charismatic is the director brett kelly  who as a true statement on vanity  cast himself as the male lead . they both look like inbreeds  sister and brother .  br    br   the gal  sherry thurig  is a looker . the complete opposite of anne  marie  attractive . this girl is tall and willowy  and can act . although you can tell she  s holding back .  br    br   all the actors seem to be holding back  especially the supporting male  mark . i  ve seen less wood in a rain forest  but he  s still better than kelly . why would kelly keep his actors from acting  is he really that bad a director  everyone else has summed the story up perfectly  there isn  t one . kids are kidnapped and kelly steps in poo to solve the crime . i know how he felt stepping in the poo  it  s how i felt after watching his movie .  br    br   yes  i tried to get my money back from the rental store . this is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director  and if you search them out  you  ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks  .  
0,i don  t see enough tv game shows to understand the attraction of show me the money  but i suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences . ostensibly a quiz show  it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions . however  its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings  which i find tortuously complicated . for example  before answering a question  a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random  a    b   or  c  choices . does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down  it would be a lot quicker simply to start with  a .  contestants can pass on questions  but must answer one of the three questions in each category .  br    br   after responding to a question  the contestant is then asked to  lock in  the answer   another delaying tactic . the contestant  s next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go  go dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth . a correct answer adds the card  s dollar figure to the contestant  s running total a wrong answer subtracts the same sum . this time  consuming step actually has some entertainment value  as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers . meanwhile  the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the  killer card  will end the game instantly . this naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars . my suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show  s chief audience appeal .  br    br   meanwhile  the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host william shatner and the contestant  along with occasional routines by the caged dancers . all these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed .  br    br   a typical    minute episode of jeopardy often gets through as many as   questions . the first   minutes of smtm that i watched got through only six questions  many of which pertained to other tv shows  . no one in his right mind would watch this show because it  s fun to play along by answering the questions at home . that leaves three possible reasons to watch the show .  br    br   a . to see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars  only to lose everything in one stroke .  br    br   b . to look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines .  br    br   c . to enjoy william shatner  s scintillating banter .  br    br   my choice is  b   but the women aren  t on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show .

1,  br    br   so  not being a poet myself  i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary . the effortless motion of goldsworthy  as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating . watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work  and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot . be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web .  br    br   the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself . it is in the essential change of nature where his work  though complete in its own sphere  is made whole .  
1,it was very heart  warming . as an expatriated french  i particularly enjoyed this  tv  movie  which i think deserves a broader distribution . the acting was good  and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so  br    br   strong and so natural . no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids . one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son  leo   who has contracted hiv  and the youngest son  marcel   to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation . the two characters  br    br   progressively explore each other as time runs out for leo  who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs . . .  
1,  before sunrise  is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top  favorite movies ever . dialog and acting are great . i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts . of course  the romantic vienna  introduced in the movie does not exist  you won  t find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night  and it isn  t possible to get to all the places in only one night  either  especially if you  re a stranger and it  s your first night in vienna  . but that  s not the point . the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic . although  nothing ever really happens  the movie never gets boring . the ending is genuinely sad without being  titanic  or something . even if you don  t like love stories you should watch this film  i  m a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer . the first part is perfect as it is  in my opinion .  
1,it sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings . by using the adjective  shocking  i do not intend to imply that i am surprised about the things told about in this film or that i was formerly unaware of them  it is just that i am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off  either with or without a  reason  .  br    br   the first part of the film focuses on hanna  s successful participation in the hungarian resistance . maruschka detmers would never have won an oscar for this performance  due to inconsistent directing  but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma . she is cast very well as hanna and immediately has our sympathy . her very beautiful looks help  of course  but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress  playing a good part .  br    br   certain inconsistencies keep occurring in hanna  s war . i sometimes get the idea director menahem golan  often despised for the gianni versace murder  was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene . on the other hand  i am very thankful he made this impressive and thought  provoking film and as i am very positive about it  i think he did a good job .  br    br   the second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one . it focuses on hanna  s suffering  beware of donald pleasence  s scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain rosza  and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war . i receive hanna  s war  especially the second half  as a strong anti  war film and for that alone golan deserves credit . it is also this second half in which maruschka detmer  s talent comes out  creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking  strong and tragic ever portrayed . it is also great to see ellen burstyn  whose appearance and acting style always remind me of romy schneider  who  had she been alive and cast  would have made a similar effective contribution to hanna  s war .  br    br   the tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected  so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears . and when i realized once more it wasn  t even fiction  it all actually happened  i found myself in even more tears . the image of hanna portrayed by maruschka detmers will be in my mind forever .  
0,why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap  my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it . i can  t imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it . also  there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie . he was uncredited but his list of roles here  imdb  does give him credit . btw . . . rain is his sister for those who have were asking before . this film is proof that no matter how many big  names  you have . sow  s ears don  t make silk purses . i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad  sad  sad . . . maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film . it has no endearing  entertaining  or even comedic properties in comparison to it  s bad everything else .  
0,though not a fan of sam rockwell  i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of  joshua .  heck  i wasn  t even aware he was in  joshua  until i started the movie . so it goes without saying  i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie  not the leads . a sort of  rosemary  s baby    the omen  or any other demonic kid movie  joshua  was billed . unfortunately  it fell flat . slow  incredibly slow  and flat . yet  i continued on to see how this would all resolve  hoping beyond belief  the ending climax would shed some light on the subject . okay  i admit  it did  a wee bit  but what a stale closing . and what a low  low budget movie  or at least that  s how they designed it . a person falls  you don  t see the drop  you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood . a person gets hit by a cab  you don  t see it  you see someone complaining  holding a bike up . i  m not sure if this is called  style  or laziness or simply  lack of funds for special effects . we have a  rich  family with a crazy mom  a workaholic father attempting to balance everything  a kid  joshua  who may  may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot . she cries as much as we see how many days she  s alive  and what was that about  are there rats above or is it joshua  is his mother nuts  is joshua crazy  is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family  is he going to grow up to be michael myers  or does he drive his family to the brink  i don  t think so . they were nuts prior  and no  so  called  acting could make me believe otherwise . unfortunately  barely any questions were answered  barely any open doors shut . i  m sure that might have been the idea  but for pete  s sake  give me something . anything . there are plenty better kid  gone  wild movies to explore . joshua  s more like the mini  me of the antichrist .  
0, . . . that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful  oscar  winning performance . one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx  s performance in  ray  was because from watching his hammy  obnoxious acting in movies like  bait  and  booty call   i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar . if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar  i would laugh right in their faces . who knows  maybe he  s better off sticking to drama  because if you watch  bait   it  s clearly evident that comedy is not his forte . i swear  jamie mugs so much in this movie that i  m surprised his face didn  t fall off . and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets  anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn  t require being loud and obnoxious . if a joke is funny  it  s funny . if it  s not funny  then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier . the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character . in real life  normal people don  t always have witty comebacks and quips . like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in  taxi driver   it  s important to be funny as your character  rather than be funny as a comedian . a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken  and he starts posing for the photographs like a model . if a regular person were being thrown in jail  would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken  and wouldn  t the police try to scold him if he was  there are many scenes like that throughout the film . another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain  and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent . not funny  not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke . giving a comedic performance requires patience  whereas he goes straight to the punchline  whether it  s the right time for it or not . i  m not even a big mike epps fan  but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie  s . as a matter of fact  this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen . epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy  but at least he chooses a more low  key approach . one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse  a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains . he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality . however  fellow  green mile  star doug hutchison is disgustingly over  the  top as the villain . a big surprise  considering he gave a superb performance in  the green mile   also playing a heavy . antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like  the replacement killers  and  training day .  even in  bait   he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence . his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx  who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another . unless you  re a die  hard fan of foxx  please don  t take the bait .  
0,how wonderful . yet another movie about america by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times  a day a piece  and believes himself to be an  expert  on the country . sheesh . i should take a trip to germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about germany as the  land of nazis  or some such . wim il boy  you should get together with lars von trier and make the ultimate movie about the americans . of course we all know it takes a pretentious left  leaning  we are the world  european to make a  real  movie about america .  br    br   yeah  right . for a continent that started not one but two world wars  europe sure has a lot of opinions about america  s wrong  foreign policy  .  br    br   p . s . don  t worry  wim il boy  there  s plenty of uc  berkeley americans that  ll just love your movie . of course  these are the same people who thinks george w . bush is worst than hitler  and that a painting of a can of soup is  sheer genius     
0,this is only the second time i  ve felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film . the first time was for probably the best movie i  ve ever seen and that was for memento .  br    br   seeing darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento  as in the worst film i  ve had the misfortune to see . apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash  pile that it is .  br    br   let  s see  apalling effects  cliched script  bad acting and about   minutes too long . my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad . amazingly i watched it to the end  how i did that i don  t know  avoid     
1,ever since i remember  i have loved airplanes and flying . i am now in college with a private pilot  s license and looking to become a commercial . i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me  this was it . my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid . i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re  cite it today . it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd  s soon  it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless . i cannot get enough of this show .  
0,i watched the whole movie  waiting and waiting for something to actually happen . maybe it  s my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology  is it a weird re  telling of the oedipal myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him  i didn  t understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs  why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so  why have the scenes at all with the father at work  why have such a nice kitchen if you  re only going to eat takeout  why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around . i see lots of good reviews for this movie . . . has my taste been corrupted by going up with   s b  movies and old sci fi flicks   
0,giant crabs cursing in japanese  what was in that drink  a terrible movie  but laughable . i love the invisible samurai ghosties running around . drink much beer before you see this movie .  
0,oh my god what the hell happened here    i  m not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this  the dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in  king kong vs godzilla   linda miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy . its about some villain called dr . who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as king kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap kong . when he does  thats when linda miller gets annoying  he makes kong his slave but everything goes wrong and king kong escapes . then dr . who sends the robot after him .  br    br   later when i was watching the movie i got a headache when linda miller and the other clowns started moaning . as i sat through the misery of watching the dvd while it was playing i was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight . the ending has to be a really bad one because they could  ve shown kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again .  br    br   don  t watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do . . . beware of the disappointment you will receive .  
0,as a big fan of the original film  it  s hard to watch this show . the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake . the mood is never there . instead  it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies . crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff  but his snappy wardrobe and  swank  apartment don  t fit the mood of the original  or make him an interesting character . he does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice . the english accent and california looks can  t hold a candle to barbara stanwick  s velvet voice and sex appeal . lee j . cobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyes  but even his performance is just gruff  without style .  br    br   it feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is .  
0,a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one . it needed some dependence on something .  br    br   this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people . were they trying to imitate the wonderful film  crash   if so  this film crashed entirely .  br    br   there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem .  br    br   the film is just too choppy to work . one woman loses her husband after   years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor . this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing . the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance .  br    br   then  we have  losers who purchase masks to rob a bank . obviously  the robbery goes awry but there doesn  t seem to be any punishment for the crooks . perhaps  the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film .  
1,i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago  but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking . it sparked my interest  but i never expected it to be this great . before sunrise is a masterpiece  and it  s also one of the most romantic films on record . to my surprise  it completely lacked the cynicism of the     s . it  s impossible to really talk too much about it  since there is no real plot  so to speak  although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre  where there is a conversation  but it  s not just the conversation that matters   but let me just say  see it . see it   
0,i saw this on dvd  its known as corrupt in this format  and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitels character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in  this gritty and powerful police thriller  . what the casing didnt mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo  well when a character plays music he doesnt put on the cd player  he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing  puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film  the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made   years ago . its also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rottens performance is bizarre rather than terrible  the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy  i dont know if its down to a dodgy dvd or if its a very bad film print  and worst of all is ennio morricones score . its impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns .  br    br   all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . its by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didnt match up to his high standards  
0,well  maybe i  m just having a bad run with hindi movies lately . i asked the video store guy for apharan  prakash jha  but being a new release  wasn  t available yet . so i had to settle for this one . it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i  ve seen  and i  ve seen quite a few  . no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world  if imdb had negative ratings  i would give garam masala a    .  br    br   i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai . all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up . for some strange reason  people expect good stuff from piyadarashan . i did not like hulchul  hungama  or his other films . hulchul  probably dubbed from tamil or telugu  came across as very loud  in  your  face fare that again didn  t make much sense except in a bollywood flick . this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains . who made him a director  even a bollywood director at that     br    br   anyhow  to the film now . what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non  sensical woman  hunt . two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment  isn  t it similar to no entry where the  dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office  jezuz christ  now they  re copying their own stories   well anyways  there  s some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi  lateral love  aka multi  tasking  multi  timing  . what happened in the end  i  ve no idea . i switched off mid  way . what ridiculous junk . i can  t believe they even released it . and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth  for which audience did they make it  the poor illiterate indian masses     mil at last count  or the well  heeled nri desis staying in phoren  either ways it doesn  t matter . neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god  awful stuff .  br    br   its a short review because there  s nothing to write about but the usual bag of f  grade garbage . bollywood should change its name to follywood . and yes  this review is much better than the movie itself .  
0,if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars  you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel  being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel   and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time  then this is the documentary for you . admitedly i didn  t watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism  but that was enough for me . maybe the rest is even better .  br    br   i wonder how long it  s going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies . perhaps game shows based on self  mutilation might be nice .  br    br   i already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen . i don  t need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment .  
0,this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man  turned  flying demon is let loose on the world . the cgi is par for a tv job  and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine . familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby  s mentor  but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level . we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start  a bad sign . also  the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable . they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies  most notably remo williams .  
0,superhero movies pretty much always suck  and this is no exception . its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse . i would put  batman  robin  and  steel  above this movie  so yes it is that bad . . .  br    br   if your looking for a black superhero  check out  blankman  its not a  serious  superhero movie but at least its entertaining .  
0,the plot was predictable  and fighting with guns gets old  but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low iq and don  t really care about real movies . i would endulge in true art movies  like  clerks    something about mary    el mariachi   or  la taqueria  .  
0,unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid  euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . my points  br    br   film is based on  things  br    br     ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films  the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning  or  things about the asian culture . but unfortunately it is not enough . knowing kunefe and  names of other foods doesn  t make a person understand a culture . for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . lebanese people are christian  ok they got that  and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries . the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don  t make ethnocentrism . so we don  t judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film .  br    br     sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this . show me   girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong .  br    br   i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . please watch dr . strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . where is the truth  where is the meaning about the movie .  
1,touching well directed autobiography of a talented young director  producer . a love story with rabin  s assassination in the background . worth seeing   br    br    
1,this is a truly classic movie in its story  acting  and film presentation . wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie  miss sullivan  and jimmy stewart being the foremost characters . in real life she greatly admired  and liked jimmy  and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles  and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set . the  chemistry  between the two was always apparent  and so warm and enjoyable to behold . she was such a beautiful  young woman  and so sweet in her personality portrayals . the story of these two young people  and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch  and pure magical entertainment . heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story  movie . i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect   in this golden age cinema classic  that has a special appeal for all generations . a must see for all   
0,why review good movies when you can review  trancers ii    br    br   ooh  this film is soooo lame . i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l . a . with a camcorder  hurling extras in silly monster make  up at poor  long  suffering tim thomerson . the stars  families actually turn up to play cameos  probably because full moon couldn  t afford  real  extras . lame effects  lame sets  and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots  this must be classic trancers   br    br   and yet . . . and yet . . . it rules . note this is the same thing i say about  trancers iv .  i say it because it  s true . what can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies  then bust out with quips like   don  t worry ladies  they  re bio  degradable   well  lots of things could be better  but anyway this is still good stuff .  br    br   my only significant reservation is megan ward  who really stinks up the joint . she  s a lousy rival for helen hunt  s character  they  re both young pieces of eye candy  and it would  ve been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more . oh well  you can  t have everything . at least the wonderful plot device of the  long second watch  is back in place  and we  ve got more of hap ashby  the least  convincing athlete in the history of cinema  oh  wait a minute  he  s got a rival in the form of david ogden steirs in  creator   .  br    br   i haven  t seen this lately  but i do seem to remember that martine beswick runs away twice during the final battle . hooray for lousy continuity  just one of the many highlights in this fine film .  
0,this movie is complete crap  avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs  it is rambling and incoherent . i pride myself on plumbing the depths of    s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty . i like being shocked  but i need a coherent story . however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you . the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang . i mean its just plain hard to sit through  not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly . please  i know the cover is interesting  what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman  s bare ass  but don  t waste your time or money as you won  t get either back .  
0,this may very well be the worst movie i  ll see if i live to be    . i think a group of first  graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this . i  m dumber for having watched it  and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film .  br    br   and after i finally turned it off  i actually had the urge to vomit .  br    br   no one had a clue about photography when made this . no one had a clue about acting . no one had a clue about just about anything .  br    br   i can  t believe f  x shows this crap on occasion . the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz  channels  not even the main one . and it was on at about  a . m . at that .
