1,"Love this butterfly pendant. Right size, high quality and elegant design. Plus, it is really easy to wear and remove all by myself, no help needed."
0,"The locket has a very nice appearance and there is a inner plastic cover that holds the photo in nicely. The negative is the very little use of silver in this locket, there is absolutely no heft to this, it almost feels like it is made out of foil. Opening the locket is very difficult and it felt like it would just break because it had to be pried on so much to open. Being somewhat handy I was able to adjust the latch to a more reasonable level."
0,"I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother. Both arrived with very badly tarnished chains (about half the chain rust colored on both). In addition, the actual pendants were scratched and ""used looking""."
1,"A beautiful, delicate little bracelet. I feel I ""got what I paid for""....something that does not happen too often these days!!!!"
0,"when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?"
0,"Its not surgical steel, its like. chrome or something. It totally rusted!!! But it looks cute none the less."
1,Got to me pretty quickly and there were no unpleasant surprises. looks exactly like the picture!
1,"Being a Born Again Christian of Jewish descent, I am thrilled with the Star of David/Cross Pendant. It is beautiful. I haven't taken it off since it arrived.I am more than pleased with the quality of the pendant and the service."
0,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
0,"Bracelet was nice and as described. Clasp is hard to work and stones have very little purple color. However, I think it is a fair value."
0,"but when you put the necklace on, you can't even see either the sparkle, or the beauty of it. The stones are very small, which is expected. What is not expected is that the stones are linked by 3...(Meaning, 3 stones seem to be soldered together, then connected to 3 more stones, etc.) This made for an awkward appearance when worn since it's not ""fluid."" In other words, the necklace would ""flip"" constantly, and all you saw was silver and not the ""topaz.""I considered keeping it anyways because the price was great, the stones are sparkly and the color pretty, but the 18"" wouldnt fit 3x around my wrist (2x made it too large) to be worn as a bracelet of some sorts.Unfortunately, this will have to go back. I wish it was better designed for more movement of each stone so that it laid better against the skin."
1,"My husband purchased this ring as my belated engagement ring in January, and it is simply breathtaking... much bigger than it seems in the pictures...and so much more beautiful. I will treasure it forever."
0,"For the money ~ I was very disappointed in these earring and I wrote to the seller right a way.I had to go away on a family reunion but I did not even bring them ~ they are not classey looking at all. For Chalcedony I was so sadly let down. Think Twice is my advice! Lynn C. ~ South Jersey, N. J."
1,One of my best friends wanted these for her birthday. She got them and loved them. She said they looked just as nice in person as the picture shows.
1,My daughter's nick name is Banana and I wanted a charm to wear with some other charms from my husband. This little banana charm was exactly what I was looking for!
1,"Very small, but very pretty. I wear it often :) I get many compliments on it as well."
1,"I received the necklace in time for Christmas, it was smaller than I expected, however, it was sized appropriately for my granddaughter. She was very please with her gift."
1,My girlfriend absolutely loved this. She really isn't a jewelry person and is very hard to pick stuff out for but she wears this constantly. Its smaller than I imagined it but I think that is why she liked it so much. She has gotten a lot of compliments while wearing it.The chain did end up breaking but it was her fault and not really a product defect she took her shirt off while it was still on and the chain got caught on her shirt as she did that and snapped. Just bought a replacement chain and she is wearing it all the time again.
1,i gave this as a gift for my friend she love it. i like it so much that i am ordering another for me. looks beautiful well crafted.thank you so much.
1,I gave it to my son's teacher last Christmas and she said she loved it!!!! It got a lot of compliments. Wished I bought one for myself:(
0,I bought this ring to wear to work during my pregnancy because my gold ring did not fit anymore. It worked great as a replacement and kept it's shine for months. Definitely worth it.
1,"This ring was perfect for what I wanted - size was correct. Although a bit bright when it arrived, with wear it looks more and more like the real thing! Can't beat the price."
1,"I just received my band and it is exactly what I wanted. I have small fingers and the karat weight is just right, and it has sparkle similar to my real eternity band. I am a nurse and worry about my real diamonds so this is the perfect substitute...no one will know the difference. It would be a great stackable as well, and wish I had ordered a second, which I still may do. Great first jewelry experience with Amazon. What a bargain too!"
1,"This is great ring! I bought this to wear daily .. my wedding band has well lets say, my fingers have swelled as I have aged. This looks allot more geniune in person. I was not looking for anything that spectacular and something not remotely expensive. I have received allot of compliments and I dont worry about it not being ""real"""
1,"This ring is very pretty and definitely looks more expensive than purchase price. For me the sizing was accurate (8). The stones are small, as pictured, but sparkle."
0,"I was excited to order this ring. I have developed an allergy to my white gold wedding set and needed something sterling silver to wear. The price is certainly right on this ring, but it isn't really convincing enough to pass as the real deal. I had decided to keep it since it was okay for the price, but I ordered the wrong size and sent it back anyway."
1,"Very pretty, dainty ring. Comfortable. I really love the fact that it's sterling silver. I don't know why ring manufacturers use rhodium plated standard silver instead of sterling. It looks much more like 14K white gold and also the weight is more like 14K. The ring is the right size and very thin and light which I love. My real ring scratches my fingers and gets caught in my hair! This is an improvement."
1,I truly do love this ring! Everything written about this ring is so true! I would tell everyone this is a spectacular bargain!
1,This is a beautiful ring that fits great. I bought this about 6 months ago and i don't have a single complaint about it. I wear it everyday :)
1,This ring is everything it looked on line. It is very pretty and fits nicely under another ring. And you can't beat the price! I've gotten more expensive rings and had the Zirconia fall out within a few weeks but this one seems very well put together.
1,"Nicely priced ring for sterling. It sparkles nicely for being small stones, and overall quality is nice and fits great. Fast delivery!"
1,I needed something simple to wear at work instead of my large diamond. This ring is perfect! The item arrived as stated online and in record speed for being around the holidays and delivery to Alaska. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend to others. And how can you go wrong for that price?!
0,I wore it once and a stone has already fallen out. Spent way too much money for that to be acceptable.
1,Bought the star version of this necklace and it was lovely. The 8 year old that I bought it for just loved it and it looked beautiful.
0,I purchased the ring just days before christmas and just in time too. With weeks of studying I was sure this would have been the best choice but I was ashamed to give the ring to my fiance because it was so poor of quality. Her father is a jewlery desiner and appraised the ring for me. I def. didnt like the feedback I got from him. I have rated this item a 3 because I should have known better then to order a Diamond ring online. Good luck to all!
1,"I really like these earrings. For such a small item there's a lot of detail on the mane and tail. The width of the earrings is 7/8 inch. The height is 3/4 inch. If they were a full circle they'd be about as big as a quarter. They look delicate, but they're sturdy. The ones I received look just like the online picture. If you're a horse lover you will really like these."
1,"Earrings are well-made..I love the stone color..Jewelery comes in cute boxes, various shapes and colors. My order arrived in record time. They have my business."
1,I love these hematite earrings. They're known to 'ground' you. I wear these a lot!
0,Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear....
1,"It has a very simple setting, but that only lets the beauty of the stone shine more! GREAT clarity and design, I am thrilled with this purchase as I have been with all my Peora purchases!"
1,"the color is rich and deep gorgeous blue, great sparkle with a modern and unique setting. Band is thin and bright, shows off the setting and stone beautifully. If you love Blue Topaz and are looking for a terrific deal, this looks much richer and expensive than it is."
1,The ring is beautiful. You dont usually see this sparkle and color with cz. Its the perfect size. Any smaller it wouldnt be worth it. Any larger and it would look fake. Awsome purchase!!!
1,I wear this ring everyday & I constantly get compliments on it! It's very beautiful & a great ring for the price. I'd recommend it to anyone...!!
1,I just received my ring and it is incredible! It looks so real and the clarity and cut is awesome. I am pairing it with an eternity wedding band and it couldn't be better! I read the other reviews and was a little skeptical but I am so glad that I ordered the ring before it sold out in my size. Thanks Amazon and Gem Avenue!
1,The ring is beautiful! It is a little on the larger side but the setting and stone itself look very real. The stone is brilliantly clear. I paired it with a plain 3mm sterling silver band by the same seller and it looks wonderful. Shipping was extraordinarily fast! I'd definately recommend this ring to anyone.
1,"If you are looking for a ring with a dainty stone this isn't the one. This ring has a ROCK. I wasn't expecting the stone to be so big, but now that I have worn it for a little while, and gotten used to it, I love it. It is beautifully made and very shiny. Looks expensive."
1,"Not at all heavy - but not flimsy either - so they're really comfortable to wear. Well made, very shiny. The moldavite could be taken for peridot, it's paler than the photo. Really cute earrings and fantastic value for money."
1,"These earrings are very dainty, but also very attractive. Lovely to wear at Christmas or any time of year. The quality is very good and they are also very comfortable to wear. I have had no problems with them slipping out of my ears. You'll love them!"
0,"When I ordered this locket, I expected to receive a beautiful, antique-looking locket, that looked the same in the picture as it did in my hand. I was extremely disappointed. The locket itself is made of cheap, thin metal. The ""antique"" effect is just black paint in the creases. It appears as if the locket was dipped in motor oil, but not thoroughly cleaned. The chain is almost as bad. It is very bulky, much larger than it looks in the picture. AND the chain broke seconds after I got it out of the package (although the package was quite nice). To prospective buyers, don't waste your money. This necklace belongs in the garbage can, end of story."
1,This ring is absolutely beautiful. I get lots of compliments on this ring. It looks even better on your hand! Quick shipping and I acutally bought the wrong size and returning was easy for exchange.
1,i was really surprised at the quality of this VERY inexpensive piece- LOVE IT
1,"I received this piece just a couple of days, and I love it! I don't want to take it off. It's so beautiful, and very eye catching. The picture here on amazon doesn't quite do it justice.I have found though that the metal is fairly flexible, one night sleeping with it on, the chain got tangled and bent one of the spirals. So, I no longer sleep with this piece.The back is also already scratched up just a little bit.So, though amazingly beautiful, it does appear that the piece is a bit delicate, and care should be taken.It came in a little bag, which I assume storing it in helps to keep it from tarnishing.Also, the center triangle,and the center space of each spiraled, seems almost to be ""colored"" black. Like someone colored it in with a black pen.Despite it's fragility, I would buy it again, and think it's one of the most beautiful Triskele's I've seen."
1,"I love this pendant. I've been wearing it every day for a while now, and I always get compliments on it."
0,"I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping, spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement, I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable."
0,"I wish I had checked the shape of my old nose screw because this one didn't fit me. :( Supposedly this jewelry corresponds to a left nostril piercing, but that is certainly not my experience. All the ""left nostril"" nose screws shown by Body Candy look like this item, but my own personal nose screw - that actually fits in my left nostril - looks like the ones they advertise as ""right nostril"" nose screws. I am perplexed!Aside from that, it is good quality but DOES look much smaller than its stated gauge. I got a s.steel nosering from the same company and it doesn't look as small, so maybe it's because it's gold. Not sure which nose screw to choose now..."
0,"As the first review said, they didn't make my ears turn green but the earring itself turned black. I wore them for about 6 months before the stones fell out on a few of them. I'm going to purchase them again though because they're a decent deal. I'd rather pay $15 every 6 months than have to shell out $90 on a single pair of white gold earrings (I have 3 holes in each ear)."
0,"item arrived damaged but company provided replacement efficiently and without any hassle. polite, prompt and efficient service. attractive bracelet. the silver beads on the bracelet are a little cheap looking but as they age and oxide they will look better...."
1,Beautiful! The item makes me feel sexy :) It is simple yet classy. Would definitely buy from this seller again. Good value for the money.
0,"I was not very empressed with this item. It was advertised as a 10 inch, but it was very tight and I was nogt able to wear it."
1,This is a beautiful piece of jewelry! Simple yet elegant. I really love this ankle bracelet!
1,I bought this ankle bracelet as a gift for my granddaughter to celebrate her becoming a young woman. It will fit her for years to come. She absolutely adores it and wears it constantly. I would definitely make this purchase again. In fact I plan to order one for myself.
1,"I loved the quality of this anklet so much that I went back and purchased a bracelet, earrings and necklace. The pieces are more beautiful than in the picture. I would recommend Gem Avenue to all of my friends."
0,"These bracelets are so flimsy, skinny that they bend before you can even put them on. At first it seemed like good value, but they are not worth even $200.00 that I paid for each. Spend more to get something that doesn't collapse."
0,I don't like to reView things. It was okay but a little big for a phone charm
1,Fast delivery. Very pleased with earrings. Lovely gift for a friend who just loved them.
1,The earrings arrived in time for my niece's birthday. They are a medium pink with pearly undertones.Good value for the money.
0,"This item is priced well, but it is WAY too small to engrave anything on that anyone could read - not to mention that the back is not smooth, it's 'pebbly'. The best use for it is to hang it off an existing medical id bracelet near the clasp, so that if the face plate is turned around, the caduceus is visible."
1,Exactly as I pictured it. The charm is small enough to fit on a zipper. It is well made and has a nice weight to it. Just what I wanted.
1,This turquoise ring is as pretty as the picture advertised; the black lines are just as deep. It wears quite well and is as solid as expected. You will have no regrets on this purchase.
1,Such a pretty ring! I would order a size up....or at least a half a size up. Because it's stone there isn't much leeway. But it's a really gorgeous ring...I love how the natural colors weave together. And the little box it came in was super cute!
1,I received my turquoise band today.It came in a beautiful pink box with bow on top.The band is lovely.I am going to order another one.
1,"This size is for a female. nice fit.don't know if it helps with pain but I feel great, also my exercising 3 times a week does help also."
1,"It was a pleasure doing business with this company. I received the product in a timely manner. The medical alert necklace cost much less than I could find anywhere else. If I had had to get the alert necklace engraved (which this one already came engraved), it would have cost me at least 3 time more than the cost of a blank necklace. The engraving was clear. Thank you."
1,"This medical alert bracelet gives me the comfort of knowing that if i am unable to speak for myself for any reason, medical personel can know right away important information they might need to help me"
1,"This is a sturdy necklace that clearly marks ""anticoagulant"". I wear it when I go to the gym and it holds up well. The chain is decent quality. I reccommend."
0,"Photograph of the item is stunning however; upon opening the package the actual item looks extremely small. I have a hard time believing the before discount price is correct. The included gift box is small, and feels cheap. If I could have seen this item in store before purchase I would have passed."
1,"This belly button ring is perfect. I was worried that the dangling penguin would either get caught on my clothes, or get squished just from normal day-to-day activities that it would break off, but I've had it in 24/7 for a couples months now with no problems. I love penguins and this belly button ring is just absolutely perfect! Even the shipping was quick!"
1,"Moveable Sterling Silver Sea Nymph Mermaid Pendant on Black Cord NecklacePretty Necklace, but larger than I expected. It has cz 'nipples' which I thought was interesting. I like it though. Not sure I think it's worth $30 plus shipping that included a cheap velveteen kind of bag. It would have been nice to have a box, considering the price."
1,"I bought this for my girlfriend, who's been looking at this for awhile now. Great condition, looks like I bought it brand new from the store. Very fast shipping, too! I bought this only a few days ago."
1,"It's ok, I guess. I mean, it's a regular chip stretch bracelet. It's fine. The stones are pretty. I recommend."
1,The picture doesn't show you how pretty this bracelet is. I love wearing it with any outfit and love showing it off. Everyone loves it and asks where i got it.
0,"Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice, one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part, it might hang at its longest nicely.However, the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure, it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However, the openings in the adornment beads is so small, I doubt purchasing a separate chain would work. While the chain might fit through the beading and the bail for the medallion itself, I have yet to figure out how to get the loop at the beginning of the chain (that the lock attaches to) through the beads to begin the threading process. Don't think there is a chain out there small enough to fit yet strong enough to hold. Now, if one wanted to remove the loop for the closure on a chain, thread the chain through the beads and medallion and then reattach the closure loop, I am sure that would work. I just don't want to go through all that work. This is going back.p.s. I also purchased, at the same time, the Wolf Tooth necklace. Same holds true for that one. And in the picture online, the wolf's head appears to have varied colors on it distinguishing it from the 'tooth'. However, mine is all the same color so, once again, unless one looks closely, it is difficult to determine what the medallion actually is. The cord is the same as above. This one is also going back.The Wolf Earrings, on the other hand, while small, are great. Sturdy post that doesn't seem as if it will bend easily. These are very small so look best as a second piercing adornment, but can be worn alone for a more subdued look.The Wolf Cuff bracelet is nice, and looks much sturdier than it is. The first time I put it on and tried to gently bend the sides to fit my wrist better as one must do with most cuffs, the section where the wolf is attached got 'bend marks' in it. So now the cuff looks like a 3-sided box - actual bend marks showing top and both sides. I'll keep it because I bent it but doubt I'll wear it often."
1,I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she absolutely loved it. She says that she wears it often and gets many compliments. The bracelet arrived on time and it came in a great gift box! Thank you very much. I will be ordering from Harris Michael again really soon.
1,It looks JUST like the one in the movie! Absolutely beautiful! I wear mine almost every day. I get so many compliments! It's not too big or too small. I havent had a bit of problems with it and I'm so glad I purchased this ring.
1,"This is a great necklace! The color is amazing, it's bright and clear. The gemstones in the picture are darker than the actual necklace you receive. The stones are more of an icy green peridot set in a shimmering silver setting. No matter what lighting you are sitting in the necklace just glows. The necklace is petite but sturdy. You will love it."
1,"Can't actually say I've listened to all the mixes on the single, but I know they kick... D'ya like trance/euro with a few liricks... ...a nice song ? ...paul oakenfold...slacker... It'll beat your usual pop shet anyday. Gonna buy it now...F(UK)"
0,"It was just ""okay."" I sent it back, but only because I needed a special piece for a wedding. This would have fit the bill, if it weren't for the fact that it was jointed and wouldn't lay flat. Because it kept twisting and turning, you lost the look of it. Also the clasp was very small and hard to open. It took me about five minutes to get the necklace off by myself. In the end, I decided that it was a bit too ""chokery"" in length, and I needed something longer... maybe 18"" instead of 16"". So the search continues. But I have to say... if you are looking for a unique choker, this is a nice and unique piece of jewelry. The stones were nice, the purple was as pictured on-line... not pale like a lot of the amethysts you get on the net. And the silver was pretty... nice and shiny, obviously sterling. It's a good value, if that style is what you're after."
1,These delicate earrings are a lovely addition to other pieces from the Peora London Blue Topaz collection. We added these earrings to a ring and necklace to create a beautiful set for our daughter; whose birthday is in December.She is as delighted with the quality and craftsmanship of the earrings as we are. They look lovely on the ear; especially if one's hair is short or worn swept away from the ear. The earrings are the perfect size for looking elegant. We are most pleased with our purchase!
1,Every mother needs a cameo of their child. It makes a great gift for a new mother. The quality of this product is very good.
1,"This vendor shipped promptly. The cameo is beautiful and I would purchase from them again, in fact, I intend to purchase another cameo."
1,This cameo is a perfect gift for a new mother. It is beautifully made and appears to be of high quality. I gave it to my daughter to commemorate her child's first birthday and it was a great hit.
1,I ordered this Guardian Angel cameo for my 6-year-old daughter and was very impressed with the quality of the necklace when I received it. She saves it for extra special occasions and really treasures it. Thank you for creating such a nice product.
0,"Jewish star was purchased for my adult son. Although it is attractive, it is much too flimsy for a man to wear. I was very disappointed with the weight of the star, also. It appear in the picture to be a more substantial piece of jewelry."
1,This came in a little velvet bag and was exactly what I was looking for. It appears to be of good quality and made a perfect gift for my Mother. She was pleased with it as well.
1,I baught this cow charm to put on a necklace for my gf. It was exactly what i was looking for. She loved it.
1,The small cow is so cute. It looks very nice on a silver chain & will be a great gift for someone who likes cows.
0,This is a cute little shamrock charm... but I'm not a fan of the CHINA stamp on the back of it that is about half the width of the back. But the front is really cute.
1,I just loved this for my daughter's charm bracelet. She's turning 16 in a few months.
1,"The charm is more lovely than the picture. A precious color of pink. In addition the charm arrives in a small navy velvet bag which is placed in a navy box. So is a very elegant presentation.Lastly, it arrived just 2 days after purchase selecting the free shipping option."
0,I was disappointed in these earring. They were very small and not very detail. It was not a good purchase
0,These are really pretty but you can barely make out that they are ballet slippers. They are really TINY. We bought them for an 8 year old. Would have been small enough for a 0-2 year old.
0,"Bought these in advance as a gift for my daughter's fifth birthday. Was checking them before I wrapped them, and one of the posts fell off in my hand before she even wore them."
1,"This charm was a gift for my 10 year old niece. While the bale is more for a bracelet, it also goes well on a chain. She currently is wearing it on her neck and has not taken it off for a week. For the price you would not expect the detail, spinning wheels nor size. It's a fabulous value. I will definitely be coming back for more charms from Amazon"
1,"My girlfriend just love it, excelente product, I strongly recommend for people who wants to give a present regarding fashion :)"
0,"It is very small and lacks detail. I don't even know what to do with it, I just put it away when it came."
1,MY ITEM CAME PROMPTLY & WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE. GREAT SERVICE. WILL DEFINATLY DO BUSINESS WITH SELLER AGAIN.
0,"When I opened the box I actually thought they forgot to include the pendant in with the chain. Then inside a tiny piece of tissue paper was a microscopic pendant. Considering I just purchased a cross from Ireland twenty times the size of this for only $20 more, you know this is going back. This is even too tiny for an infant."
1,Was very pleased with the sterling silver children's ballet slippers pendant and to say the least my two Granddaughter were very pleased too.
0,I thought this was the necklace that went with the Silver Slippers book. The pendant (ballet shoes) is so small you can hardly see it. It looks to be less than a 1/4&#34;. I was very surprised.
0,"This Pendant is so small, you can't really tell what it is from more than a foot away. If I had paid five dollars for this, I would have felt ripped off. $20 for this piece of junk is insane."
1,"This bracelet is too cute and perfect for the little ""big"" girl in your life! It's grown-up enough to where your little angel will feel like a big girl, but sturdy enough to survive little girl antics! A great gift any ladybug lover is sure to love!"
1,"I absolutely love this beautiful pendant and gold chain. The Star of David is smaller than I anticipated, which is good. I was afraid it might be too large. Perhaps I'll buy another chain or two, different lengths or styles, to switch the pendant between.Additionally, I am pleased to be able to wear this pendant and chain while playing guitar without it banging into the back of the instrument and possibly ruining the finish. It is extremely annoying to be playing my guitar while my necklace keeps tapping or knocking up against the back of the guitar and not even be in sync with the beat.Most importantly, this pendant brings me joy to wear a symbol of my faith which reflects the beauty of Judaism."
1,These are a great way to keep your multiple remotes organized and your tabletop clutter free. I bought 2 of the black.
1,I loved this crab! I bought the charm intending to give it as a gift..but I was so charmed I made a bracelet for myself! The stones are more pinky than a red.
0,"Just like the picture but smaller than I wanted. I sometimes, collect various crab items, this was to add to my Granddaughter's collection. But a little too small, otherwise pretty."
1,"My best friend, of 30+ years, is a Cancer. I'd searched for 20 years for a tiny crab charm and finally found this adorable sterling silver, ruby encrusted, crab charm. She was delighted by it; and told me she'd been looking for one since she was a teenager."
0,"I found these cufflinks to be poor quality and barely resembling the photo in the listing. The silver tone film had bubbles on the face of the piece, the craftmanship was rough and inprecise. Overall, I was quite dissapointed. The vendor handled the return satisfactorily, promptly and courteously."
0,shines nice light weight but the bottom is very thin. would think the thickness at the top would be all the way around the band
1,This ring is very beautiful and looks very masculine on his hand. Well worth the cost! The design is like none other that I have seen and I have looked through many catalogs at men bands! I am very pleased!
0,"I bought this ring for my boyfriend. It wasn't wide enough to look masculine unless your man has small, feminime hands. I will be returning this ring."
1,the ring was great its perfect the shipping came when it was supposed too everything was perfect
1,"I must say that I absolutely love this ring. It is beautiful and very classy. Since wearing the ring, I have gotten so many compliments and everyone wanting to know where I got the ring. Of course, I tell them. I would highly recommend this ring to anyone who loves class and beauty."
1,"I not just like it - I LOVE it!!!Eventhough I got myself confused with a size and have to wear it on another finger now, I love it from the moment it apeared in my hands,MY PRECIOUS....."
1,"I don't usually take the time to leave reviews, but this is something special. Beautiful piece, awesome value, and it really looks very expensive. My first purchase of jewelry for myself in a very long time and I couldn't be more pleased!"
1,"Absoutely beautiful...I haven't had it long enough for it to get solied, but I will use a good silver polish to clean it,and I am sure it will polish like new again...It has the looks of very expensive and quality jewelry..."
0,"Its a very nice ring, though expecting something more sturdy and heavy, its nice anyway."
1,I was very impressed with the ring i bought it is beautifully made and it looks alot more expensive than it is. There is a real quality to it.
1,This is a great ring for the money it fits and fast shipping. NO problems
1,"Hey guys, Just wanted to stop by and let you know the rings are beyond great, I was very surprised with the quality or the ring !!! Interesting enough my B/F LOVED it and he is SUPER picky!!! Let me tell you my friends still think its a gold ring since the quality of silver used to make it its great and can full anyone to think its white gold... For ANYONE reading this review dont think about it twice, its a GREAT buy and for me to take the time to go online and white this it takes A LOT hehehe... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And FYI, the pic in the website does not look as good as the real thing >>>> Once you get the ring you will see what I am talking about..."
1,"This is a great ring. It is very shiny, and looks real. I get compliments on it all the time, and it will definitely do the job until we can pay off all wedding bills and purchase a real one. I am sure that I will buy one that looks very similar to this one."
1,Fantastic again!Wonderful Christmas present and it looks much more expensive than it costs - amazing value for such a nice piece.
1,"I just adore these little hoops. They are EXACTLY what I was looking for. They are hard to get in (but I knew they would be, these types of hoops are the most difficult to get in) I have 5 holes in each ear and I bought these for my new 5th hole. They are newly pierced so this is why I had difficulty. They are just perfect. I will be back to buy another pair. Simple, elegant. A++++"
1,"This style of navel ring works well for crooked piercings (where a barbell style doesn't lay straight). And it's cute, cute, cute. I love pink and know other colors are available from their website, except red, which I'd especially like to see available. The crystal heart is very sparkly and bright. This item is a WIN!"
1,My daughter loved this necklace. I thought that the 18&#34; chain would be to long but it was the perfect length.
0,I was very disappointed in the quality of the chain. Pendant is very nice. Will think again prior to buying jewelry online.
0,"Dispite paying EXTRA money for two day shipping, It is almost a week after my order and I STILL have not recieved this necklace. I also have not gotten any sort of response from the emails I have written the seller. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I'm starting to think that I paid for something that I am never actually going to have sent to me."
1,I love this necklace! it arrived a few days ago and I couldn't wait to open it. I didn't think it would looked nice when I purchased it. When I opened it I was blown away the picture doesn't explain how beautiful this necklace looks. Its Unique and not original and that is the reason why I bought it because I didn't want a necklace that has a heart or anything original. I don't regret getting this and I recommend it to anyone that wants a necklace that is unique and classic.
1,"This pendant is very shiny, dainty, and looks much more expensive than it really was. The inside of the wishbone is stamped with ""S 925 CHINA"" and the chain clasp is stamped ""925 ITALY."" I question if this is plated because on the plastic bag, the description about the bar code says ""PLTD""...which of course stands for plated. I'm not quite sure which part of this it could refer to. At any rate, it's very nice charm and chain, and looks great!"
1,"I'm very pleased with this product. I've seen it advertised elsewhere for alot more money, so when I received it today I was anxious to see what it would look like. I must admit it is fantastic, the length of the chain is just right and the wishbone itself has a very high polish. I put it on right away. If anyone out there is on the fence don't wait. It's worth every penny."
1,Very cute necklace - I got one for each of my daughters for special events that they were participating in and they both loved them.
1,love this necklace it is exactly what i was hoping for. it is very sturdy i wear it all the time!! haven't had any problems.
0,"i would not recommend this product. the wishbone is much smaller than the website picture would have you believe. in addition, the chain is very thin but i guess appropriate for the price of 16.00 dollars. still i was unimpressed of this product."
1,"I ordered this necklace with a few other bridesmaids as a surprise to our bride who wants a wishbone theme! It's beautiful, well crafted, and perfect for what we wanted. Very happy with this order and she's going to be surprised! :)"
1,Ordered this pendant as I had one when younger and lost it. Quality is very good and at a good price.
1,I saw something similar in a magazine. This is nice and delicate. It was also a great price. Perfect to wear with anything.
0,"I think I waited about 3 weeks to get this necklace, and I was excited when I received it. However, on the 2nd day of wearing it, the chain broke, so now I have to purchase a new chain for it. The pendant is too heavy for the chain, so I suggest for amazon to upgrade the chain or stop selling this item with a wimpy chain."
1,"I love the necklace. But if you are giving it as a gift, beware of the MADE IN CHINA inscribed on the inner side of it. I realize most people won't notice it while you are wearing it, but it is pretty large and noticeable. Otherwise the necklace is cute."
1,"The quality of the pendent is much much better than what the price might suggest. My friend and I both got one and agree that it can easily pass for Tiffany quality. The necklace comes in a soft navy blue pouch inside a navy blue box. There was some tangling of the chain but easily untangled. The wishbone itself is about 1/3cm thick so it doesn't look like a cheap flimsy thing, although it was a little odd that the chain was made in Italy and the pendant was made in China but that really didn't affect how great it looks."
1,"I gave this to my fiance for an Easter basket gift this year. I remembered her telling me that she loved Jennifer Aniston's necklace (which is a wishbone one, but about $6,000 more expensive than this). So I got her this one.It's very pretty, and she's gotten non-stop compliments on it. And she looks beautiful in it!"
1,"This wishbone necklace is even more beautiful than the picture.My friend recently bought one in New York and I've wanted one since I saw it. Originally, I was a little concerned about the quality of the product since the price was so low, but when I received it, I was thrilled. It's better looking than the one from New York...and for way less money!"
0,"The necklace arrived very quickly and it was just as described however the chain was heavily knotted which was a pain to undo. Otherwise, nice item."
0,"I was going to purchase this until I watched the video which reveals a ""Made in China"" stamp on the inside of one of the wishbone arms. That is pretty tacky!"
1,"I've had this necklace in my wish list for awhile and I was so happy when I received it for Christmas yesterday. It is even better in person. It's very nice quality, the chain is delicate and lovely and the medium sized wishbone feels solid. I couldn't be happier!"
1,I get compliments on this all the time. I have it for about 6 months and have had no problems.
1,"I purchased this pendant for the tweenaged daughter of friends, and it looked perfect on the web page. Very delicate and feminine. When it arrived (very quickly, I might add) I was pleased that it was as beautiful as it had looked on the computer. Our friends' daughter was very happy with it and put it on right away. It looked quite lovely on her."
0,"It looks exteremly good, I received many complemts on it. People said it looks like it worths more than $200!!!HOWEVER, it is very fragile and bents easly. Man I was really disappointed because of that. Secondly, usually if the gemstone is genuine, you get a certificate that says so, but hey.... it does'nt matter, it looks very real to me."
1,Gave it to my mom for a bday present. She loved them. Nice size. Looks really nice.
1,"These are really cute earrings, just the right size. They move very nicely on the ear and aren't prone to getting caught in your hair. They come in silver only also, but I prefer the gold."
1,Super Super Super that all I can say. I have bought many earrings for my wifes Christmas presents. These I have never seen before because of the unusual dangle seperation in the middle of the earring. Thanks for a great present.
1,I was very happy with the quality of this necklace. Everything I have purchased from Peora has been of a high quality for the price.
1,I love the color of the stone and how it hangs on my neck. It's a great necklace for the price.
1,"One of my co-workers has this ring from Tiffany's. I loved it so much, but wasn't ready to spend $250 on it. Instead, I found this ring from Eve's Addication. The ring size guide makes it easy to determine, which size to select. The ring came in a small blue velvet bag and matching box. It is .925 sterling silver, which is the same quality of Tiffany jewelry. The back is hollow so it is not solid, which does not bother me because no one ever sees it. I actually compared my ring to my co-worker's and you couldn't tell much difference! Eves Addiction also included a pair of CZ princess cut earrings since my purchase was more than $75 and I received free shipping. This is the best $32 I have spent!"
1,My husband bought this for my birthday. It is a lovely item and I like to wear it. Nice quality and lovely color.
1,"I purchased this for my daughter's 18th birthday. She loved it.Thank you, I couldn't be more pleased."
0,"Most of the stones turned black after a month or so...if you want it to simulate diamonds as I did--this is not it. I bought it as a make-shift wedding ring while pregnant and unable to wear mine, this only worked for a short time."
0,The stones turned black after a short period of time. The silver finish remained shiny but was very disappointed in the stones.
0,"I bought this ring with the intention of stacking it with a fake engagement ring found also on gem avenue. However, with a solitaire ring, it didn't really look good stacked. The ring is also a little bigger than my other size 10 rings. Anyways, I wear it as a thumb ring and it looks good there."
0,"So far so good, it was only shiney and sparkled at first. Once you start wearing it it dulls, I've been worrying about stones falling out but so far so good. It will probably happen after I push the send button."
0,"I ordered an eternity band for my wedding ring because I thought it was a great deal. However I recieved a totally different ring. I had been given an engagement ring with the double banded wedding ring and the size was not accurate. I am very disappointed. Now, I have to go find a ring before my wedding and there's no time left!"
0,"This item was definitely NOT what I thought it would be. It was not made with Swarowski crystals, it was made with plastic beads. The Sterling Silver took exactly 1 day to completely tarnish to a very rusty color. I bought it for a gift and obviously could not give it to anyone that I cared even remotely about. Very cheap looking and tacky. Will never purchase anything like this again from this company."
1,"This is beautiful crystal. I bought the set, earrings, pendant, and bracelet. I wear a 7-1/2 size bracelet, but this one is rather hard to put on by yourself with the tight toggle thing. Very nice worn with pink, blue, and/or lavender. You will receive many compliments, but get help getting the bracelet on."
1,I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas present for a friend at work. Super pretty - the colors are awesome! She loves it!
1,"Bought this for my GF. She likes to string Swarovski crystals to make sun catchers, so I thought she'd like this. She did. Her daughter was jealous, so I am buying a 2nd one for her birthday. Very happy so far."
1,"I'm not always confident in buying gift jewelry for my wife, but this bracelet (as well as several matching pieces from Gem Avenue) have been a huge hit with her. I was surprised at the quality of the bracelet, considering its reasonable price."
0,"This is a cheaply made item that doesn't work well. The box doesn't close properly as the wood is unevenly cut and placed together. Also, the figures, etc... inside are pretty poorly done. For the cheap price, you can't go wrong but I'd rather spend more and get something better quality."
0,This product was so cheap looking! It wasn't worth a dime. I am very disappointed!
0,"I know if you're buying Cubic Zirconium, you really shouldn't expect too much, but I've seen some beautiful ones, so I was hopeful with this. The CZ ""stone"" in the middle is foggy, almost. You can only tell if you're looking closely, but it's still there. Looks like a real diamond from far away.It's about the size of your pinkie fingernail - not too big, but it catches the light and sparkles everywhere.I'd definitely buy another one of these if it weren't for the foggy quality of the stone."
1,"BETTER THAN THE PIX. MY FAV EARRINGS........WELL MADE, AND I RECEIVED THEM QUICKLY....THANKS"
0,"It works like a music box--when you open it, the music sounds. But it only runs for several minutes and there seems to be a battery failure, but I cannot find the openging for battery replacement, so my daughter just use it as a ""jewelry box""."
0,"My children have had these jewelry boxes for about 2 years. The ballerina broke within the first year. I am shopping for new ones right now, and thought I would let others know in case you are considering these. They might be OK for older children - but my kids were about 4 and 2 when they received these."
0,Got this for my daughters and after a few weeks of constant winding the key would crank and then spin out quickly. I carefully dismantled the jewelery box to look into it and found that the plastic gearbox case had split wide open making it unfixable.
1,"Very delicate looking but sturdy, soft music and very feminine. Not that big, not that small. Right size for a girl that can watch it for hours play the music and the dancing ballerina :)"
1,"This was just what I was hoping for - small enough for my 4-yr-old daughter to carry around if she likes, and very pretty. The music box works as advertised and my daughter likes it, so I consider that a success."
1,I bought this for my four year old granddaughter on Amazon - it arrived in Australia in excellent condition - well packed and presented. Just such a beautiful gift for a little budding ballerina!
1,"The box was exactly as expected. It was the perfect size for my three year old granddaughter to hold. She really doesn't really put jewelry in it, but loves it for the music box, as expected. I just wish that the name of the song was on the box. Not one of us could remember the name."
1,Love this charm. I purchased two so that I could attach them to hoop earrings. Highly recommend.
1,"I purchased this product for my sister's birthday. We live 3 hours apart and I wanted something that could be delivered directly to her. Since her birthday is in August, I decided her birthstone, peridot was the way to go. After searching many sites online, I found this beautiful necklace through Amazon. It was delivered quickly to her in a pretty box and she was delighted when she opened it. I haven't seen it in person yet, but she was thrilled and told me how gorgeous it is."
0,"This necklace is very pretty, but the chain broke the first time I wore it. I don't know if the construction was cheap or if I just had a defective necklace."
1,Enjoyed this small music box very much. It was a great addition to my miniature nativity collection.
0,"The music box was nice and it works, but the nativity looks cheap. I gave these as gifts and I was embarrassed because it looked like I bought it from the Dollar Store for $5."
1,This little mini-music box has a lot of details including a central scene that rotates as the music plays. There is also a little illuminated manger (battery run) that goes off when the lid goes down.A cute miniature nativity scene and a short play version of Silent Night.
1,"This ring is so pretty. It spins easily, and the crystals sparkle as it spins. I really love it!"
1,"We recently purchased a bedroom suite and needed a short stool to use to put on shoes. Rather than travel all over town looking at furniture stores, we decided to shop on line. We are so glad we did. We used a Google image search, and found the stool and style we thought would work. Amazon had the best price so we ordered. We were very pleased that it did match the stain and style of the wood in our new bedroom suite perfectly. Each leg bolts on securely and easily. The seat cushion and wood appear to be of excellent quality. We placed it beneath a full length mirror we mounted on the wall behind it. It looks great and we look forward to years of service."
1,I bought this stool to match my existing vanity and it's the perfect match... the wood is very rich looking. The seat fabric is more of a gold color rather than a tan. Very well made and was easy to assemble! Fast ship!
1,"The gold ankle bracelet is gorgeous.It is quite delicate and, in fact, so beautiful, I've had it shortened to wear as a bracelet on my wrist. It's gorgeous."
0,Ankle bracelett broke after one week of wear due to a weak link. Was not the quality I was expecting
1,The anklet was apparently delivered but I did not recive it. Amazon was great in trying to replace it but it was unavailable. I did receive full credit and am more than happy with the way they handle the transaction. Now just off to search for a different anklet.
1,"Beautiful item, but cannot attest to its' durability as I have just given it as a gift."
0,"The anklet is pretty, has a nice thickness, and it fits well. And it seems like it's generally of good quality. However, the item I received was kinked in two places when I removed it from the box. I may have simply received a damaged item, but beware that this may happen to you as well."
0,"Very nice peridot necklace. I bought the 3-piece set for a birthday gift, and I was proud to give it as a gift."
1,"As always, shopping with Amazon was a pleasureable experience. The item mentioned was a birthday present. It arrived very, very, fast and turned out to be an extremely nice gift. I would also like to point out that I am very pleased that Amazon offers free shipping when you purchase items over a certain dollar amount. It certainly makes you wonder why others are such ""rip-off"" artists when it comes to shipping and handling charges. This is not my 1st purchase through Amazon and it will definitely not be my last. Great deals on quality products, fast and free shipping. What more can you ask for?!!!"
1,I haven't ever done reviews..but I bought this for my wife on our 11th wedding anniversary and she loves it!
1,"It's really pretty and still durable enough to wear every day. In fact, I never take mine off, and have never had problems with it. The texture is interesting and captures attention."
1,"I purchased this for my daughter's 45th birthday, and she loved it, and wouldn't take it off."
1,"I was hesitant to order this chain sight unseen, but as it turns out I made the right decision. It is exactly what I was looking for. This is a high quality chain and just the perfect weight for the Celtic cross my husband bought me for Christmas last year. The lobster claw clasp is much more attractive and classier looking than an o-ring style clasp. I am very happy with this purchase."
0,"It's plastic, but does the trick. The biggest problem the plastic chain is way to short. I can barley get it around my neck. I would try something with a longer chain."
0,I'm still waiting to receive the item which was ordered over a month ago.
1,This is exactly what I expected. I'm very pleased. Thank you.
1,"I am VERY happy with this necklace, it's beautiful! I received it within 3 days of my order. I'm sure I will get a lot of compliments."
1,Very nice chain...it will look great with a diamond solitaire pendant or just worn alone. I'm impressed with the quality. Thanks!
1,I needed a medium length chain to use with several different silver pendants. This chain is attractive and strong and has worked out perfectly.
0,I needed to return this item after I bought it. It is not a finely polished piece of jewelry (you can feel that it is rough when you run your hand over it). It kept snagging the hair of the person I had given it to. It could be a potential problem for anyone with long hair.
1,"I was very pleased with my purchase, and would purchase from this seller again"
1,"It's perfect! Very nice weight, not at all tiny. A fraction of the price that all the ""major"" jewelry stores were asking for the same weight, style and length. Perfect for the diamond pendant I got for Christmas, it adds to the beauty of the pendant instead of taking away from it. Don't be afraid to buy this it's worth every penny!"
1,"I read reviews before purchasing this gold chain and am another satisfied customer. I have not had problems with green marks left on the neck; this necklace is perfect. I plan to buy another of the same style, but a larger diameter."
1,I love this necklace!! Bought it as a gift and it is prettier in person than online!!
0,"The chain came broken but besides that, it doesn't look good and it is inflexible so it's hard to wear any charm on it. Thanks to Amazon they had no problem refunding my money, very happy with Amazon service."
1,"I bought three of these for three granddaughters. I think they'll like it, especially with the charm I bought for them.I am very pleased."
1,This necklace is just perfect and I love wearing it.
1,"No complaints about the quality. What I like best is that the wheat link has a rich gold color that is not too shiny, whereas something like a box link is much shinier."
1,A beautifully crafted piece of wheat gold and a very good value.
0,I agree with the first review. Looks like kid's jewelry. Don't waste your money.
1,I got these for my wife as a Valentines gift and they are beautiful. I see no blemishes and it sparkles. 1/2 cttw was a good size as her first set of diamond earings. Fast shipping and bought them during the 40% off sale. We are both completely happy with the purchase.
0,Over all a good purchase. I got these for my wife she likes them. When I seen them I was not very impress with the looks they are bigger then I thought they would from looking at the image. But that's the chance you take when ordering item online. Next time I will just find items that has a few customer reviews.
1,I purchased this and received it the next day! I couldn't believe it. I had just been to my local jeweler who showed me a similar necklace at almost twice the price. And the length was a special order so it would have taken 2 weeks! I am so pleased with this purchase.
1,My wife loves the chain. The chain total weight was more than we could get locally. It is very finely done with a secure clasp and the cost over over $100 less than anything we saw. The value is really unbelievable. Thank you!!!
0,The earrings are very pretty. My only negative comment is that the backings that hold on the earrings are entirely too small. We will have to replace them with larger backings. It is ashame to buy a product; then to have to go back to a jewlery store to to replace parts that are inferior.
1,"The necklace is of excellent quality, weight &amp; impressively packaged for the price offered. I purchased a very similar item at Zales for nearly 3x the price offered here (which I no doubt returned). I liked it so much that I also ordered a yellow gold one."
1,The 14kyg necklace is just gorgeous. I bought it for my husband and he loves it. It looks really nice on him and he said it's very comfortable on. The price was terrific also. Thanks
1,I am very pleased with this chain. Amazon's description is completely accurate. The gold chain is very well made and durable. The gold chain has a good mass (it is NOT thin or flimsy) and the chain reflects light well. I highly recommend it if you seeking a quality Italian gold chain in this size.
1,"Excellent piece of jewelry, and weighed in at 15.7 grams, greater weight than advertised. I have a 3.5 gram cross on it, and it's perfect. Nice weight and color is a true 14K yellow gold. It matches my other solid 14k gold pieces."
0,This necklace was not Italian as indicated. It did not come in a wooden gift box. It was lighter in weight than listed. It did not have a smooth and polished surface. It was generally poor quality. I returned it immediately but have yet to receive my refund two weeks later.
1,"I just received this Curb Link bracelet and I love it. The cost was phenomenal, the shipping was fast, and the packing was very articulate. Thanks for helping me with my Christmas Shopping."
0,"I don't actually know how well these are going to hold up. They were a gift. However, when I got them1) they just came in a bag. No earrings backing, which I found strange.2) The color is more green than the picture. I was expecting a nice, calm blue. No. More of a bright blue with specks of green and yellow.However, they were very pretty nonetheless. Just realize the picture wasn't exactly what we got."
1,This tag is just as it looks and heavy metal - not lightweight aluminum. Bright colors. Really like this tag.
0,These earrings are way bigger than you would think they are. I don't see how they expect ANYONE to wear these!
1,"I am so pleased with these earrings! I started shopping around for other sterling silver earrings in the brick and mortar stores after I placed this order because I was getting a little nervous about whether they'd arrive on time (I needed to have them by 12/22). There is just nothing out there that compares with these! The cost was reasonable; the silver is actually sterling silver, and the quality and workmanship is great, very lustrous, no rough edges or thin areas. The size is neither too large nor small, and the design is very unusual; nothing I had seen in the stores comes close in uniqueness. I only wish I had purchased another 2 pairs to give as another Christmas gift and one for myself. Don't hesitate in buying these if you think you or someone you know might like them!"
1,"I ordered these earrings on a Sunday, and by Wednesday it was in my hands. I like the black velvet bag it comes inside, and the earrings themselves were in great shape. Not quite as round as they looked (more a vertical oval) but just as pretty as I thought they'd be. Next time, they're going to me mine, not just a gift for someone else."
1,"The dangles are just the right size and length. They are light to wear, but have enough weight that they stay in place. They go with just about any kind of clothing-from jeans to dresses."
1,I was pleased how quickly the earrings arrived and with the quality of the earrings.
1,I was definitely happy with the 1/10 ct Diamond Anniversary band. It was a great compliment for the Engagement ring I got for my Wife. It has milgrained edges that matched perfectly beside her 18k white gold 1.2 ct Tiffany Legacy style ring and it was for $500 less than the band that was supposed to match it! Very happy
1,"We bought this as a baptism gift for an 18-month-old. It came quickly, was packaged nicely, and was absolutely beautiful. The bracelet fit her perfectly."
1,Really like these earrings! Fourth time I have ordered from Silver Insanity and I have never been disappointed! Plan to order 2 more pair to give as Halloween surprises to friends. Could even get away with wearing these when it is not Halloween season
1,"The earrings are beautiful! I paid a fair price, and the product arrived before I expected it to. I will be using this vendor again!"
0,"The charm is a huge disappointment. It looks like it is from a gumball machine. And even worse, the clasp does NOT even connect so that you can put a chain on it. It is really chinsy!! I hope the refund is as simple as the purchase!"
1,"This is beautiful, much nicer than in the picture. It's very light and the cord is pretty comfortable. It's also excellent value, and there was free shipping, too. I am very happy with this necklace."
1,I bought these earrings as a gift. The person I bought them for loved them and wears them often. The quality was very good and they looked better in person then the picture reflected.
0,Ring looks like crap. I'm sure if items smelled this would smell like crap as well. Horribly put together. Can see weldings. Looks like the black middle is cheap paint poorly applied. Just all around bad bad ring.
0,"I ordered a Chefmaster 8 pc BBQ set in case from Amazon.com vendor (Dashlynn.com). I knew what I wanted to give my father for Christmas and after searching the internet I found many different vendors offering the BBQ set I wanted. Once I found it on Amazon.com, I decided to order it because I have had such great service from your company. Everything is as promised and on time and with this being a Christmas gift...I needed it on time. So, I place my order on Dec. 11th and the item was listed as &quot;in stock&quot; and my estimate delivery was Dec 18-24. I knew this would be close, but with the product in stock, would be no problem. After a week of not hearing anything about my order shipping, I tried to call Dashlynn three times only to be told they would research it and call me back later -- and never calling back! I also sent two email notes to customer service. Finally, after three days of trying I got an email reply for Dashlynn.com stating that the item was out of stock and therefore I would not be getting it! Now I am really in a bind. I have no time to order the item from another vender this close to Christmas. This has been a HUGE dissapointment! I would have appreciated Dashlynn to notify me immediately after I placed my order of the order status and not a week and a half later, at my request! Also, I wish Amazon.com would not have this type of company listed under your umbrella. I trusted them because I trust you and they obviously do not live up to your customer service standards. I would like this passed on to them as well. I am not stuck with a few days to try and find something else for a gift. GET RID OF DASHLYNN!!!"
1,"These cufflinks were beautiful! They complimented my husband's tux very well, and they were very easy to use. They were a nice weight also."
1,"The item looks beautiful as it showed in the picture. The size is a little bit big. I just hope it would be a little bit smaller The quality is good. Overall, it worth the money you pay."
1,"I could not believe the quality of this bracelet for the price. It has four nice size garnets, linked with delicate but strong Celtic knot work. It's not too small either. I hate bracelets that are hard to fastening because there is play in them. The quality is such you would expect to pay twice there easily for this wonderful bracelet. I have already given on away as a thank you present."
1,"This is the first time I ever recieved a next day order, the next day!!!Great Job!"
0,"I bought the ring because I had seen pictures in magazines that the bar will flip over and follow the curve of your belly as you grow. I started wearing it at month 6. It never flipped and I ended up taking it out in month 8. However, it was a little bit helpful in that the gauge was smaller so I could stretch a little more and didn't end up losing the hole. Now I'm back to my regular rings and they're fine. For 7 bucks, you might as well but it's nothing glamorous."
1,This necklace is simply beautiful and is elegant. I received one as a new year present and I'm very impressed with the very high quality of this product. The shell itself is extremely pretty and looks very expensive. The dots on the top look extremely classic and is a great addition to the pendant. The only complaint that I have is the chain. The rope chain doesn't really go with the pendant but overall
1,This pendant is even lovelier than it looks in the picture. I wore it at a wedding and I received plenty of compliments. I am definitely happy I bought it--and at a great price.
1,"This is a gorgeous necklace! The simple styling make it appropriate for both casual and dressy attire. You can adjust the length of the necklace with the excess chain. Take a look at the matching earrings, it's a great set."
1,"I got this bracelet as a Christmas gift. It is absolutely gorgeous in person, the picture online does not do it justice. It's very eye-catching but not gaudy. I've gotten several compliments on it just since Christmas. My one complaint is that due to the size and shape of the stones, and how close they are to the clasp, it's a little difficult for me to actually put it on myself - I always need someone to clasp it for me. But that's really a minor thing and I'm sure if I worked at it, I could do it myself eventually."
1,These are beautiful earrings. I am very happy with them they look as good in reality as they do in the picture. I had originally bought them as a gift but didn't arrive in time for Christmas so I kept them for myself. I am happy I did because I was complimented on them the first time I wore them.
1,"Just what we've been looking for - a graduation gift that's both trendy and affordable.Most of us know that anything on a leather cord is considered &quot;in&quot; by sweet young things. So to find this onyx and pearl pendant on said cord was a happy surprise.A pearl is, of course, a classic fashion statement, and the addition of the leather cord makes it state of the art.Plus, the price is right! We think the grads we know and love will be delighted!"
1,"This necklace was above my expectation. You will not go wrong if you purchase it, it is just simply gorgeous."
1,It's a beautiful necklace and there are matching ear rings that can be bought to go with it. The company delivered in a rapid response also. Highly recommended.
0,"I purchased this item thinking that it would be similar to the picture on the site. I was a little disappointed in that the bracelet links are larger then they actually appear in the photo. The bracelet is still very nice looking but, again, larger than I had assumed it would be.The clasp is very hard to fasten and unfasten. Once the bracelet is fastened it stays fastened, literally. My problem is that when I put it on I have a HARD time getting it off. I'm sure that with some wearing the clasp will get easier. I just hope, after reading another review, that it will not get so easy that I end up losing it."
1,This necklace is just beautiful. I also bought the bracelet and matching earrings. The pendant on this bracelet is much larger and heavier in person than it looks in the picture. Very very nice quality silver and onyx. Looks like you would pay much more for a piece this size.
1,"Trusted Amazon and felt they would sell only the best for me at a great price...right ? They hit the ball out of the park!These earrings are hefty weight without being &quot;heavy&quot;. Stones have gorgeous coloring, and the cut must be incredible because they sparkle sparkle sparkle.At the price...I am ordering a few more pairs for my family...and that order will be free shipping so how fabulous is that !?"
0,"Unlike the matching bracelet I previously ordered from Amazon.com, this necklace was acceptable in that the Mother-of-Pearl inlay did not have a gross defect in its surface. Value for the dollar spent, but no bargain by any means."
1,The quality and workmanship on these earrings is quite good. I've received numerous complements on these -- a really good buy!
0,"You have got to be one of the most difficult websites to navigate, and the most difficult to find how to contact a person with which to discuss a problem ordering!"
0,the earrings were cheaply made and were not the same size. One was smaller than the other...the earrings were returned.....
0,"These ear rings were going to be for my prom, i wanted them so bad as they were perfect for my dress, i could not afford it as i spent so much on other things, well my rush delivery it came out to be 23 dollars, my little sister with her babysitting money offered these as my graduation present! imagine her dissapoint when all her late hours taking care of screaming babies were for a rip off!! the earrings are about as tiny as my pinky nail! so sad they wouldve been the perfect gift :/ i tried contacting this seller and NO ANSWER!! when ups delivered it, the seal was already broken and the driver didnt even bother to knock our door he threw it on our door step and ran, no time to get to him..this was my first online purchase i have learned my lesson.."
1,"I used this bracelet to put together a charm bracelet using the lobster claw charms from SheBeads. It worked out nicely. The links are chunky enough to make a nice stand alone bracelet, but small enough to work great with charms."
0,"I was looking for a good looking jewelry roll to take with me to jewelry shows and the picture of this one looked pretty good. When I received it, I was very disappointed. It's cheap looking and the space where you insert ID is not even big enough for a standard business card. I really don't think this is worth $20, maybe $10. I'm thinking I could find something at the flea market for less money and have it be better looking. It might work for personal use for trips but if you want to look professional, look elsewhere."
0,Looks better online. I bought 3. And the despcription seemed like it was nice and really good quality. But it wasn't at all. It was cheap and the material thin.
1,The package arrived 2 days early.There is a little cute black gift box which looks great and the necklace is perfect.Totally satisfied.
1,"I recieved this Ammonite pendant from my husband as a gift for Christmas. It really is very beautiful. It is very well made, the silver is very good quality. I placed it on a black leather cord and I wear it as a choker. I absolutely love it, it is worth every penny."
1,"This necklace is beautiful. I bought this for someone to wear with a gold dress knowing that they only wear silver. The stone is a bit less ""yellowy"" than the photo would suggest. Looked great next to gold fabric."
0,"The silver bracelet offered a very pretty setting, but I was so disappointed in the quality of the scarabs. Typically, scarabs have a nice sheen, but these were dull and lackluster. Silver Speck refunded my money."
1,"I purchased this sterling silver charm to replace one that was identical to it (that I'd had for almost 20 years) and lost somehow this past spring. Something Silver's customer service was wonderful. After a mishap with the US postal service that returned my package back to Something Silver, they were nice enough to send it again and covered the cost of that shipping. The packaging was very cute as well!The charm is slightly smaller than my original, but I'm so happy to have it!"
1,Unique for a unique child. My son did research on this type of jewerly and I was glad to give it to him as a gift.
1,I purchased this ring to replace an aquamarine one I'd had for over 40 years. The color is brillant and quality very good. It is comfortable and I can highly recommend it!
1,Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this ring for the money. Stone is large and a beautiful shade of blue. Ring itself is good weight. A lot of ring for the money
1,"For this price, my expectations were low, but I was pleasantly surprised! The stone is large, and its dimensions make the pale blue sparkle from the sides. The band is substantial but runs just a tad big. I actually bought this for ""Santa"" to give to me (Mom) along with presents for my daughter, and was frustrated that I couldn't wear it until I opened presents on Christmas day :)"
1,looks great. good deal for the size of stone and for real .925 silver. Yes it has a hallmark on it. looks almost as blue as photo. But if it was darker you would be paying more.update...................................................................I wish I could take off 3 stars the stone came out of my ring after the review. I also don't have the paper work to try and take it back or fix it.
1,"I like the ring, it's big, shiny and inexpensive (I paid $25). The band is silver and is good quality. The stone is pretty eye catching and I've gotten lots of compliments."
1,"Excellent cut,high grade stone,nice setting.My mother loves it.I would highly reccomend buying one.topaz is a beautiful stone and these are nice ones."
0,"Not happy with this ring. Looks nothing like the picture. The stone looks fake and the band is thin, very lightweight, just flimsy!Would send back but my husband opened it and threw all packing away."
1,The ring arived on time and was packaged well. The ring itself is exactly what I was expecting and at a great price.
1,Sterling Silver Oval Blue Topaz RingI have received many compliments about this ring. I love it!
1,"I do not buy many gemstones and was nervous as I waited for this ring to arrive in the mail. But I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the box! It is gorgeous! It comes in a very nice silver setting and the stone is absolutely beautiful. I can not say enough how pleased I am with this ring. If you are tempted to purchase it, you won't regret it - it is WELL worth the money!"
1,Love this ring. Nice size and beautiful color. Great setting strong enough for everyday wear. I wear my rings when I do everything even house work. I would highly recommend this ring!
1,"I bought these for my 5 yr. old daughter to wear when cheering, since their mascot is a Pirate. They were the perfect size for her tiny ears! She adored them so much she wouldn't take them out. Unfortunately she lost one at school so I am now having to purchase a second pair to replace them. We both loved them so much it is absolutely worth purchasing twice!"
1,I really am impressed with the quality of theses products. I bought three different sets of skull earrings. All great !!!!!!!! Exactly as described in literature on product. Very nice to do business with.
0,When I recieved this item it had split apart and was broken. I was so mad I just threw it away!!!
0,"I received this as a gift. The stones are a lovely smoky quartz color, not a faded out version. The necklace looks very pretty. The problem, however, is that the loop that the necklace threads through on the pendant is like an oversized 'D'......with the flat part against the pendant, and the rounded part against your skin. It's so oversized that it means the pendant cannot lay flat, but instead will only stay on it's side. This renders the pendant useless, since no one buys their jewelry for the profile! I will have to send this back, unfortunately. A shame, since I got the matching earrings, and they are adorable!"
1,"I bought this necklace for myself and love it! From the picture, it looks like it might be too big. But it's the perfect size and a great necklace to wear casually or with something nicer too."
0,"This ended up larger than I was hoping for and still haven't even bothered to wear them. Plus the look of them are not too appealing, imagine if they were stamped straight from a flat sheet of metal. The picture makes it look like they have some roundness or curve to them, but mine certainly did not."
1,"What a great value. Would not hesitate to buy again. One area of improvement would be that the clasp is a little small and difficult. By the way this is not really a ""kid's review"" but I just didn't want to give out my info which the kid's review allows you to do"
1,"This bracelet is very pretty and it is definitely worth the price. I was very happy when I opened it and saw how nice actually is...the ""tanzanite"" stones are a great purplish/blue color, the clasp is nice and the bracelet is a good weight-not flimsy. Love it!"
1,"I was a little nervous ordering jewelry over the Internet, but then again I hate going into a jewelry store too. I tend to be very much of a comparison shopper, but jewelry makes it hard to do that, there are too many choices, settings, etc. Amazon is starting to fix that, now I can go online and at least feel somewhat comfortable that I priced around.I'm happy with the quality, size, setting, etc with these earrings. It goes well with the pearl necklace I got for my wife a couple of years ago. My wife is happy, so I'm happy..."
1,"My wife ,as well as myself, were extremely happy and satisfied with the Akoya Cultured Pearl. It was delivered on time and it helped to enhance a wonderfull Christmas.Thank you."
1,"This was my first experience ordering jewelry on the Internet. After pricing similar necklaces in jewelry stores, I was delighted with both the beauty and the price of this pearl pendant. The pearl is lustrous!"
1,The earrings were better than expected. The pearls were large and the diamonds were a great touch. My wife loved them and enjoys showing them off. Service was great and delivery very prompt. Would do business again.
0,"I thought the pearl was a very good size and quality for the price. I was very happy with this purchase, though I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the gold chain. I think it's much too thin for such a large pendant and I'm worried it's going to break very easily."
1,"The pearl is a very nice size and has pretty good luster. I can see my face in it. The chain, while thin and dainty, goes well with it; just don't wear it to bed or put it in a pile with other necklaces! It'll definitely get tangled up."
1,ery suitable for wearing for fashionable occasions. very dressy
0,"The pearls I received were yellowish in hue - not bright white. The luster was rather dull - yes, evenly matched dull. However, the set pictured are almost pink in color with a brilliant luster.I will just wear them for everyday.For $15, this was a 'you get what you pay for' set of earrings, not worth returning. If I'd paid more, I'd return them. B or C quality."
1,"These are very nice looking earrings at a great price, especially since I got them at 50% off. Great as a gift."
0,"The pearls themselves seem to be of decent quality but the strand seems too short, its like a choker and the pearls do not lay straight. Worth the $35 but not a huge bargain for a higher quality piece."
0,"This necklace seems to have two personalities. Reviewers on one hand showered praise on it, and on the other disparaged it. Well, I gave it a try, and, sorry to say, I did not like it. Perhaps the quality of the newer ones are not up to par, because it seems the older reviews are better. In my case, I agree with one of the recent reviewer that the necklace is too tight that is why it does not straighten up. Also, a majority of the pearls are too small closer to the 3.0 size than the 7.5mm size. However, the pearls themselves seem to have a nicer quality. I returned mine."
1,"I have a dear friend that has always loved my akoya graduated pearl strand, but as dear as my friend is, I could not afford the akoya version of the graduated pearls for her. So, I looked at costume jewelry for the graduated look, and found that Monet has a fake version for about $60 retail, and I came down to choosing between these and the Monet version. After reading some of the other reviews, I was hesitant to purchase these pearls. (As one reviewer put it, these pearls seem to have a split personality.) I felt that for the price of these compared to the price of the Monet fake version, I should at least try these pearls and return them if I am not satisfied. I must say that I was VERY surprised at how beautiful these pearls were once I got them. I compared them to the akoya version that I have, and they held their own! To the reviewer that said that it had too many small pearls, all I can tell you is that this strand matched my akoya strand pearl size for pearl size the whole length of the necklace. I also went back and compared them to the fake strand and they made the fake strand look even more visibly fake. These pearls hung beautifully, and had a wonderful sheen to them. They came in a black velvet pouch which was similiar to the one that my akoyas are stored in. But the real test came when I gave them to my friend, and she thought that I spent a fortune on them because they were a real pearl strand and not fake strand. For the price that I spent on them, I am now kicking myself for not purchasing a set for me, my daughter, my mom, my sister-in-law, my neice, all my other girlfriends, and...well you get the point! But I feel that they are well worth the price asked of them."
0,"The pearls were a bit dull, a little uneven in size but nice for the price."
1,I bought these earings for my wedding day and they are beautiful. Great price and free shipping.
1,"These pearls aren't flashy or glamorous (I was looking for something not too big and gaudy), but they're great for everyday wear and look very nice with both business and casual attire. Great color, luster, and the perfect size. There were few (if any) imperfections in the pearls, the backs are white gold and look very secure, They came in very nice packaging, and the free shipping was very timely."
0,"The pearls came off the post after two months of use. I would like my money back. I also purchased at the same time, a pair of gold earrings, those also came off their post four weeks after purchase! I would like my money back for those as well."
0,"I bought these as my wifes push gift about 10 month ago, and the pearl came off today. no warranty, since Amazon only offers a 30 day warranty.they were nice, but buyer beware. It seems like they don't last."
1,"I purchased this simple necklace to wear in my wedding, and it was a great purchase.It is small, and the chain is quite delicate, but it is lovely and certainly worth the price."
0,"The quality of the pearls looked fine. However, the stringing was not good and the pearls would not lay flat."
1,They are cute and the quality worths the money. A good gift at a reasonable price.
1,I bought these for my wife and she has been wearing them almost everyday for two years. They still look great and are very strong.
1,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! IT WILL MAKE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS PRESENT OR MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT FOR THE ONE YOU LOVE.
1,"Packaged beautifuly. I'm glad their were choices of chain length. It looks just like the picture. The 17 year old that I gave it to, loves it."
1,The manatee is great quality and was really liked by my husband on his birthday. Nice qauality and something I would buy again from this dealer. It was a bit smaller than I originally thought but still worth getting.
1,"This is the second thing I've ordered from PalmBeach Jewelry and it's very nice for the price! It's gold plated so it doesn't turn my finger green and it comes in larger sizes (10 for me) so I can wear it on my thumb, forefinger or middle finger instead of a &#34;ring&#34; finger. Also, in each of my PalmBeach packages I have received a free gift! In this package it was a woven bracelet which my daughter really liked. Okay, so it doesn't look completely authentic, it does look really good for a $22 ring! I will definitely purchase from them again! Also, this purchase was an Amazon Prime purchase and they guarantee free returns in case it doesn't fit. Can't really lose with this one!!"
1,Love the style and size of the ring. The ring is not heavy when wearing it.Would recommend this ring.
1,It's a nicely made ring. I bought it to wear on my middle finger. I've had many compliments on this ring. I did put a coat of clear nail polish on it to protect the gold plating.
1,"Nice, inexpensive finish to handmade earrings. Great for hanging displays at street faires. Seller is prompt and reliable."
0,"The ring felt a little thinner than expected, but aside from that it's a nice looking ring. The problem is that it fit much smaller than the size listed. I am able to wear it but not on the finger I wanted because it's too small."
1,"This is a beautiful piece of jewlery, especially as it is so inexpensive. I was pleasantly surprised to receive such a nice piece for so little money. I was looking for a pink pendant, and this really fits the bil."
0,"I recieved this as a gift for my birthday, and when I opened it, I was terribly dissapointed. The earrings have two different prongs. One earring has all three prongs pictured (one of which looks like 'v', as shown), and the other has a different prong at the point of the earring. They are unwearable! The vendor has very poor quality control"
0,The charm is very flat and not as nice as presented in the photo on amazon.
1,"I just received this pendant in the mail and other than having to untangle the chain when I first opened it, it's perfect. The heart without the bale is about the size of a penny which is just perfect for me since I like dainty jewelry. The rubies and diamonds are pretty and the silver is highly polished with rhodium plating. The chain it came with is also comfortable and all in all, it is a lightweight, comfortable, beautiful necklace and it looks just like it does in the picture online. I am pleased :)"
1,"My daughter requested ""exquisite silver jewelry"" for her 16th birthday. We got her this necklace and she loves it. She is not really a ""girly-girl"", but she wears this necklace every day. It is much prettier ""in person"" even than in the picture."
1,I love sterling silver and decided to take a chance in ordering this ring. And I'm glad I did. I absolutely love it. It is just perfect. I've received compliments from friends and strangers alike.Suggestion
1,These are very close if not the exact same shade as real Tanzanite. Considering what the cost of a pair of real Tanzanite earrings would be in this size - well I'm extremely happy to have these as a substitute! I may even order a second pair as a back up because they are that pretty. Highly recommend.
1,Nice colored stones and it complimented the braclet well. My friend loved it. She likes anything purple and the stones are her birthstones.
1,"I just wore this pair the other day, everyone that saw them loved them. The color is so delicate; and, looks like real amethyst. I certainly will be buying more of these earrings. The price is definitely right, and they look good, too!"
1,Received these as a gift. Love them. They are my birthstone and go with many outfits. Great buy and super cute.
1,"Stocking stuffer for my teen age daughter who likes purple -- just as pictured--good color;consistent throughout - a little sparkle from the polished chips -- any bigger and I think they would be too big -- as to breaking, I won't know unitl after Xmas -- got the bracelet also and a very good match--$2.00"
1,"Exactly what I wanted. Fast shipping, good packaging.This was a gift, and so far we have had no issues.Great purple color, she loves them"
1,"They were a Valentines Day Gift. I ordered them late, but they arrived on time. My wife had new holes put in her ears last weekend just for the new studs. Although, they are small diamonds, their brilliance makes them look much bigger."
0,I got the earrings today and they don't look at all like in the picture in fact they look cheaper than what I paid for so disappointed
0,"Very pretty , but quite flat and look more like leaves than hearts! Very shiny - think I will enjoy them!"
0,"I do like these earrings. The only thing I warn about is they are not like the picture. They are not two toned, and they are quite thin. However, catches the light and pretty - just not well depicted in the picture."
1,This pendant is beautiful and an excellent value for the price. I am very pleased with it and get quite a few compliments when I wear it.
0,"If you like this design, then go for it, because Peora has good quality pieces. However, after seeing this in person, I can tell you that the setting is too big and overpowering for the size of this gemstone, so it ends up looking a little weird. It might look better with a stone that has more brilliance than citrine (perhaps blue topaz?), but either way I'd look for a different setting."
1,"I was so anxious to get these and they arrived today. I could not be happier with them! Perfect size, not too large, not too small, the color is amazing! LOVE them!"
1,I wear this bracelet quite frequently. It's not too heavy and I find it very attractive. Nice quality also.
0,"This product was just average due to it's shipping and instructions. This machine is supposed to come with different cleaners and polishing cloth. However, they are not shipped together and I had to call back to get the cleaners. The machine is worthless with out them. It took nearly 3 weeks to get all materials necessary to use this product. Additionally, the instructions are vague and don't give good direction on how to clean all types of jewelery."
1,"The ring is beautiful, delicate & truly looks vintage. Sizing is true.The filigree is amazing - in total it stands out amongst modern jewellery as something unique and special from a distant era - when people took the time to concern themselves with the finest of details.I'll be wearing a work of art!"
0,"Stones don't look like sapphire, the setting is dull, even for antiqued. So small that the darkness is detrimental to the whole ring. I was very disappointed."
0,"Really dislike the way these earrings look and sit in the ear. No way I would have purchased if seen in person. But I can't fault the listing or seller, it's my own fault."
1,"I love this necklace. It is very pretty, and I love that you can buy the length of chain you need--very smart selling point!"
1,I've looked at a lot of eternity pendant necklaces but this is the first one I've found on a snake chain. Very pretty. Very nice. Good quality
1,This is a beautiful sterling charm that will be a nice gift for a friend. I like that it's simple and looks good for a twenty-something gal.
0,"I wanted some drop style turquoise earrings, but did not want to pay the price most of them demand. These are nice, but did not break the bank."
1,It's a cute tongue ring and the balls hardly ever come unscrewed when they're not suppose to. Yup.
1,"I had recently ordered and received a crescent pendant from a TV shopping channel. It was real gem stones and triple the cost, but was simply not worthit it in either the look or the quality of the piece. This one definitely is. The pendant appears to be well made, the stones are properly set and the chain has an extender, which a lot of people like. It's a lovely piece for any one who's a ""moon girl"" or just wants a believable CZ piece for day or evening."
1,these are very nice earrings. they shipped fast and came with free shipping and a coupon. nice packaging.
1,"The silver is polished perfectly, and the blue topaz sparkles. These are beautiful earrings my wife and daughter love them."
0,bracelet looks like what is shown but it is 7 INCHES in length absolutely NOT 9 INCHES stated in description. lost return info and guess will have to give it to someone else since it is two inches off. Very DISAPPOINTED.
0,Came un-hooked very easy. This item was longer than normal and I was unable to wear it.
0,The stones were smaller than appeared in the picture of them. Otherwise they are very nice.
1,Needed earrings to match a necklace with the same stones; this fit the bill perfectly. Good quality silver and gemstones.
0,"I received this ""locket"" in the mail yesterday. It is teeny-tiny and gold filled. I believe I paid $55.00 + shipping for a piece of cheesy costume jewelry, that used to be available in a Five & Ten store. I was hoping this gift would become an heirloom that she could pass down to her own little girl. I am afraid it is a piece of junk. It would behoove the vender to say in the ad that it is gold filled. The locket is so miniscule that I can't imagine any photo or piece of a photo fitting in it. Quel dommage!!!"
0,"This ring I ordered because I loved their Jessica Simpson replica, however it is uncomparable. The main diamond is on the large size however, the diamonds all around the wedding band and engagement ring are so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see them. Additionally, the wedding band width is SO THIN, it is obvious that it is not real. The silver is also too shiny making it look cheap. I did not return the item, good enough for wearing around the kids. I would NOT go out of the house with this one... not worth it in my opinion. I was very disappointed."
1,I just received my order today and the rings are awesome! They are a good weight not cheap and flimsy like I feared they'd be. They sparkle like crazy and dare I say they look like the real deal? ;) I am very impressed and I can't wait to wear them. Thanks Amazon. :)
1,This is worth at least twice what it costs and is very believable size and the round stones are faceted (cut) exactly with the right amount of facets and NO WAY would ANYONE guess they were not real! NO WAY! Very comfy too. Doesn't irritate finger. Came in 2 days I think...I am ECSTATIC!
0,"They were definitely beautiful as previous reviews stated. The problem is that I must have odd fingers as they were so big they made my middle and pinky fingers stick way out to the side. It was far from comfortable and would have looked awkward to someone else's eyes. I am sending them back. Other than the too-bulky-for-me problem, the 2 day shipping was fast. The rings do not look cheap at all, but be prepared (in case you are like me) to have the prongs poking you. I even tried just one or two of the rings and it did not look right."
1,"I bought this set of three planning to use two to flank a blue eternity band I already had. The size is about half a carat for each ring, with a very nice sparkle and shine. This is very realistic looking and they look great toghether. Because the stones are not too large, they fit quite comfortably. Highly recommended!"
1,I love the look of this ring. I've worn the rings for two weeks straight now. They don't grap on my clothes and I've even worn them in the shower with them coming out looking perfect.The sizing was correct.
1,"These rings are perfect! I bought these because I lost a stone from my wedding band and I wanted to replace it, so now I have one to replace it and one to wear as an anniversary band and another as a back up! Ther fit true to size and are wonderful. Good buy :)"
1,"After an extensive search, I found these to be the best price. When I received them, I was very pleased. They are true to size, and, despite having stones all the way around, they are comfortable. The center band is very slightly wider than the other two, which gives the set interest. However, I was basically looking for two little bands to stack before and after a white gold and mixed gemstone ring I received as a birthday present and these are *perfect*."
1,"Wanted something simple and sparkly and perhaps to layer with other jewelry. These were fairly inexpensive but don""t look it! Have worn a few times now and love them although I will say that they seem to be slightly on the tight side, VERY SLIGHTLY. Maybe its just the warm summer months though...."
1,"These are so beautiful. I got these for summer, hands swell and I cant wear my normal rings, and for traveling...so I dont have to worry so much. These have gotten me so many compliments and they are still shiny."
1,"I got these rings for a replacement wedding band at work, as well as an anniversary band.They are extemely versatile, and I love the way they work with other rings I have, individually, and together. They are an exceptional value, as well. I plan on letting them sit out exposed to air so they tarnish just a little and better match my white gold wedding set. The stones are very sparkly and real looking, not so big as to look ridiculous on me. Love love love them! I feel like they will be favorites forever."
1,"Very pretty ring set!!!! I bought them so I can stack them along with my engagement ring and they look so beautiful together!! I'm a fan of sparkly things but I don't have any diamonds, so these are the perfect complement for the ring I had already. I will post a picture so you can see how pretty they look. Shipment was FAST."
1,"Great sparkle, accurate sizing. Perfect amount of bling! I would love to have a set for my pinkie as well."
1,This is such a beautiful ring!!!! I can't wait to wear it. It's the perfect touch for an evening out.
1,"Getting married in a few weeks, using these rings as a substitute until we purchase our permanent set, rings arrived in timely fashion, once I put them on............they are just gorgeous, absolutely stunning, I paired them with my 3 stone past present ring and with my sterling silver band, and they definitely hold their own. Looks like the real thing to the untrained eye, but could very well fool the trained eye. For the money you can't go wrong. Great Buy!"
1,So pleased with this ring. Simply beautiful and I love wearing them! It's definitely worth the money and I can't stop looking at my hand.
1,"If you wear this ring by itself on one hand, it really looks beautiful. I think it might start looking clunky with several other rings on one hand."
1,"I ordered a set of these rings on Oct 26th, and I received them in my mailbox yesterday (Nov 2). For some, that might not seem worth mentioning, but I am currently stationed overseas and it usually takes WEEKS and MONTHS for stuff to make it out to our little mailbox. Upon looking at the rings, I was just bowled over with how pretty they are. As some of the reviewers mentioned, two rings are identical in size and the third one is a tad bigger. Personally, I am okay with that! For me, wearing all three at the same time seemed a bit cumbersome so I am only wearing the bigger of the three stones right now to get used to wearing a ring at all (I went many years not wearing one). Already, I have gotten SO many compliments about how pretty my ring is, and how lucky I am that I have a husband to spend that kind of money on me. If they only knew!I would recommend this ring set to anyone, if I wanted to let them in on my little secret!Fast shipping, great price, wonderful product. I'm in love!"
1,"I read all the reviews so i ordered my own. Soooooo impressed! it is beautiful and it fits great, some people said that one of the bands stones are smaller than the other two, i cant tell. I am so impressed with these rings. Buy."
1,"it looks soooooo prettttyyyyy i love it!its very comfortable to wear. its not bulky at all. the rings stack themselves just right, it almost felt like its one banded ring. it fits right at size 5.one ring has bigger stones than the other two. the other two are identical. however the stones sizes are just right , it doesnt looke ""fake"" haha.its gorgeous!"
1,I bought these to wear when not wearing my diamond wedding band. Had concerns it would look cheap. To my surprise I started receiving positive comments on it immediately.
1,"I just received this great trio set. I was looking for something to replace my original wedding band that had lost diamonds. We really had no desire to buy a ""real"" one again at this point. I looked on Amazon for weeks and found this beauty!!I used the outer two to flank my engagement ring. They are the perfect size. Not too small thus making it hard to see, nor to big making it look fake and gaudy.I don't find them uncomfortable either. Very realistic looking!I've also added pictures of my flanked rings to their photo gallery!"
1,Rings are much shinier than shown in the picture. Great sparkle and more comfortable than I thought they'd be.
1,I bought these to serve as wedding bands and they are beautiful. The stackable effect is so pretty and the way the cz's shine makes them look expensive!
1,"Was looking for something for the wife for our 10 year anniversary and found this, wasn't sure what she would think of it but when she opened it her eyes lit up and she Loved it!"
1,Got this set for my mother-in-law birthday. she was so excited when she recieved it. she stated it was very pretty and looks very nice on her.
1,my GF loves this necklace and she has had a lot of good positive feedback on it to! this is a soid recommandation.
0,"the necklace is pretty, however, the clasp wont open far enough to attach to the chain so I cant even wear it."
0,"When I received this locket, I was very disappointed. It doesn't close correctly, and has light scratches all over it as though it had been rattling around someone's desk drawer for a year."
1,I love it - got lots of compliments.I am wanting to get the similar one with the different colors
1,This anklet is very cute and very simple. It offers you just enough to make your ankle look sexy.
1,These earrings are GORGEOUS! The picture doesn't do them justice. The way they sparkle in the sun is breathtaking!!!
1,My daughter absolutely loves these earrings. She put them on right awayafter she opened them on Christmas morning.
1,"I gave these away as a gift, but really wanted to keep them for myself."
1,"I just received this as a gift from my sister and it is just lovely. The stones are beautiful and the attention to detail on the sterling silver is exceptional. The fact that this piece is a pendant or a pin makes it as functional as it is pretty. It is unique and a true piece of art in my opinion. Each time I wear it I get so many compliments on it. It is a nice weight which allows it to hang nicely on any chain or ribbon. When I received it I could tell from the packaging (presentation) that it was a quality piece. I highly recommend this piece and am going to check out the other pieces by the same maker. Do not hesitate to send this to someone as a gift, they will love it as I do."
1,"If you are looking for great jewelry at a fraction of the cost, look no further! Eve's Addiction's offerings are wonderful, and their customer service and communication are fabulous. I bought this Moon and Stars Blue Enamel Ring about a month ago, and it is beautiful. The quality is good, the silver finish is very high quality, and the blue enamel and little CZ's embedded in the ring are perfect. It's durable, too. I wear it to work every day, and it has survived being shoved into the guts of a copier several times (getting loose toner all over it) and getting knocked around on hard surfaces. It looks as new as the day I got it. I wash my hands with it on and basically wear it everywhere except to bed. I will buy from Eve's Addiciton again. Also - recently bought my 12-year-old niece a pair of the Palm Tree CZ post earrings for her birthday, and they are beautiful - she loves them."
1,This is exactly the same as the item. packaged really well and some nice extra touches. think we will be buying from you again
1,I just replaced this ring from Old Glory. I lost my first one. People love it and so do I. I am glad to have it back. Looks very good.
0,I have just received this ring today and upon opening its package my first thought was
1,"Only paid around six dollars and didn't expect much so was pleasantly surprised to find that it is really very pretty. Looks much more expensive, but I feel free to wear it casually."
1,Very good customer service and value for this item. AAA+ for this merchant.
1,"It's prefectly well product for the pendant. very shining yellow color and bigger too, it looks very very beautiful. I think the citrine the yellow color is better than topaz one. fortunely, I choose the citrine one. it looks like a expensive pendant."
1,I bought a pair of these for my husband for his birthday and he really liked them. They are just the right size and color. The classic design makes them wardrobe staple. The quality is excellent!
1,"I bought these for my husband for our wedding (you know.. tying the knot! ha) and they were really nice. Classic looking and a great price! They came in a nice case which was kind of like a jewelry box and spring loaded, which ended up breaking pretty quickly, that was the only downside. My husband still wears these often and they look nice every time!"
0,I felt the picture did not show that the charm looked smaller than a baby charm. I was very disappointed for the money.
0,"The diamonds had black inclusions that seemed to occupy a major fraction of the diamonds volume. I expected something that would be visible on close inspection with the naked eye, but these are visible from 5 feet away ! They are the most dominant feature of the diamonds ! I have seem I2s before and needed a loop to see the includions. These are just unacceptable !Pretty much ruined a 50th birthday as a gift, these stones are junk.AVOID !"
0,"I don't know why I buy these things. I guess it's Lightning Deal anxiety.It is pretty much like it appears in the pictures. But up close it has a cheap, mass produced look to it. It's smaller than it appears, and if you saw it a flea market you might think it costs less than $5.I kept it, but wouldn't give it as a gift to someone I cared about.I'm somewhat disappointed with this purchase, even at the reduced Lightning Deal price I paid."
1,"Neckalace is awesome, I love it. I was so excited when it finally came in, its perfect for my Cosplay."
1,"If you follow the instructions, it works very well. I tested it on stones I knew were actual diamonds and on cz's and you could tell by the way it beeped what they were."
0,The picture and description for this ring set make the rings far more attractive than what they are up close and personal. The rings look like they are made of plastic - definitely not worth the money or 1 minute it takes to buy them. Extremely dissapointed.
1,I loved the belly ring. I need to order a new one because I lost one of the balls. The Shippment was fast and I loved it until I lost a peice of it.
1,"I wear it every single day! It is beautiful, its the right size. I've had it for a very long time and it has not yet dropped any of the stones.My 8 month-old son often grabs it and yanks on it and chews on it. Yes, I stop him but I've noticed that this is a very sturdy necklace as he sometimes pulls himself to his feet on my lap after grabbing the necklace. Amazing!I love it, great purchase!"
1,"I got this gift for my grandmother for Christmas, and she loved it. It's very pretty and well designed. But it is smaller than it appears to be in the picture, and the chain is very thin."
1,"I got this dragonfly necklace from my dad for Christmas. I pointed this necklace to my dad, so he knew what to get for me for Christmas. The necklace is prettier than the picture shown here. I love it."
1,"Just Gorgeous. The chain is a bit chinsy, but replaceable. The pendant is perfect, worth the price without the chain ($15)!"
1,I was pleasantly surprised how lovely this pendant is. Whoever designed the dragonfly did a very nice job. The CZ stones compliments the sterling silver dragonfly body. It all works together and I just wish they had some earrings to match it! Too bad it doesn't come in other gemstones for color. I would definitely buy this pendant again and you can not beat the price. These prices Amazon offers is comparable to costume jewelry.The only thing I would change is the chain it came with. It is of a thinner quality. I would try to find a longer and stronger chain for the pendant. It still deserves 5 stars for quality and beauty.
1,I bought this for my mother as a birthday gift. It is very pretty and she loves it. It can be worn casually and also looks nice more dressed up. It came in a little velvet bag which was inside a larger box. It was not tangled up when we opened it.
1,"dragon fly is just like the pic shows. chain is a bit thinner than i expected, but nice just the same."
1,This is a good value for the money. Wife has worn it since I gave it to her. Actually looks better in reality than in the photos.
0,"From the image, I thought this was fairly large. It's not in fact. I looks cheap too. I bought this as a gift and opted not to give it."
1,"beautifull dragon fly, great detail, great size not too small, chain is a bit on the skinny side though, but for the price, you can replace the chain..."
0,"I bought this ring along with another smoky quartz ring from the same vendor. This ring fit nicely, but the large stone was chipped, scratched and had numerous bubbles in it. The silver is 'heavy' looking, not delicate. The other ring had to go back because it was simply HUGE, and I didn't want something that big, but it was in excellent condition. It sat a good half an inch above the top of my finger and the stone was as wide. This ring was also big, but not overly so. Neither appeared like good quality rings but then for these prices, you can't really expect top quality."
0,"I bought this for taking the ""good jewelry"" with me when I travel, but it really lacks usable features. I found it too small to be practical.The ring bar is so skinny that your rings end up rubbing together. It does have a couple of small pockets in which you could put rings or small earrings, and two medium-sized zipper pockets that might hold a bracelet or small watch.If you really want to take your good stuff with you, look elsewhere. If you just want to bring a spare ring and a pair of earrings for a weekend, this would be okay."
1,"I love this necklace! What you see is what you get, it's exactly like the picture. Gorgeous!! It arrived much sooner than expected - a nice surprise. I was thrilled with the purchase, and I'm sure you will be too."
0,"Product was nice but looked a lot better in the picture it looked ""cheap"" once i got it in my hand, but my wife liked it."
0,Such a beautiful pendent disappointed with the chain.There was a small knot in it ? Beside that it wouldhave receive (5) star....
1,Came on time i love the Pendant. Purchased for my Fiance and she loved it. Highly recommend to any woman or for little girls that love shiny hearts.
0,"about this item for my girlfriend did not like the quality of the chain the chain was not 18 inches long I would not purchase this item again knowing that the chain-link this fake it's more like eight 12"" to 14"" chain"
1,"Love this necklace. I've had several necklace's over the years, but this is by far one of the best. I purchased one for my necie's 13th birthday and decided to get one for myself. I'm so happy that I did. We both love them. The quality and craftmanship of the heart is great, but the necklace is a little thin. I can always purchase a better necklace, but overall it's great."
1,My girlfriend loved it so I would say it was great. It was a great Christmas present for her because she loves heart shaped jewelry.
1,I think this is a beautiful necklace for the price. It seems to be good quality and it just sparkles. Love it!
1,This is a very nice looking pendant. It is not very expensive but looks like it could cost 10 Times what it cost. It appears to be of high quality and is durable.
1,"This heart looks very &#34;real&#34;...perfect size and quality is very nice. I put it on a different chain then the one that came with it as it was a shorter, thin one."
0,"I got these for my mother in law for Christmas. They are pretty, although not my style. The rubies are little tiny chips and they have ""made in china"" stamped on the back, whch drives me crazy. So, they are okay. A good weight, pretty earrings, but they say made in china."
1,I almost cried when I saw these earrings. They are so beautiful. They look like I paid alot of money for them. I love them very much I wear them everyday.
1,I could not be more pleased. These earrings are absolutely beautiful. There is a necklace that matched.....I just might have to buy that too.
1,I received these earrings for Christmas from my husband and they are beautiful. I love the detail and the way they hang. I especially like that they are lightweight. The unique design with the flower detail is wonderful. My husband definetly has good taste in selecting jewelry for me .
0,"Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the ""design"" of the earring. But after closer examination, I noticed that the ""blue"" stone was ""very light blue"". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your ""own"" eyes and not through fancy ""photoshop"" website with touchup/enhanced photos."
0,"I bought a size 8 and could not wear the ring on any finger. It's very small and will need to be returned. Would suggest buying a size bigger than you normally wear.The silver bands with the CZ stones are not very clear, almost white and it throws off the attractiveness of the whole ring. The Marcasite stones are very beautiful and would have balanced better with a truer silver."
0,The ring is beautiful and I loved it for about a week until one of the stones fell out.
1,I bought this item as a gift and the recipient is very pleased with the product. This was a good buy especially since it was a gift for my mom and she's fond of Marcasite.
1,I really love this ring. Fits well and is a good quality ring. I get lots of compliments on it.
0,"Its a FINE accessory... a great add-on to an all black or silver outfit... but my first ring had zirconias falling off, and tiny as it is, a missing stone doesn't look that great... i got a new one, but there is still that fear that stones might start coming off when i use it.overall, it looks great, a good accessory... but if you're looking for a more long-term, worry-free ring... that you won't have to check every so often if stones are missing... this is not for you."
0,"The ring is quite stunning, however, several of the stones have fallen out after two brief wearings. I usually do not purchase sterling silver fashion rings, so it might be common for stones to fall out easily. I received several comments on its beauty, however."
0,the ring looks very nice but the stones are not mounted very well. After wearing it for 3 months I lost several stones.
0,"I have had my ring for just over a month and was quite pleased with how it looked,however, I have just noticed there are already 2 stones missing and I am very disappointed."
1,I received this as a gift for Christmas after adding it to my Wish List.I have been wearing it pretty much everyday since then(8 months) and haven't had any problems with damage or wear and tear.I've received tons of complements on it and I just love how it looks on my hand.
0,I liked the ring at first sight. But I am disappointed that I have already lost some of the stones. Its only been a couple weeks.....
0,This ring is very poorly made. I purchased it for a valentines day gift. Within just a couple weeks three of the stones fell out. I sent it back in had it exchanged. I recieve the next one and within another two weeks two more of the stones had feel out. I called asked what to do and ended up having a very difficult return. Not only that but they tried to only give me 80 % back when I was entitled to a full 100. % I would not recommend this item to anyone what so every.
1,"I got this ring last year and I am very happy with it, it's very pretty and very comfortable!!! I love it!"
0,DO NOT BUY THIS RING BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT GET THIS RING THEY WILL SEND YOU A SIMILAR RING THAT IS FLAT THE PICTURE CLEARLY SHOWS THE ROWS ARE RAISED THE RING THEY SHIPPED IS FLAT AS A PANCAKE I CALL THIS BAIT AND SWITCH AND TOTALLY ILLEGAL!!!!
0,This is a great product if your naruto fan however the the neckless broke easily but the pendant is great.
1,So pleased with this item. Exactly what we were looking for for my granddaughter. She was so excited with it.
1,"I searched and searched for a product that looked decent and that did not have a published &#34;theme&#34; like Tinkerbell or the like. I wanted it to be timeless, yet fit her interest at the age of 4. I wanted it to be something that would last the years and sturdy enough to play with for years to come. This jewelry box is all of the above! I couldn't be happier, a year later. She couldn't be happier, either!"
0,"When I recived item ordered, it was cute, it looked like what I wanted, but it was broken. The fairy dancer that was suppose to be standing was broken off. It was a Christmas gift, I was dissappointed."
0,Paper peeling off. Looks better in the photo that it does when it arrives. Not durable at all. I returned it.
0,"To be honest, I didn't expect much given the cost, but was still disappointed to find out the box is made of cardboard (albeit very sturdy cardboard). Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Still, it's meant for a child which means it's not going to last forever regardless of what it's made of."
1,Looks better than pictured! It looks larger in real life than in photo! Great Quality! Will buy again from this Company
1,"I do not know what one reviewer is complaining about, mentioning ""small sticker on bottom warning that music box contains lead...""; there is no such sticker on the bottom of mine. Perhaps my box is a newer version? The box is 10 times nicer looking than the picture! It is educational in the wonderment of its compartments, and it is well made. You can not go wrong purchasing this for a gift. It is beautiful at any price! Fit for any princess!"
1,I brought this jewelry box for my daughters 5th birthday. I looked every where for one with a horse but they just were not right. When i found this one I fell in love with it. I prayed it was what I wanted. When I opened the box it was even better. My daughter loved it she spends hours arranging her stuff and watching the horse spin and the music play. She looks at the pictures all the time and reads the saying on it. When my other daughters turn 5 this is what I will buy them too.
1,I bought this box for my 5 year old and a similar one for my 2 year old from Enchantmints. They are both beautiful and the girls LOVE them. By far the best gifts (and cheapest) this Christmas!! The toys are already in the toy box and forgot while these are taken from the dresser to the bed so they can listen and watch them every morning and night. Also a great place to put those most important necklaces.
1,"I bought this necklace for a guy friend of mine. He's a very close friend so it had to be just right. I was little skeptical about the necklace when I ordered it, but when it got here I was very pleased. It was larger then I thought it would be and it was nice and heavy. It was perfect down to the last detail. When I gave the gift to my friend he was thrilled. The fit was perfect and he even loved the tin the necklace came in. Said he could use it for storing things. It was well worth the money spent and I would recommend it to anyone."
0,At least that's what I felt. I was hoping I could wear it casually but I can't because it's so bulky.
1,gave a pair to daughter and one for me love love love them and we both needed the right studs these are them
1,Jewelry and select items from around the globe. The Ocean Cross was an exquisite piece of workmanship from the NOVICA collection of artists from various countries. It should be noted that each item ships from its country of origin so if it's for a gift allow time for delivery.
0,"This bracelet, although relatively inexpensive, is too cheaply made. The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off. The emblem comes off (as mine did) as it is just glued on. The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all. Not recommended at any price."
0,"The medalion is pretty basic and standard, but they didn't put a clasp in the chain, and after a few weeks the chain broke."
1,took it off the chain and put it on a charm bracelet - my cousin loved it -- older lady and she was self conscious about telling the world about her &#34;personal business&#34; looks like a nice piece of jewelry - good shine and size.
1,"The ring is beautiful, so much so that when my teenage daughter cracked and broke hers after a lot of abuse, she requested this same version of the Claddagh. Something even more important to me is this is one of almost a dozen items I've purchased from this company from jewelry to a fabulous mortar and pestle set. Shipping is quick, items are exactly as stated. Taos is trust worthy and I am very, very happy with every item I've purchased from them."
1,"I had been searching for a Claddagh righ for a while and I came across this one. It was just what I wanted. When my boyfriend got the ring he loved it! He thought it was nice that it told him what it meant, since he didn't know the meaning of it. All around a great gift to buy. &lt;3"
1,"Loved this ring. It arrived exactly as pictured. I bought it for my 13-year old daughter for Christmas. She wears it all the time, and receives many compliments/questions about it. It feels very solid, not like some flimsy ones we've seen at stores that cost double the price. (She's wanted one ever since she was watching old episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" on DVD, and saw Angel give Buffy a beautiful ring like this.)"
1,"I've been looking for a good sized Claddagh ring for some time now all over the internet and I'm so glad that I decided to go with this one! The ring is a good size, not too large for a woman, and the design is beautiful! I love it! It's a fantastic ring, with a fantastic price!"
1,"My dad got this ring for me, so he's letting me write this review on his account.I love this ring! The two pictures of it on here don't do it justice. When I got it, it was nicely packaged in a little baggie inside a white cardboard box with foam, and it fit perfectly. Everything is proportional--no disturbingly large heart or deformed hands, and the silver doesn't tarnish easily. However, it's fairly malleable and easy to scratch if you're not careful. I got a little scratch mark on the surface of the heart, and it's not really noticeable to anyone (except myself) but it still kind of bothers me. Even if I end up breaking it I'll probably buy another of the same. :)"
1,I bought this for my best friend for her birthday. It came and it was so lovely that I had to give it to her as soon as I got it. She loves it and I would recomend this ring with no regrets.
1,This high quality Claddagh ring was the perfect Christmas gift! My daughter loved everything about it from it's high polished shine to the way it feels on her hand. She has had many complements and wears it everyday. I would buy from this seller again. Fast shipping and packaged nicely too! Thank you!
1,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. It was supposed to be delivered between Thursday and Tuesday - it arrived Wednesday, a day early, safely packaged. :)The ring seems durable, and is absolutely beautiful. Definitely not too large for a woman, it seems feminine and sweet. I'm so excited to wear it every day. If you're going for a claddagh ring at a decent price, this is definitely the one."
1,"I ordered three of these rings based on other people's reviews. They are very pretty, a nice weight, and everyone loved them! I would recommend this ring."
0,"The stones in these earrings are a lot paler than shown in the picture. If the earrings had been accurately depicted, I would not have purchased them."
1,"The shape is flattering to the neckline and unlike other collars I own, it lays flat around the neck and required no adjustment. Although light in weight, it is not flimsy and stays in place. The V-shape, 17"" length and and 3mm size is perfect for pendants with smaller bails."
1,"This chain is truly lovely and looks good with any type of pendant. The length is perfect and the chain has a nice shimmer. It is delicate enough in appearance that it is a very classy-looking chain and dresses up an outfit. It is also strong and durable; it stands up to frequent use. It's my ""go-to"" chain when I'm getting ready to go out. I will purchase more of this type of chain."
1,"I love this earrings. I was looking for some red jewelry to go with my gameday outfits (go UGA!) and these are great. The color is actually a deeper red than the picture, but they're pretty big and shiny. I love them."
1,"When I originally received this ring, I noticed a flaw in the stone. I e-mailed the distributer and they quickly replaced it with a new one of excellent quality. I would recommend this company any day."
0,"Elated is how I felt when I received this bracelet as a gift. Disappointed is how I am with the fact that it's so small. By adding just 1/4 to 1/2 an inch more to this bracelet I could enjoy wearing it so much more. At 7"" it's too small to wear comfortably. I'm looking into trying to find a way to add length but haven't found one yet. As for the color and style, they are just what I would want in this type of bracelet...the only thing holding me back from giving it more stars is the size."
1,"This will be one of the gifts for my grandniece on graduation. She will have the necklace and ring to go with it. As it is her birthstone, and she doesn't have any blue topaz jewelry yet, this will be perfect."
1,I got this as a present after putting it on my wish list. I love it. It is really delicate and pretty. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry.
0,the chain of this product is really thin that you are worried all the time it is possible to be cut off but the butterfly's size is not that much badit is not a good present for your wife or girlfriendremember that
1,I purchase this item for my girlfriend and it was a Christmas present the girl while to open it is how I wrapped it when she opened it she loved it
0,Nice piece but is very small. I guess I should have read the dimensions in more detail to pick a better gift.
0,"After 4 months of use, one of the stones were lost. I don't know any other person who would take care of her jewerly than my wife. I a shame i couldn't get anything better for her."
1,"I think I have an addiction to Amazon.com Collection Jewelry. I have purchased more pieces than I can count and these earrings are just one pair that I enjoy wearing. The size is great, actually a bit bigger than I expected so that was nice and I've already received several compliments. You can't beat the price for these beauties!"
1,These ruby CZ studs look rich. They are of high quality. The recipient talked about how hard it is to find red earrings - period. She was pleased with the beauty and quality of her gift.
1,"I received these earings and the matching necklace as a gift. Unfortunately it does not appear that the necklace is currently available. However as stand alone pieces the earings are beautiful and simple. As such they can be worn on a daily basis. Contrary to another review the finish is the same as appears on the website. The size is appropriate for almost any face shape. They are very comfortable, and not too heavy at all."
0,"Awful, Embarrasing, Deceptive, [PUT YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT WORD HERE], this was by far one of the most deceptive purchases I've ever made, jewelry DOES NOT look as pictured, is definitively smaller and finishing is slightly below average, I'll never buy jewelry online again... Hard time returning due to the looks, luckily they screwed up on shipping times and I was entitled to a return (just by the looks they WILL NOT take it back)."
1,"I wear this necklace every day and am delighted when someone recognizes it. I recommend it to Bleach fans not only as a collector piece, but as an awesome necklace."
1,This belly ring is my new favorite!!! It is very well made and worth the money!! Thanks!!! We'll do business again!!
1,These are really great earrings- inexpensive and interesting without being too expensive. I wouldn't mind having a second pair.
1,I have received many of compliments for these pair of earrings. I have really enjoyed wearing them out in public. They never tarnish. You can wear them with just about anything or just by themselves. I am hoping a necklace will appear to me while I shop Amazon.com to match the earrings with. Very good choice and will recommend them to my friends.
0,"Be very careful when you open this one... and when you try to unknot the chain the first time. The chain this necklace came with was very flimsy, and broke the first time the recipient tried to put it on. It has a standard round clasp, not a lobster claw clasp, and anyone with fingernails will have difficulty putting it on. Also the way the chain wraps around the pendant ( A half hitch around five independent silver rings ) makes knotting even more of a burden.While the gift itself, (paired with the eternity ring earrings) won praise, I was fortunate to have had the foresight to purchase a stronger replacement 20"" silver chain that worked better."
0,"This necklace was not a bad purchase. Once I received it, I was not crazy about it. The chain had a large not in it when it arrived (4 weeks after I ordered it). I would not purchase this item again."
0,"Be aware, these are actually fairly heavy earrings. I find I can't wear them often without discomfort."
1,These earrings I bought for a friend who loves pink. She will be excited with the elegant styling of this gift.
1,"I love these earrings, they are my favorite. I would love to get another pair to give to my daughter!"
1,"I actually got this for the sole purpose of matching my Halloween costume (it's a Gothic theme), but when I opened the pouch & was shocked!! It's a good weight (not too heavy, but noticeable). I thought the necklace would be big & overpowering, but the stones are a nice size, about the size of my pinky nail, if not a tad smaller) & the links holding them together is strong, so it doesnt look like it'll snap.I was a a bit concerned about the clasp. It's an ""S"" shape that you slide the ring into so the necklace is secure, but I learned to use it quickly. The rings are big so if I wanted to have a jeweler put in a regular lobster clasp I can. I may wear this more often.I'm VERY glad I brought this. Not only is it real silver & Onyx, but I paid LESS than I would have buying a costume necklace (about $25 for ONE!).--->MiNA&lt;3"
1,This little lamb is just perfect for the Twilight Saga bracelet.It does symbolize Bella's character very well. Cute as a button.
1,"I wear this cartouche often. It is pretty and has a nice feel to it. This cartouche is a good quality, thick piece. I have 2 other cartouches (one silver, one gold), purchased in Cairo, that are much thinner. This one is especially pretty with the gold on the silver and I like the idea of wearing the word ""peace""."
1,It's beautiful. We were looking for a ring that doesn't sit high off the finger and it's perfect. She absolutely loved this ring. It's exactly as pictured. We've had problems with rings with rough edges and irritation from other dealers but this one is smooth and perfect for everyday wearing. She even sleeps and showers with it on with no problem.
0,"I bought this ring a couple of months ago for everyday wear. At first it was great- cute, unique, etc. Then I noticed the latch getting snagged in EVERYTHING, from my clothes to blankets to my bag... After a while, the very poorly made latch became bent out of shape, and now does not close properly.The ring itself is made nicely enough, and is a very cute design. However, the latch is way too pliant and easily bent. The hook on the top will get caught on any stray thread. I would not recommend this ring for everyday use- maybe as a formal or costume piece to be worn every once in a while."
1,"This was a gift to a friend, and she absolutely loved it! It isn't obscenely large even on her little fingers. It's classy and functional. A great price for a great product. I may end up getting one for myself."
1,"I was very happy with this ring! So was my sister, who recieved it! I thought it was prettier, once I saw the real product. She hasn't taken it off since she recieved it! It looks like it was a hit!"
1,"These earrings are beautiful! Kind of smaller than I expected, but they are very well made and very pretty! My wife loves them!"
1,We bought these firey opal earrings with an antique (rose gold) finish for daughter's birthday. She was delighted!
1,I love this ring! It is so beautiful. The gem catches the light and has a fantastic sparkle. The band is nicely polished and shines just as much as the gem!The gift box is very cute.
0,I bought this ring this year and am still wearing it - they have large sizes for my big fingers. I love it
0,"What a disappointment. The stones are really pink and the clasp often comes undone. Also, note the size...they are tiny."
1,"These Garnet Earrings are beautiful! They are well worth the price. No problems at all. Purchased as a gift for my aunt, and she loved them too. Highly recommended to anyone thinking of purchasing."
0,"These are pretty earrings but the first time I went to put them on, one of the stones fell out and I had to return them. They are cheaply made and I do not recommend them."
0,I purchased these as a gift for my aunt off of her wish list. During a recent visit to her house she informed me that a stone had fallen out of one of her earrings. She had it fixed (at a large expense) then only to have more stones fall out of both pair.
0,"These earrings are smaller than they appear, the stones are very pale making them hard to see."
0,"I purchased these as a gift for my wife. She loved them, they are very pretty and dainty. However, after 3-4 uses, several of the stones popped out and we were unable to fix it. It was too late to return them, so we just threw them out. Due to the design, the earring bends a little each time you put them on or off. It's really a shame, because they are quite nice, but, it's only a matter of time before the stone(s) will pop out."
1,"These were exactly what I expected for the $20 I paid. The garnets aren't the darkest I've ever seen, but they are pretty and the earrings sparkle."
1,"I absolutely love these earrings, I bought these for my 3 year old daughter last christmas, and they look beautful, they never have tarnished or fallen out...She is always complimented on them, needless to say she is very much into jewelery....I great buy. She is still wearing them and never takes them out."
1,"these are noticeable green, they are smaller than I imagined, but they are not to small, they do not feel heavy on my ears and trading them for a stud feels no different in weight. the clasp seems strong so they wont fall out."
0,The earrings aren't so charming because of very pale stones. In reality they are nice but no more than that.
1,"These Silver PeridotHoop Earings pleased my wife a lot they have a good substantial ""feel"" to them, she loves the classic secure clasp lock and they complemented the Periodot Celtic Silver Necklace purchased thru Amazon from Silver Insanity last year.Happy Amazon Shopper"
1,another ring i wear all the time with no dents or bends! i wear it as a pinky ring and it looks great
1,"I needed a box for a necklace destined to be a gift and had rather low expectations for this unit. Boy was I wrong. This is a very well made little box of decent heft. The hinge is straight, the black velvet exterior and gold-toned metal strip are well fit and finished. Open it up and you will find an up-angled black velvet trapezoidal display ""shelf"" that holds the pendant or necklace up for display. The lining on the lid's interior resembles a white satin-type fabric with a perfectly centered x-shaped pucker that really looks nice. Assuming they are all built like this you can't go wrong. If I ever need a similar box I'm buying another with no hesitation."
1,"Purchased this to hold a necklace I purchased from a discount site. I didn't want to pay full price just to have a pretty box for the same item. Purchasing this separately allowed me to purchase more gifts for my family,while still presenting the items in professional packaging."
1,This little box came quickly and the material was rather comfortable to the touch. Nothing fancy or too special but rather classy. I used to hold a necklack and the gift receiver seemed to love it. Cheers!
1,"I bought my sister a pretty necklace via Groupon, but it arrived in a plastic bag. Fair enough, considering the deal I got on it, but certainly not suitable to gift in. I was happy to find that you can get jewelry boxes like this via Amazon, and it made for a much more dramatic and elegant gift, as if I'd bought it in a jewelry store. If I buy a necklace for anyone again, you can bet I'll be picking up another box like this for the gifting."
1,"These are beautiful and a GREAT bargain. A little smaller than I thought they would be judging from the picture, but they are just perfect. I bought the matching necklace too."
0,"I ordered these earrings for my wife for Christmas. The emeralds are very, very, poor quality, don't even look like emeralds, they are milky white, nothing like the ones represented on their web site. I contacted Fred Meyer Jewerly, explained the problem, I can return them, but I have to pay the return shipping and insurance. I feel that since the stones were so badly miss represented, that they should pay the return, but they refuse. I will never order from thenm again."
0,"I did not expect much for the price, but was nevertheless disappointed.There were quite large visible inclusions (esp. in the main stone and in one of the side stones) which allowed only a few light reflections within the stones (large parts of the stones looked simply ""blind"").In addition, the gold ring was shaped uneven and asymmetrical.Maybe I just got a really bad one...I would not feel comfortable giving this ring to anyone, so I returned it (bought a smaller one with cleaner stones and a whole lot more sparkle)."
1,"I purchased these earrings over a year ago, and have worn them 24-7 since then. None of the stones have ever fallen out, nor are any of them loose. As I said, I never take them out, so I sleep, swim, run, hike, etc with them in and have never had them fall out of my ears or has issues with the earrings themselves.The stones aren't the deep purple you see in the picture, but more of a dark lavender shade, but still very pretty. The silver is still bright & shiny, no tarnishing or black marks on my skin, and the closure is still secure. All in all, definitely a good purchase for the price."
0,This ring is of OK quality. I find the sizes to run a little small. I probably wouldn't buy another of these.
0,Bought these for myself since I like amethyst. They appear cheaply made and there is a loose stone on one of the earrings which I thankfully discovered before it was lost. Couldn't recommend them based on the poor craftmanship
0,"These earrings are pretty, but hard to open. I had to tug on them quite a bit to get them to open, and I thought I was going to break them. Also, the box isn't fancy, which detracts from giving these as a gift."
1,these earrings are beautiful.. a bit smaller than I expected but the color of the stones are beautiful .. a deep purple and I was aprhensive after reading the reviews of others so I checked the stones .. none are loose and every thing seems to be top quality. They arived 4 days sooner than I was told so that was a big plus for me as they are a birthday gift to myself.I will definately order this same earring with different stones in it.
0,"After I wore these earrings 3 times, when i took them off, there was one missing stone-i feel i should be reimbersed or get them replaced. I really loved them and am very disappointed. After I notified Amazon, they sent me a new pair of earrings free and I wear them all the time. Thanks Amazon.com"
1,This ring was absolutely perfect!!! And the gift box it came in was so pretty I put it in my curio. I would definitely buy from this store again. It's become my new favorite!
1,This ring is beautiful! I have been searching for a pretty peridot ring for years now and finally found this one. I love it I wish I had one in every color now.
1,"Peridot Gemstone Band .925 Sterling Silver RingThis ring is beautiful work of art, I love the way it was made, many comments on the styleand color of the gemstone."
0,"In my opinion, the stone was not of a high quality and did not reflect light."
0,when i first get this ring is looked great. Then the citrine started to fade.It now looks like clear glass with a little color. I was heart broken.I will send it back.
1,"I chose this product for the size and price and I am happy with the earrings.The earrings are as described,they come in a little black pouch and would make a cute gift!"
1,makes a nice gift to a young girl or young woman. This pair of earrings were made by the same company that sells EternaGold on QVC.
0,"I have been wearing the pair as basic studs for 2 months (not continuously). The color on the back of one of the studs already turned from gold to brown. Normally 14K gold shouldn't do that. 10K gold would change color easily. Also I'm allergic to certain metal so have to wear only gold or silver. I'm not allergic to other 14k gold studs/earrings I have but with this one that had the color change, my ear feels pain/itchy like when I wear those cheap metal studs."
0,"i guess I didn't realize how small 5mm is. These are a good size for agirl, but a little small for a woman. I don't wear particularly largeearrings, but these are very small."
1,they are nice however little smaller than I thought but that's my fault for not bringing out my metric rule... Very much recommend
0,"This purchase was very disappointing. Yes, the gold ball is pretty, but it measures less than 4 mm! I did not want to spend the money returning them, so I wear them once and a while, but I am not happy about them at all. So much for trusting information on the internet. Next time I'll buy them in a store, so I can see what size they really are."
0,"The earrings are pretty, but as other reviewers have noted the backs are very, very small, and they do slip right off of the post. The post are quite a bit shorter than average also. Mine were also packaged poorly"
1,Not too big and not too small... doesnt squeeze ears not even in sleep fits great. Will order more soon!
1,"Perfect for daily wear, size is great, big enough to decorate, without being over powering."
0,1st and formost I did not want to give this thing one star but page will not save unless you choose atlease 1. This bracelet was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my mother in law. I paid $160 for it and was extremely disappointed when I received it. It was about to fall apart. and very cheep and fake looking. I have contacted the Company Palm Beach Jewelers and they have guaranteed me a full refund upon shipment of the product back to them. I will be shipping out this weekend and hopefully they refund me as promised.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED :(
1,"I had a similar bracelet stolen from my luggage, so I hoped this would be of similar quality. I was pleasantly surprised. The $ per-gram value is excellent, and the bracelet is acceptably hefty. It doesn't pull the little hairs on your arm like some do. It's flexible and easy to wear even with a watch or other bracelet."
1,"I purchased this chain for my Mother for her birthday, and not only did I get it really quick it was beautiful. It looks very expensive compared to the price I paid for the chain. This chain is strong and it makes a great gift, it's a great buy for the price."
1,"It is a narrower byzantine than I have seen, a little over a quarter inch width. I like this better, the byzantine can be overdone. It is a beautiful necklace and look. It makes a statement without overpowering. Great price for such a well made necklace. Thank you Amazon."
1,"The chain is just as they specify. After doing some checking on eBay, I found that I couldn't touch a chain of this weight, 7.2g unless I was willing to spend almost twice as much! It also came a full size presentation box which was a nice touch."
1,"This is a very nice chain at a great price, especially compared to everything else I was looking for. I would recommend it if you don't like really big/heavy jewelry."
1,"All the others are only 3mm, and for a guy the 4mm size is better I think."
1,THIS BRACELET IS ALL THAT !! VERY NICE !! MY WIFE JUST LOVED IT !!
1,"This was the first time I've ordered jewelry off Amazon.com, and I was really impressed by the quality of the chain. I chose this necklace as a gift for my boyfriend, after about 3 months of looking at different chains--online and in stores. The chain stood out because I have not seen this style anywhere else--it's unique. I like it because it's not plain, but it's also not fancy to the point of girlie-ness. To my taste, it's just right. The photos don't do it justice; it's beautiful, and my boyfriend seems to be very happy with it. I was a little nervous about buying a necklace I hadn't physically seen and touched, but the expectations I had about the quality, appeal, and value were definitely exceeded."
1,"THE PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICK, WAS MUCH BETTER THAN PICTURED,NOW I KNOW I DONT NEED TO SHOP AT PACKED MALLS.....THIS WAS PAINLESS FIRST TIME I BOUGHT JEWERLY ONLINE WAS A BIT AFRAID BUT NOT ANYMORE A++++++"
0,"The bracelet was very nice quality, but after wearing it for only one week the clasp broke and I almost lost it."
1,I bought this necklace for my wife for Christmas and she was very pleased with it.
1,"My husband bought me a diamond pendant at Christmas which came with an extremely fine chain - it looked too frail. I have searched in all of the jewelry stores in our local mall and to purchase something of this quality in white gold, I would have needed to spend nearly as much as the pendant cost! I suspected that this one might also be too fine because of the great price, but couldn't believe it when I not only saw the quality, but realized that it had a lobster claw clasp - all of the chains in the stores had a spring ring clasp. Thanks Amazon - I will definitely purchase more jewelry from you."
1,"I replaced a very fine chain on a diamond, amethyst cross with this chain and seldom take it off. I've had it for at least a year and it has held up well and looks nice. The price is very good too."
1,"I could hardly wait to open the box upon it's arrival, and I was thrilled when I did. This bracelet is very unique and very different.......feels very ""weighty"" and just looks awesome on my arm. Once you get it on your wrist, the right way, the gold links will lie flat....this takes one or two tries, but the result is worth it..... and that shine!This was my first gold item from Amazon, and I am afraid, NOT my last!!"
1,"This is one of my most treasured pieces of jewelry. I received it as a gift last year after putting it on my Amazon.com wish list. I have received more compliments on this particular necklace than any other piece of jewelry I own. This is completely worth every penny. As the previous person said in their comment, this is much more beautiful in person. It goes with just about anything, and it is a major eye catcher. Wear this and you'll be center of attention."
1,"everyone has commented on how gorgeous this necklace is! the craftsmans attention to detail combined with reasonable pricing makes this pendant a great gift, or purchase for oneself!"
1,jewelry&watches;I was very happy when i received my order Gold Handmade Link bracelet.ExcellentThank you
0,"I had this beautiful bracelet for 3 weeks before the clasp started to become loose. Even with the secondary clasp, it fell of at my company x-mas party (4 weeks after purchase) and was never to be found. Someone got a very nice x-mas gift from me. I suggest that the making of the clasp be improved, and would not recommend the purchase of this item until then.Jim"
1,"I got these just for fun, and they are really cute! They are of a nice quality and just the right size...and for the low price, they exceeded my expectations."
1,"This is the second pair of gold earrings i've ordered from Amazon.com's line of gold jewelry. They look to be of really good quality, a tad smaller than i expected, but when worn, they're the perfect size. And they'll be perfect for my little girl when it's time to pass these to her. When browsing, i choose Amazon.com's jewelry line first, particulary for the usual free shipping, but now i know i'll get good quality for th price, too."
1,neckless with a letter M all with diamonds
1,I sent these as a gift to my mom and all her friends want a pair now.
0,"Ok, the stick doesn't come in a box. It is shipped in a plastic bag along with a little felt bag that is less than half the length of the stick itself. The felt bag is kinda useless. Lastly it need more than a bit of polishing. Granted these are minor sounding things but it is a bday gift for a friend and I was hoping it would present better than it actually does. It also has a noticeable curve to the stick which may or may not be normal (I don't know about jewelry related things, but you have been warned)."
1,"Always a little unsure about buying jewelry on line as I have been disappointed in the past. The product was delivered as promised and the cut, color and clarity was surprisingly much better than I had expected. Would buy from this reseller again!"
0,"I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal. Not so. The stone is clearly costume jewelry. It is an ugly white translucent stone with barely a hint of color. Also, the stones are on hooks, NOT attached solidly with a full loop so the 'gems' keep falling off the base with any movement. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,"I bought this pendant for my mom who absolutely loved it. The item came in a lovely box and arrived less than a week of ordering it. It is a beautiful pendant and such a great for my mom. I highly recommend ordering this item as a gift for someone. Harris Michael Jewelry, you are a wonderful company and I plan on buying again."
1,I paid about ten dollars with a special promotion discount. This necklace will make a nice gift for a little girl or young lady. The quality is good for the price.
0,"It is alot smaller than I had originally thought, but overall it is pretty nice, the gf likes it enough and wears it."
1,"I love this, it's the perfect size, a solid weight & a good value. It's almost like a choker length but still on the medium to delicate side."
1,The necklace is beautiful. I found the chain a perfect length since I'm still nursing and it's just short enough that my baby can't rip it off me. Also at $16 (I got it on sale) it's a fabulous deal. Even at full price it would be a great gift for any girl.
1,"I bought 3 of these thinking that I would give them all as Christmas gifts, but I ended up keeping one for myself because once I saw it in person, I love it! Totally a steal for its price."
1,This looks very nice for the price. I would recommend getting this one on here then going to the store.
1,"Great item and I'm still wearing it , love Marcasite jewerly and wash dishes sometines be forgetting I have it on."
0,"This ring looks red, but it is not. It also looks like a solid color, again it is not. My ring in orange and transparent. I wanted this to match a red outfit, now I have a useless orange translucent ring."
1,"I am in love with this ring. It's a beautiful solid red ring with slight variation of other colors. It's it is also durable, I know I see a few reviews saying that when the ring fell it shattered. Mine has fallen from me a few times and I am glad to say it is still in one piece. If you're looking for a casual everyday ring this is it."
1,I love this ring as well as the others I have bought from them. It has markings inside it that came from the stone this was made from and I love wearing its a 6 and a little to big but I still wear it when I can. I adore this ring and its unique qualities.
1,"I actually purchased two rings because I was so worried that the first would break after just a day or two. I have been wearing it non-stop. I even sleep and shower in it. I feel it is very sturdy and the thickness of the band gives me confidence that it won't shatter, no matter what I do. Perhaps the manufacturer has changed the width of the ring based on prior reviews but I would say that it's a sturdy band, and now I have one to wear and one to give as a gift!"
1,PRODUCT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY NICE AND SAFE AND IT IS A VERY NICE RING. ITS HARD TO TELL WHEN A RING IS 6MM OR 5MM FOR I HAVE A FEW OF BOTH AND THEY ARN'T ALL THE SAME SIZE SO I'M NOT SURE WHICH WIDTH I LIKE THE BEST.JUST HOPE I DON'T BREAK IT.
0,"Received this ring, unlike the picture shown here at amazon the ring was more of a rusty orange color and not at all like the deep red shown in this picture. Also the customer service from Gem Avenue is terrible!"
0,"This is pretty, but really, really small. I bought it as a gift for someone who can pull off dainty, and it's not like I *didn't* expect delicate, but I didn't process what the given dimensions meant when I ordered it. (Okay, so maybe I was also in a Christmas present-buying panic. I didn't say it wasn't my fault.)Anyway, pull out a ruler and see just how small 12 millimeters really is, just so you know what you're getting."
0,"This is a low priced diamond ring, and you get what you pay for.The diamond itself is in a fairly raised setting, but the diamond is very shallow inside of the setting. Basically, it only looks good when you are viewing it from the top. From the sides you can see how little diamond there is.The diamond I received was quite yellow in tinge, I compared it to a $200 diamond ring that my sister owns. Also, it lacked much of the brilliance or sparkle that I saw in the other ring. The other diamond was also much larger, which already makes up for the price different.Even for the money I was disappointed in the quality because I felt like a cubic zirconia would have been much better, as this diamond did not stand out at all."
1,"This is not the kind of ring for you if you want something ostentatious. It is beautiful though, thin band and very small diamond, but still very elegant and eye-catching. I love to see how it looks in my hand...!! I hope this helps you if you're considering buying it."
0,"The product arrived damaged. I tried to call the store several times, but nobody ever answered the phone. I left a voicemail for customer service, but never received a followup call. I sent them an email as well, but again, no response. Save yourself the headache and buy another product from a more reliable store."
0,I bought these earring because I had a pair that I loved which were identical that I received as a gift. The problem was that my original pair were not sterling silver so they really irritated my ears. I then found these here on eve's addiction and ordered them because they were sterling silver but as I quickly found out they are not because they also really irritate my ears and I know for a fact sterling ones do not. If you are looking for quality earrings unfortunately these are not the right pair for you!! I wish I had not have spent the money.
1,The anklet was exactly as shown. Good quality and excellent service. I would buy from them again.
0,"even though product was very inexpensive, product showed up at my house broken and falling apart. not a good value at all."
1,This was a gift purchase that I was thrilled to give. I was so pleased with the workmanship of the pendant and the recipient was delighted.This is a substantial piece with some weight. The silver workmanship is very well done and the stones smooth and unblemished. I really like that the pendant is reversible so it is like 2 Pendants in one. I also ordered the neckchain from this same company. It is a perfect pair.I am looking at purchasing several more of these for wonderful gifts for the Holidays. AT this price point they are very affordable and look like a much more expensive piece of jewelryVery very pleased with this purchase and the items arrived promptly.
1,"This pendant is very cute! The stones on mine were a bit darker than in the pics but, still pretty. More like Dark Rusy color/Hunter Green. The detail all the way around the pendant is beautiful too.I bought it's sister necklace too (Lapiz on front and Turquoise on back)and Love them BOTH! It's like getting 4 necklaces for the price of 2! The prices are so good though, It's really like getting 4 pendants for the price of 1 average necklace.Boo to regular necklaces. I am in love with reversibles!!!"
1,Love this piece of jewelry. It is complimented well by a short leathernecklace or silver chain
1,"I got the usual excellent quality and service when I bought this piece directly from Body Candy. Their prices are unbeatable, and in my experience, the quality is exactly the same as pieces you could pay much more for in a piercing shop (often, literally the exact same pieces of jewelry).I think the photography on this piece is a little odd. A labret, no matter where you wear it, won't primarily be seen from the side, and it's hard to tell what the colors of the ball will look like when shown at this angle, one on top of the other. To make it a little clearer, what you'd see looking down at the ball from the top would be a pinwheel of two different greens"
1,I wish Peora would have like most of the other ring sellers and have you choose a size instead of just Size 12...I bought this ring for the size since I don't want to wear rings on my ring finger and am not a thumb person.So I bought this ring and another thinking at least they will fit.They fit well and look amazing.The silver is .952 sterling silver.The Swiss Topaz (December birthstone) is stunning.Even if the topaz is fake (which I doubt) it is still an awesome ring.Very happy.
1,"I love this bracelet. I bought it for a friend as a birthday gift and I think I will buy another for myself. The color is nice, not too ""lime"" as I was originally afraid and the clasp on the bracelet keeps it secure. Its trendy and inexpensive...A must have!"
1,I purchased for my daughter at her request as birthday present and she was very very pleased with it. I can tell after many years which are pleased but just to please me or presents she really likes. This one she really liked. Thanks
1,this has to be by far the coolest bracelet i own! the black cuff makes it! it truly makes an outfit work! everyone loves it!!
1,i ordered this ring on a saturday and it came the following thursday afternoon. i absolutely love this ring so much! it fits nicely and is so PRETTY. i am SO happy i bought it! i came in a small cute box! i would DEFINITELY recommend it!
1,"If this is the type of ring you are looking for, then this ring is an absolute must to have. I had been looking for something on these lines for sometime and was really thrilled when I saw it and have not been disappointed."
0,Size seems to run a bit smaller but I am keeping as a gift for my niece. Not as thick as I would have liked but for the price it is a nice buy.
1,"this bracelet is a great deal for what u get, it is very dark n black so canbe worn with black diamonds or black spinel. the clapse is solid n secure, though oddly flat, but nothing that takes away from the overall design. if u r looking for a 'black diamond' look tennis bracelet, then this is it."
1,"I love this ring! My birthstone is Ruby and it appeared that color in the picture. When it arrived, it has a slightly more pink tone, however, it is still very nice and I like it. I ordered a size 8 for a thin thumb ring and it was a perfect fit. Fast shipping and great service. I will most definitely buy from this seller again!"
1,I had a mother of pearl bracelet with rectangular stones/shells and searched for the perfect earrings to go with it. These are about an inch long and match perfectly! Love them. Shipping was speedy.
1,Bought this pendant as a gift and wanted something that looked expensive and well made without paying a fortune and I was not disappointed.
1,I'm a musician and I'm always looking for unique way to express myself. This nose ring is perfect and highly recommend buying from this seller!!
0,"I was surprised at how small this charm was. The photo is very much enlarged and the dimensions are not mentioed. For the price, the piece should have been larger. The details are very nice but the size is wrong."
1,"My sister bought this ring and I just fell in love with it. We both have a Tiffany look-alike Palm Tree Necklace and this ring goes with it perfectly. Great quality ring and no one will ever know you're not wearing real diamonds.Liz McBurlington, NJ"
1,"Yes, the cross is quite delicate and prone to breakages, but this is a piece of jewlery and not a toy. I have had mine for several years now. I always remove mine last thing at night for safe keeping."
1,"They are the right size but everybody notice them. They are beautiful is a great, great buy."
1,This was the perfect chain for the Cute Twin Cats pendant I ordered. It was just perfect for the cat lover in our family. I am very satisfied and thinking of ordering the pendant and chain for myself.
1,"I was looking for a 30 inch narrow chain to use with a pendant I bought my Mom for Christmas. I had a lot of trouble finding one until I discovered this chain on Amazon. Not only was the chain very attractive and quite sparkly, but it seemed much more expensive than it was. It fit the bill perfectly for me. It was delivered in plenty of time for Christmas and my Mom was thrilled with it."
1,"This chain is awesome! The sparkle is brilliant and it looks like an expensive piece of jewelry. The clasp is small enough to fit even my smaller pendents and the 24"" slips over my head easily. You will not be dissapointed with this purchase."
1,"I bought this 14"" chain and a 14"" box chain and the snake chain is my favorite of the two. Both chains have a small end that you can put a smaller bailed pendant on them. High quality sterling silver at a great price. Makes a wonderful ""choker"" necklace of any pendant!"
1,"For the price, I was expecting something about as stiff and unyielding as one of those freebie chains that comes when one purchases a pendant. I was pleasantly surprised; this chain is soft but sturdy, nice sparkle, too. I've already given the seller a high rating, and I would not hesitate to purchase again in the future."
1,I just love Amazon. I have made many purchases and was totally satisfied with all of them.My latest purchased was just as I expected. Price was good as was the quality.
1,"Bought this as a gift for a family member. The chain was beautiful, but more importantly it was sturdy enough for the person we were buying for. Too many chains appear either too flimsy or too bulky. This was just what we wanted, strong but sleek. Again it has a beautiful appearance and is still strong enough for our needs."
1,This chain is exactly what I was looking for! Charms slide on and off easily and it does not tangle! I would recommend this product highly!
0,"I really liked it when I received it. However, after wearing it for a few days, the part of the chain that was closest to my neck discolored. I have never experienced that with other silver chains. I had diffulculty cleaning it with silver polish and that area is nowhere as shiny as the rest of the chain. I would not purchase this again."
1,I bought this as a replacement chain for a treasured necklace. It's actually better quality than the original and at a great price!
1,"I love the way this chain falls on the neck, beautiful fluid movement. Just the length I was looking for."
1,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I think it is very nice. I would do bussiness with them again. I give them an A++++++++++
1,"Sparkling Diamond Cut Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Snake Chain NecklaceI have , in the past, ordered various pieces of jewelry online. Some I have been pleased with, some were eh, acceptable, and some were just downright awful.BUT THIS ONE WAS PERFECT. I bought it for my daughter, who is so picky and hard to please, that I really had my doubts.She was thrilled and so was I.( I liked it so much, she almost didn't get it) So I think I'll order another one for myself.You can truly order this one with complete confidence."
1,"This chain looks absolutely adorable. Also, the seller shipped it amazingly fast. It was beautifully giftboxed. I will definitely buy from Gem Avenue again."
1,I am very pleased with the quality and appearance of this necklace. I do plan to purchase more as gifts.
1,The chain arrived quickly and it was better than anticipatedd. I weight it perfect but yet it is sturdy. Wonderful service.
0,"this chain it's too bad, the material it`s not good, is black in some places, very upset with this product. not recommend"
1,i ordered this item to display a seperate pendant and it just looks amazing. i highly recommend this item to anyone looking for a silver chain. the length was a little worrying at first but it turned out perfect. it looks exquisite and i am very satisfied.
1,"This necklace is so much better than I expected - I didn't expect it to be so shiny and sparkly and the chain is thicker than I thought it was going to be. Really good quality necklace, very good quality silver, great for the price! Even though the chain is a bit thicker than I thought it was going to be, the clasp is small enough so I can wear any of my pendants on this chain, even the tiniest ones, which is great - I've been disappointed so many times in the past, when necklases I'd ordered online had oversized clasps and I couldn't wear any of my pendants on them. But thankfully I didn't have such a problem with this one - the clasp is just right, and the necklace itself is the perfect width and at 20"" long it's the perfect lenghth. Great look and very good quality and for the price it's a steal!"
1,This chain exceeded my expectations. It feels really soft next to the skin and it looks like liquid silver. I purchased the longer length to hold a pendant and the two look fabulous together. I highly recommend this chain.
1,I was very pleased with the way this chain looked and was delighted to be able to give it as a gift. I was amazed that such a nice looking chain was so reasonably priced.
1,"I love this necklace because it is so sturdy. It is holding a very heavy pendant of mine, but it is strong enough to wear it everyday. I even wear it to go exercise!Also, I love the shine of this necklace. I have owned other silver chains to hold my pendant. This is a very shiny sparkling necklace. I highly recommend it!"
1,"I love this chain it is very sparkly. I ordered the size 24 inches and it's perfect it's not too big or small it fits beautifully. I get a bad reaction to anything with ""nickel"" in it and I assure you this has no nickel it is all sterling silver. I'm very happy with this purchase and with the seller gem avenue it also arrived before it's delivery date. Thank you amazon and gem avenue for awesome customer service!"
0,"When I bought the chain, i expected it to be a little thicker & longer but that is my fault. The chain did break at the female clasp end but the vendor quickly replaced with another one."
1,"I have recently developed an affinity for sterling silver but not all chains are created equal. These chains are sleek, shiny, and strong. They sparkle in all light and are the most beautiful chains I have ever purchased, and trust me I have purchased a lot. They are so beautiful that I purchased six total in different links and even doubled one over to make into a bracelet. Very impressed with quality and definitely the price."
1,"My wife and I purchased this same chain last year for a cross we gave to our oldest son on his confirmation. Now we bought one for our other son to wear with his cross. These chains are beautiful, durable (enough for teenage boys) and hold a brilliant shine. The product is well worth the cost (a low cost I might add) and service is excellent. GEM AVENUE offers great prices, quick delivery and outstanding values."
0,"This is a follow up to the very positive review I gave this necklace about 1 1/2 weeks ago. Well, this morning after a very easy turn of the chain to move the clasp to the back of my neck, the chain just snapped apart, not at the clasp but just in the middle of the chain, like someone had just cut it with scissors. It is a shame because it looks really nice but now I am out the money and no chain. Very disappointed. Had not had it even 2 weeks."
0,"The chain was purchased to replace a white gold chain that had stretched and broken. The chain was shipped quickly and appears as pictured. However, the chain caused a metal allergy severe enough that it can't be worn any longer. The recipient has several other solid silver chains which cause no problems at all; she also has a confirmed metal sensitivity to nickel. I'm not saying the chain is not silver (just suggesting) but there does seem to be something fishy when other solid silver chains cause no problems and this chain causes allergic reactions. The chain was cheap enough that I won't be returning it (return shipping would be too great a percentage of original purchase price) but I will be looking to buy a replacement chain from elsewhere and re-gifting this one."
1,"I ordered one for myself and one for my mother-in-law, and we were both very happy. The diamond cut makes it very sparkly and pretty. And it seems to be a nice-quality chain."
1,"This chain is beautiful. I highly recommend it. Shiny, sturdy, sparkling. Do not hesitate to order it for yourself."
1,"I originally had looked at and was going to purchase a more expensive item. I went with this because of the reviews and am very happy I did. I ordered 2 lengths and they are beautiful. Strong, shiny,and will be a compliment to any of my charms or pendants. Happily will order from this co. again."
1,"To hold this chain in your hand is like holding shining starlight. It's a tough chain, despite its delicate appearance, and this is the second one I've purchased. I will without doubt be buying another!"
0,Found black tarnish on the clasp and all over the chain right out the box. Seems to confirm the fact that this is not real .925 sterling silver.
1,"I am very happy with this chain (24"") and have just ordered a second one. I also bought the 30"". They are very sturdy chains, but aren't ""chunky"" and have lots of sparkle without overpowering the pendant on them. I've bought several silver chains, and these are just perfect! I would highly recommend them!!"
1,"This necklace chain is sturdy and shiny, but small enough to put my charm on. I do not see how it could bother your neck like the other reviewer said, but I don't wear my jewelry 24/7."
1,Good quality silver - Awesome finish - does not hurt and reall value for money. Glad I got it
1,"It is hard to buy jewelry on-line, but this is the best experience I've had. The price, the service and product are all of the highest quality one could possibly expect. The chain is a great quality, sturdy, sparkly, well made. I have several silver pendants that I would like to wear at different lengths depending on my clothing, so I will eventually buy all sizes."
1,This chain is great. I wear my necklaces 24/7 so I need my chain to be durable. I switch out several charm or pendants on my chains. This chain seems as though it will stand the wear and tear I will give it. It doesn't turn your neck green either. Sometimes inexpensive chains will do that.... not this one. Thanks for a great product and a great supplier.
1,This is a very nice chain for a great price. It looks much more expensive than it is - very shiny and has not tarnished like a lot of sterling silver jewelery tends to do over time.
1,Received the Sterling Silver Chain Necklace in pristine condition and in a timely manner. It was given as a Christmas gift and the receiver absolutely loved it. The necklace was of good quality Sterling Silver. I would absolutely order any other jewelry from this seller.
0,"This extender is a good product for the price. However, the links and clasp are very large compared to other chains I own and I couldn't use it on several of my necklaces because the clasp would not fit onto the smaller chains."
0,"looks fine, suit for young girls. The color and shape is satisfactory, but I am disappointed with it's small size."
0,"I ordered this as part of a birthday gift. Was disappointed when it arrived with one of the sapphire stones missing, so had to send it back for a replacement. It was also a smaller charm than I'd expected. The replacement arrived in good order and via overnight delivery. Amazon directed me to order that overnight service and promised reimbursement for that service, but I have yet to see reimbursement."
1,"After opening the teeny tiny pouch, emerged a teeny tiny turtle. Aside from not really paying attention to dimensions, I am really happy with this purchase. I am a turtle lover and collect them. I didn't do well converting the millimeters to inches and expected it to be a little larger. I do however have to say that this is a nice quality little gem.I don't need large always to be content with my choice."
1,My hunnnie Barbie loves turtles. Sapphires and sterling silver. She loves it. another home run for super hubby. Because I love her!
1,This was a beautiful charm and have received alot of compliments on it. It was exactly how it looked on the web.
0,was smaller then I expected and I thought it had a chain.Over all it looked nice I guess.I gave it to my youngest and She had a chain that She put it on
1,Purchased this for my best friend along with a sterling silver chain and she absolutely fell in love with it. The quality is that of which you find in the fine jewelry stores. It arrived before the due date and was packed nicely. Highly recommend.
0,"The turtle arrived without one of the stones on the back of the turtle. Tried to find it in the sack, but w/o success. As it was to be a gift to be presented next days, was very disappointed."
1,I purchased this necklace for my niece - and was blown away by how pretty it was!!! I am going to buy one for myself! It has beautiful color and can be worn around your neck or placed in a window as a sun catcher. The sun reflects off of it and sends rainbows everywhere! Just BEAUTIFUL!
1,Every single detail on this product is great. You really will love it. It is an amazing gift. Sincerely it is a high quality product.
1,"What a great necklace - I have problems picking out jewelry for my wife, but she loved this one. Shipping was great, the product was great - and I would buy from them again."
1,"I read the others reviews... The funny thing is that I originally bought this for my mom, but kept it for myself!! (I got her something else of course.) But, I just adore wearing it, and every time I have it on, someone compliments me on it and asks me wear I got it. It's the perfect necklace to wear with nothing else but a black tanktop and pants or skirt. Anyway, someone with blue or green eyes will love it."
1,"I was looking for a birthstone ring for myself. I only wear silver, and tend to a more 'bohemian' style, so everything else I'd seen was either too fancy, too cheap looking, or plain ugly. This ring was exactly what I'd been looking for"
0,"The ring was nice when I first bought it and it lasted a while, about 3-6 weeks back in 2007. I didn't think of updating this review to include that it shattered while I was grabbing onto a metal pole while on the bus and one of the pieces jammed into my finger, causing me to bleed. If this had been a major incident I would have been pushing a lawsuit for a faulty product. I wasted 10 dollars on this product and chalk it up to another faulty Internet product. Do NOT buy this product. Surf around and pick something else."
1,I was impressed when I received this bracelet. It is beautiful and looks genuine. It doesn't look cheap nor feels like plastic. The price is great as well. I have ordered several other pieces from silver speck and I am pleased and will continue to order from them.
1,"One thing that is not advertised is the size of this product. For those of you wondering the cross is about 3/4 in. long by 1/2 in. wide. To read the Lord's Prayer you need to put your eye really close to the stone in the middle. The version of the Lord's Prayer is the commonly known one based off of the King James Version. It ends with ""...but deliver us from evil. Amen."" (Excludes ""for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen."")Overall I think a nice religious product."
0,"The reason I wanted this, so you can see the Lord's prayer in the middle, you really cant see it that well. The necklace is pretty itself, but the whole idea I chose this was so you could see the Lord's prayer, would not recomment this to anyone."
0,"This pendant was accurately depicted both visually and in description, seemed well-constructed. Received as stated. More than I would normally pay as a wholesale buyer and jewelry creator. Overall, satisfied with this item."
1,I purchased this as a gift and am really hoping he is as pleased with it as I am. Love it!
1,"I've been wearing it as a necklace for months, can't even go out without hanging it in my neck. Looks gorgeous and reflects my style towards public."
1,"My husband is a Master Automotive Technician and he wanted something that would with stand the damage of his profession and this titanium ring does just that. After a while is does lose it's shine, but with a polishing rag the shine comes back. This ring is light weight, beautiful and you don't even know you have it on. Everyone that sees our rings are amazed at how pretty this ring is and wants to know where I got it at and I let them know where I got it at."
1,I really love this pendant! The chain is very nice quality and the pendant itself is the perfect size for what I was looking for. The stone has a very nice rich purple color and is very clear without inclusions. Very good buy.
1,"A dainty, classic design piece and I would have liked matching earrings. Good color but a bit on the small side."
1,"For what you are paying this bracelet is beautiful. This was my first jewelry item I got from Amazon, and I was not disappointed. The Sapphire stones are dark and sometimes easily mistaken for black stones, but either way the metal is sturdy and I've had this bracelet for the last 2 years. If your looking for a beautiful gift for a loved one, but don't have much to spend this is a perfect gift."
1,"I was so pleased when I received this in the mail. It was absolutely beautiful with nice weight. It was a gift for a family member, but I think I'll buy one for myself!"
1,"Beautiful bracelet!! Fair pricing and excellent service....I am truly enjoying wearing this lovely bracelet and have received numerous compliments on it, thank you!"
1,SHE LOVES IT! Bought it expecting the best and that's what i got. Thanks so much I've seen your other products and have some anniversary ideas!
1,"Love this necklace. It is actually shorter then I thought though, it also is less blingy too. None the less , it's beautifully on me and I recommend it to my friends who always ask about it ,"
1,"This pendant has a beautiful stone. It is a very rich swiss blue color. This stone has no hint of green. It's color is deep and saturated true blue. 2.25 carats makes it a really nice size solitare. The setting is simple sterling silver. The bail photographs more pronounced than it really is. The entire focus of this pendant is the stone, which is extremely clear, vibrant, and very well cut. I have received many compliments. Peora, the seller, also makes matching earrings. I purchased both pieces. It is a lovely set."
1,"After purchasing from Something Silver, I was pleasantly surprised when the order (which had been on sale) arrived three days early. The company was timely, helpful, and create outstanding products. I would recommend their products without hesitation."
0,Did not really like the design once I got it. It feels very flemsy. More suitable for a little girl
0,Although this is a cute bracelet it looks like a little kid made it. It is very cheaply made and it feels like I'm going to break it when i stretch it to put it on. Not very happy with this product!
1,My purchase's thru amazon have always been great. The charm was for my granddaughter and she is absolutely happy with it. Seeing her happy makes me even happier.
0,"Looks pretty in the picture and when received, but it is stiff and was not possible to position it so it didn't look twisted when being worn. Maybe I received something defective? I returned it."
1,"I was very satified with this merchandise. I purchased the item for the purpose that it was Breast cancer awarness month. I wore it while playing my softball games. What I liked about it was the quality of the wristband. It was comfortable, thick, well fitted, width was excellent and the price was hard to turn down. The opposing team complimented me on the wristbands and they stated that they look great. The funny thing my own teammates didn't say anything, but they were staring at them. I believe they were thinking to do the same.Thank you for your support."
0,It's a nice item but it didn't look like the pic. the words seemed thick and were painted outside the line.
0,"It looks nice online but in reality, it looks kinda of cheap. Only worth 50% or less of the amazon price."
1,Detail
1,"I am very pleased with both items I received from Nvie Designs. They arrived very quickly, were nicely packaged and were as advertised. I will order from this company again."
0,"Although the bracelet is embedded with glitter, the resin is a poor quality. It's a bit dull. Mine was very scatched when it arrived, and even has a small chip missing from the edge."
1,"these are good quality earrings with a solid clasp. I wear them all the time even in showers and sleeping and they are comfortable, lightweight, and secure."
1,My brother-in-law was just selected to serve as a court of appeals judge and we gave him these as a gift on the day of his investiture. He loved them and they did look stunning and very nicely packaged.
1,This was just what I was looking for. It arrived in a timely manner and was packaged well.
0,I have been looking for the lapis stone for years. I believe I am correct in saying that it is mined in only one country
0,The real color of this is not subtle shown in the picture. It is very plain light pink and almost clear. Even it looks like and feels like plastic.
1,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLERSUPER FAST SHIPPING!!!VERY WELL PACKAGED!!!!THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
1,"Great quality at a very competitive price. Platinum is expensive and this ring is not light, but is well worth it."
1,I bought this tongue ring for my husband. He love's his tongue ring. He wears it once in a while but not all the time. Looks great also.
0,"The anklet was nice, but my daughter wanted to return it. I never got an e-mail stating that it was returned, nor did I get it taken off my credit card as of yet."
1,"The photo does not come close to doing justice to this absolutely lovely, feminine, fine quality and sparkling pendant with a smooth and shiney box chain. The diamonds are gorgeous and pave set. Comes in a quality gift box too. I am very impressed with my purchase and the price is a real bargain!! Would make a fabulous gift for that special person in your life. You will be very happy with this great deal from Amazon!!"
0,Very disappointed. Coral came off the post and was lost. Waist of money
1,My brother in the coast guard loved this necklace!!!! Great price too- the cheapest I have found online but still great quality
0,"I received this bracelet for Christmas last year, and wore it constantly. It is small, but very pretty. A couple of weeks ago I noticed it was GONE from my wrist. I had not snagged it on anything, I don't do any physical activities, and I was SO SAD it was gone. I tried to contact Amazon with NO RETURNED PHONE CALLS! I believe the gold is so thin/chintzy that the bracelet simply won't last. I expect better quality for this money. I've had $50 bracelets last for YEARS with no problems at all.10k White Gold Diamond Heart Tennis Bracelet (1/2 cttw)"
0,"The product look great in the photo, but when it arrived I was sorely disappointed. It looked and felt cheap. Worst item I have received so far. Would love to return it but how?Fadora"
1,"This is a cool bracelet. It is very fexible so it will fit every wrist. Not super shiney, but that the nature of pewter. A good buy!"
1,GREAT NECKLACE IT HAS A NICE FINISH AND GREAT WEIGHT ON IT NOT TO HEAVY AND NOT TO LIGHT IT'S MY FAVORITE NECKLACE
1,I bought this necklace for my girlfriend and she wears it all the time. It is great and seems well made so far.
1,A High quality piece of jewelry. Gets all kinds stares and comments. I'd recommend this to any Satanist.
1,I am completely in love with this belly button ring. It looks just like the picture! It's super cute and the delivery was very quick! I will definitely buy from this company again!
1,This ring is beautiful for the money. It is large and the garnet is a deep wine color with a lot of sparkle to it. The picture does not show how refined the silver work is. It is wonderful quality for the money. I am so happy I ordered it.
0,so sad....after a very sloooow shipping process I was so happy to receive the ring....or so I thought. This ring is far more expensive than other silver rings I've bought from this seller but I thought the stone would make it worth it...WRONG! The stone is very large and fake/cheap looking and it was set like the leaning tower of pisa very crooked also the setting protrudes way off the ring adding to that cheap costume jewelry look you can't tell by the the picture WHAT A SHAME the tag said &#34;made in thailand&#34; they should have added &#34;with their feet&#34; A LONG WAIT FOR GARBAGE not to mention the size is wrong I compared it to other and its one size smaller?
1,"I've had a few tongue rings and this one, unlike alot, you don't have to keep tightening it. It stays tight. Looks great."
0,"I ordered this pendant about two weeks ago choosing free shipping. It arrived on Fri. Sept. 17th. The item was well packaged and the box was undamaged. As I opened the box I began to notice problems. The snake chain and pendant were in separate zip lock bags. When I opened the bag with the chain, a short length of very small jump rings fell on the floor. This was obviously an ""adjuster chain"" to vary the length of the snake chain. I carefully examined it and found no separations or broken links. So whoever packaged it just threw them in together. I then noticed that the snake chain had been crushed several inches from one end, causing an irreparable kink.I then examined the pendant itself. The setting was cast silver and the stone was not bezel set but rather cut to the size of the casting and glued in place (like an inlay). The stone had been poorly cut. leaving a gap at the top, and it had the lower left corner cut off, thus leaving another gap. The bale was crooked, listing about 10 degrees to the right. And finally, while the piece had been advertised as red tiger eye, it was not. It was common golden tiger eye with two tiny red stripes near the center. I'm not naive, I know that this is a factory piece and is at a low price point. I liked the overall design of the pendant and would have kept it as a gold tiger eye if there hadn't been so many quality problems. As a result, I returned it."
0,"This bracelet isn't what is shown in the picture. It is flat, and shinny, not as shown! You would think they could have used a better photo!"
1,"Beautiful, not as long as I expected to be, but my fault ... Fits perfect with my ring !!! Love it!"
1,Very Happy with the product and service that I receive from Amazon. Keep up the good work.
1,"This is a sweet deal for such a classic, understated look. I've found I can wear this necklace with just about anything, and it looks natural both out on the town and in the conservative environment where I work. Out of three inexpensive necklaces I purchased months ago, this is the only one that could take the punishment I inflict on jewelry. And you usually get a 16&quot; chain at this price, but I really appreciate the versatility I get from the extra 2&quot;. If I have more cash to spend someday, I may trade up to a bigger sized pearl pendant. Right now, I'm just pleased as punch to have a piece that's beyond reproach."
1,"These are genuine Akoyas and they're beautiful. They have a nice, shiny luster. I ordered 4 pairs at this price to give as gifts for Christmas this year. They're all in the 7 to 7.5 mm range. The color is slightly different from pair to pair (some whiter, some pinker), but the earrings for each set match perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase and will buy more sets because they're the perfect, have-on-hand gift for birthdays, too!"
1,if you are a small woman such as myself you will love this bracelet. very delicate and feminine. i just love it. goes perfect with all my gold jewelry too.
1,"My fiance` loved this ring and wears it proudly and shows it off daily.She was brought to tears by how beautiful it is.When it becomes available again guys and you have special lady in your life,get this ring or one simular to it and she will love you for it."
1,"Soda lite is such a beautiful stone! With all of the natural variations, each stone is unique. These earrings go great with almost anything. An awesome deal for the money!"
1,I bought this to complement another bangle bracelet and it is perfect. It looks pretty and classic. Great buy.
1,"I got this cleaner to clean my diamond engagement ring, which had one of the small diamonds replaced a few months ago. At the time the stone was replaced, the ring was cleaned at the jeweler's and I was astonished at how much more it sparkled than it had when I brought it in. Anyway, fast forward 4 months, and the ring is looking less impressive, but to top it off, the new stone is looking nearly an opaque white. I abuse this ring by wearing it almost constantly regardless of what I'm doing, so I wanted to give the whole thing a good cleaning before accusing them of replacing the missing diamond with something other than a diamond.After seeing the good reviews here and elsewhere, I selected this unit. I've seen lots of places recommend cleaning jewelry with nothing more than plain water when using an ultrasonic cleaner, and that is what I did. Boy, was I disappointed! It did look cleaner overall, but even after 2 3-minute cycles, it still didn't really sparkle, and the replaced stone still looked different from the rest. Also, looking closely at the underside of the settings, I could see there was definitely dirt in the crevices.So, I tried again, this time with a small squirt of dishwashing liquid in the water, and another cycle with clear tap water afterwards. Now, that's more like it! Even with the ring still under water, I could see the difference. All of the stones are sparkling, now.The unit is as simple as pie to operate, and seems well enough constructed. It has a stainless steel tank, and a plastic basket to protect your valuables from banging against the metal during cleaning. You can watch through a clear plastic window in the lid and see your rings vibrating - pretty cool.Any way, I'm happy with my purchase.Rebeccah"
1,"I have had this unit for only a short time, but it has worked as advertised. It thoroughly cleaned the jewelry I placed in it, although it took several repeat cycles to clean dirty watch bands. I have not yet tried the heating feature. The unit itself is large but appears to be very solid. I previously used an ultrasonic cleaner from another manufacturer, which broke down after a year or so, and I would expect this unit to last a much longer time."
1,"first off, i love this cleaner. i have cleaned some jewerly, and it worked great (water and windex)...do your polishing, clean it up best you can, then use this....it gets stuff out of those little places you can't get to. but what really got me was it's place in my garage. i used it, to great success, to clean fuel injectors....and it worked great. now my set up was complex (wave gens, reverse flow)but the ultrasonic bath worked fantasticly...but heed the warning...don't put sun-glasses or anything delicate in there...it is powerful and will eat it up....proof that it works...."
1,"Used this sonic cleaner to get years of grime out of padlocks, locks and cores. Works great! Heat feature really speeds up the process."
1,I use this for cleaning rifle brass mostly. The wife also cleans her jewelry in it. Does a pretty good job of getting things cleaned.
1,I had a great prompt service. Charm was beautiful and made a 15 year old band student very happy. She has not taken it off since she received it.Thanks.
1,"I bought this bracelet so I could make a charm bracelet for a friend and it was perfect- the links are just the right size and it is very sturdy. The clasp might be a little difficult for somebody to put on themselves, but I suppose that is always the case. Recommend this product."
1,"I was very pleased that the bracelet was exactly what was represented to me, and the ease of the purchase..."
0,"The order arrived 3 days later than the latest delivery estimate. The Pearls themselves are small and dull, and both the bracelet and the necklace are small and fragile. They don't even come in a nice box or any box at all for that matter. I would not buy this set from this seller again. I am currently trying to decide whether I will even give this as a gift at all (as it might make me look really chintzy just like the pearls) or should just send it back for a refund (unfortunately it is mere days till xmas so I think I might be stuck)."
1,"I was very happy about the quality of the pendant and necklace. Mostly, I am surprised at the speed in which I received the pendant and necklace! I received in 4 days including a weekend! I will buy from Silver Insanity again!"
1,"These are for my daughter. She is a freak about elephants. They are tiny, but very nice looking and perfect for a 12 yr old."
1,"These are cute little raised .925 silver earrings, which face each other (perfect). The detail on one trunk is a little warped, but otherwise, these are exactly what I wanted."
1,I bought this bracelet about a year ago and had been wearing it for weeks without taking it off. I noticed this past weekend that it wasn't on my ankle anymore. I'm SOOOOOOO disappointed that I lost it. It was exactly the right length and complimented another one that I wear so well. I'm ordering another one today!!
1,Nice quality. Price was fantastic buy. Did not expect much for that price but was pleasantly surprised. Have been wearing it several weeks now with no problems. Thanks!LaDonna Schukei
1,"i am stunned at how nice this bracelet is, it was a bargin at this price, diamond cut and sparkles, shines, very nice, if you are looking for a bracelet with some width to it, this is not it, however it seems to be a very sturdy, well made item good for if you just want a bit of sparkly jewelry around your ankle.i am happy with it, enough to check out other items this vendor is selling........"
1,I recently purchased this anklet based on other reviews and the price. I was not disappointed. The anklet is very well made. The design is unusual and very pretty. I liked it so much I am now ordering the necklace and bracelet to match.
0,"I guess I should've known better for the price, $6 i think for a sterling silver ankle bracelet... not good. I shouldve waited and spent the extra money for something good. The seller was great and everything came fast and whatnot but i KID YOU NOT, this bracelet turning my skin BLACK! The bracelet so far maintained its color and still looks pretty but it turned my foot BLACK. My cousin told me to throw it away before my foot falls off! No bueno."
1,"Like many reviewers, I've gone through many anklets. At least a few each summer. Why you ask? I never take it off. I'm too lazy to be the type of person that removes all jewelry everyday. I've had it a few months and I have not taken it off. Literally. I wear it to sleep, under socks with tennis shoes, while swimming, showers, etc etc. This is the first anklet I have ever had that has not broken. It also looks amazing; its very thin but noticeable. I recommend this to anyone that wants an anklet; its truly worth every penny."
1,The anklet was too big when I first received it. So I sent it back and another was promptly sent out to me. I was really impressed with the quick response! Thanks!
1,"I bought a 10-inch anklet and it is wonderful. I am very happy with my purchase. It is delicate, yet not flimsy. The singapore chain sparkles nicely. The 10-inch is a perfect fit for me, and falls nicely below the ankle bone. There is no discomfort when I walk. (The anklet is best worn without socks or shoes, as that may be uncomfortable.) I haven't had this for long enough to see whether it tarnishes, but all silver does eventually. This can be dealt with by cleaning with a special polishing cloth, or using a jewelry cleaning liquid, so I'm not worried about this potential problem.Delivery was speedy, and I would definitely recommend this product."
1,I just got it today! It's super cute. I love it. It fits perfectly around my ankle. I got the 9 inch one. My ankle isn't that big because I'm small (5 feet tall). I want to wear this forever! It makes my feet feel so cute and pretty. I hope it never breaks because I want to wear it always!
1,This is the cutest silver anklet I've ever owned. The 9 inch chain fits me perfectly and it also looks great. I am impressed!
1,"Inexpensive, arrived on time and what I wanted. I would suggest measuring your ankle to get the right size, luckily I guessed correctly."
1,I bought this charm for myself when I graduated from college. It is very pretty and well made.I received it promptly and I am very happy with my purchase.
1,"I am fully happy with my purchase of these lovely black onyx earring. They actually are lighter than I thought they would be, which is GREAT! I have received alot of compliments on these earrings. I love them!"
1,"I liked the wing type look of this pendant, as it's different from other celtic pendants I've seen over the years. I wear it from time to time and almost always have someone remark that it's pretty or unusual or ask me what it's supposed to be. The workmanship, and quality of crystal and sterling are worth the money."
1,"This was a gift from my son to me. He e-mailed me a gift certificate, so I picked out my own present. Peridot is my birthstone. I am very happy with the quality of the stones and the necklace."
1,I am extremely satisfy with this product. I have to say that it was beyond my expectation. The color is same as pictured and the necklace is very delicate. The workmanship is phenomenal. I am planning on buying one for my mother and sister.
0,"However,the're was a stripped screw so that the dice on top would fall off every secound!I tried everything to fix it but couldn't.I'm going to try another bio plastic belly button ring and see what happens.Hopefully I won't get a stripped screw!Oh this belly button ring is super super small size of my pinky finger but I liked that part!"
1,"This is a very beautiful ring. It arrived in a ring box in perfect shape, and it looks just like the picture online. The stone color is pretty light for a blue topaz, more like an aquamarine but still very lovely. I love the asymmetric design and the delicate detail. A great ring for everyday wear!"
1,"Do not judge these earrings by the price, they are so beautiful and bold, yet very comfortable on the ear, I absolutely love them and was stunned at the price, they are also very shiny and lots of filigree, I would have bought more colors if offered. Silver Insanity is great, lots of unique items, great service and the best prices...see for yourself!"
1,"Don't pay retail for this. But at $70 the value is there. The bracelet looks nice. The diamonds are a good size, white, and sparkly but are heavily included."
1,"AS A PURCHASER OF NATIVE AMERICAN ART WORK, JEWELRY AND CRAFTS THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PIECE FOR THE PRICE."
1,"It's durable, good quality, intricate, & dazzling. It's smaller than I expected, but way better quality than I expected. I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
1,"My wife has a lot of earings. She likes them to be highly visible and easily accessible. This is the 4th earring display holder we have purchased, all identical items. They are small emough to easily fit on top of the dresser. My wife is very pleased with the look, functionality, quality and size."
1,"I just love this stand, its the perfect addition on the dresser to keep all the earrings and sometimes even dangle bracelets on it. Keeps them easily accesabile and helps me decide what i want to wear quickly :)"
1,I bought this for my wife because I was tired of untangling her earings and necklaces. It saves me tme from trying to untangle her jewlrey.
1,"I owne a lot of earrings and love to wear them every day, so this is just the perfect way to have them organised, and makes it very easy to choose from. It is big enough but not too much, and quite pretty looking. I had been looking for something like that for a long time and just absolutely love it and recommend it!"
0,"the product arrived and the bottom ring was broken or bent. the columns are too close together and doesn't give adequate room in between for long earrings. It is great if you have a lot of small, short length earrings. allows for lots of them to be placed on the rack."
1,Very handy!!! All my earrings and bracelets are displayed so I can SEE what I have. Reasonably priced. Bought one for my silver and one for my gold.
1,Great for earrings! I also out my necklaces on the side hooks which is an added bonus. Dangly earring can take a couple of rows but I just make them overlap.
1,If you have a lot of small earrings this is perfect! It was money well spent. I have nothing negative to say about this earring rack!!
1,"An earring holder is an earring holder, for the most part, though I bought this one, because earrings are all the jewelry I wear, so I needed a holder that did not also have places for rings or necklaces or anything of that sort. My favorite thing about this product is that on either end of it, I can use the curled pieces to hang my big hoops from."
1,"I wasn't sure how sturdy this earring rack would hold up to my numerous earring collections, but it did its job perfect! I absolutely love it and am so glad I purchased 4 of these. The display looks very nice & trendy and it's much easier to pick out my pair of earrings with just a glance from the rack. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,This has to be my best purchase from Amazon! period!And they look so pretty with all my earrings on it that I don't even want to remove them to wear :D jokes apart.. very practical and quite elegant.. Love it. Going to order 2 more for my friends
1,"what a find! I had wondered for so long how I can organize my earrings in a way more suitable then previous (jewlry trays). I was almost dumping everything on the counter to find the matching pair. I looked at some seemingly ingenious fabric holding that were quite contemporary and different. But, in the end, they looked cheap although they were around $50.00. Also, dust would become a problem over time. Anyway, I absolutely love this black metal stand which I keep on a tall dresser. Looks great. The height reduces space, yet allows for such great organization. I SIMPLY LOVE IT! The fact that it will hold bracelets, necklaces or a watch on either side is just a bonus.jan 2012 update. Still going strong over 2 years later. The price has gone down since then too and it was a bargain back in 2010. I recently purchased one for a friend who spoke its accolades too. Organizing is such a great thing."
1,I just got this today and I'm already over the moon about it. It's a lot bigger than I was expecting and it looks really well made. I'm addicted to earrings and needed something better than a box to organize them. This is EXACTLY what I was looking for.
1,"This is a great product. There's plenty of space for earrings. My only issue is with the curly ends for necklaces. They get easily tangled if you put a lot of them on there. Otherwise, I really love this sturdy holder and hope to use it for a long time to come since it's so well-made."
1,"So far so good!! After searching through the different items available on amazon, I decided to go with this one because of its reviews. I was not disappointed. The quality is good. It has lots of room for many pairs of earrings, such that after I received this product, I wanted to go buy a lot more pairs of earrings to fill it up."
1,"I have several of these earring holders. They hold a lot of earrings, they are sturdy, and (best of all--for me) they have a music motif. (I collect music ""stuff""). And they are great if you have larger/longer earrings that are hard to put on ""standard"" holders."
1,this product is very pretty and very useful too. It arrived quickly and I'm very pleased with it.
1,"I first got this a few months ago and I loved it- ordered two more (different seller) and it was HORRIBLE QUALITY! I originally bought from sunrise which when i went in my order history, it is now called dazzaling gifts - their product is great quality - Zoohu was HORRIBLE (chipped, etc) and MyGifts was a peice of junk and not even the right color - glazed over and not solid.Amazon should be more careful who they let sell since some have some really cheap knockoffs."
1,This product is exactly the way it looks in the photo. It's perfect. I finally have a place for all of my earrings.
1,it was a gift for my gf and she loves it. i also no longer have to worry about earrings littering every coffee table in the house
1,"I've had other earring trees, and always ended up over-crowding them and creating a mess. This has tons of room (especially if you use one hole per pair), and everything stays neat and untangled."
1,This earring rack is bigger than I expected it to be and it totally awesome! The side hooks are great for bracelets and necklaces and there is tons of space for MANY earrings. Exactly what I was expecting!
1,I Love these!........I've bought several!.....BLACK metal JEWELRY harp Earring RACK stand HOLDER....they hold a lot they're well made and makes it easy to store and find things!~
1,"I am so pleased with this earring holder! I can put both wires and posts on it, see where they are and better make a decision about which ones I want to wear."
1,These earring holders are great for my show displays. Holds lots of earrings while easy to view. They're just what I needed.
1,I looked all over the web for something to store my earrings and of course I should know to rely on Amazon. This got so many good reviews and I have to agree with everyone. I really love this. It's perfect for me to see my earrings. I had way more than I thought I did so I'm thinking I need to buy another one. Very easy and perfect for my needs.
1,"At first I was worried that there wasn't enough space, but I put my studs on the top rows and the longer ones toward the bottom. I am amazed at how many pairs of earrings I have fit on here. They are also displayed so well that it makes choosing my pair of earrings fast, I don't have to rifle through anything. I even use the little hooks on either side to put a few necklaces on, it kinda doubles as an earring and necklace holder."
1,"Mine arrived in perfect shape, though I can see why it's vulnerable in transit. I ordered it with a book, which came in the same box. I think this helped holding the harp stand in place and offered some protection in transit - for your consideration.I've had it for over a week and have not noticed any silver tarnishing problem (reported on some other similar products).Now just need to buy more earrings to fill up the gaps. :P"
1,"Expectations exceeded. I bought this ring expecting it to be ""okay"" (b/c its bioplast) but it turned out to be fantastic. Its true to the color in the picture, super comfortable and awesome for the price. I loved it so much that I decided to purchase the purple-pink marracas belly ring. It was also beautiful. Will continue to buy belly rings from this company. Excellent quality!"
0,The ring is very cool. But the silver design surrounding the stone distracts from the jade and elephane. The size runs big. I wear a size 6 and it fits like a 7. For the price I am not returning it to get a new one. But it would've been nice if it had fit better.
1,It was given as a gift for my wife and she loved it. You can purchase pearls but Black pearls WOW.
0,"Having purchased many pearls over the years, I'm well acquainted with inexpensive pearls, freshwater pearls, and pearls that are suitable to give as gifts. These pearls are definitely not suitable to give as gifts, unless your recipient is EASILY impressed. Most of the pearls on the string were badly misshapen. They looked like two half-pearls squashed together. They just weren't nice at all.The good things were the color and the packaging. The packaging was stellar. The pearls were not, alas. I'm stuck with these because there's no way I can give them as a gift, and I misplaced the receipt so I can't return them.If you want a better option, look forPearl Freshwater Cultured Pink Tones Necklace Strand 7.5-8mm 18"" Heart Clasp Bucasi-- which were cheaper than the PearlsOnly pearls and considerably more beautiful. There were no double pearls in my strand, the pearls were very symmetrical (for freshwater pearls, anyway!), and the colors were lovely. The clasp was stunning, too. The only thing lacking in the Bucasi pearls was a nice box. Heck, for this quality of pearl I'll provide my own box."
1,"I'm using this for an initial piercing and it was easy (relatively, lol) to put in. I love it and you can tell when you need to clean it because it's clear. I love it :)"
0,"The pendant was smaller than I expected, even based on the dimensions given - maybe I just couldn't picture the size. The blue topaz stone was a little light in color. I ordered this with a pair of blue topaz earrings which I didn't keep, so I really didn't need to keep the pendant. I returned the items together for a refund and was very pleased at the speed at which I got the refund. I was also pleased at the speed of delivery of the items."
0,"The stone is pretty, but the whole piece seems too lightweight... cheap. When you hold it in your hands it doesn't have any weight to it. It doesn't look like an expensive piece of jewelry."
1,"I ordered this pendant along with a heart-shaped blue topaz ring for a total of CAD. 22, including the s/h fee. The actual item that I have just received is identical to the one shown in the photo. The center stone is pretty. The blue colour is authentic. The chain that came with the pendant is surprisingly nice. I think the chain alone would have been around CAD. 12 to 15 (before tax) in Sears or the Bay. This item is a great buy."
1,"THE PICTURE DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THIS BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE. IF YOU LIKE LAPIS YOU WILL WANT THIS PIECE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.I NOW HAVE THE NECKLACE , BRACELET AND EARRINGS."
1,"Beautiful necklace! Prettier than the picture! Great customer service as well. I emailed them, and responded within 4 hours--even on a Sunday! Perfect gift!"
1,The photo of this locket does not show its true beauty!! What a surprise to see the sparkling clear sets that adorn the front of the locket along with the amethyst sets! I was originally drawn to its antique and dainty appearance and its unique shape and design. It is truly an elegant piece of jewelry - no one will believe it was inexpensive!! Great buy for the price and a terrific addition to your jewelry wardrobe!
1,"I purchased this for my wife, and she loves it. I did alot of research on options for a heart necklace before I purchased this necklace. Amazon sells one that's 1/4ctw and 1/2ctw. I selected this one (1/2ctw) because I felt it would look nicer, and it looks great. The diamonds are the right size, and so is the heart. In the light, it shines nicely. As far as the grade of the diamonds, due to their size, you really cannot see any issues with any of the diamonds.The only thing that Amazon should change would be that they should put a better clasp on the necklace. This version is a very basic clasp. Most other necklaces that my wife has have better clasps."
0,The stud was as described. The backs were so tiny I could hardly hold them to put them on and then the first time I wore them one of the backs came off and was lost.Sybil
1,"yhis item i purchase for my mother in law, i hope is happy with this . is very fine and have a good quality"
1,This is a very cute little butterfly necklace. Good value for the price. Great service by Eve's Addiction.
1,love the case and it fits my cards perfectly :)) def a good buy and a good gift :)) :))
1,"I ordered this charm on 01-24-07, in the evening. I received it, via USPS, 01-17-07. It was shipped in a protective, padded envelope. Within was a plastic bag with a silver cardboard box, the charm and chain, both of sterling silver. The Golden Retriever charm and the lovely chain are gorgeous. This is the first Golden Retriever charm I have seen that is beautifully made and reasonably priced.Sabrina's Silver has many more delightful dog charms. Well worth a look!"
1,"My daughter received this necklace as a Christmas gift and it is so great. It is something you could wear everyday, strong enough to hold up but dainty enough for a teen. A wonderful, thoughtful present! I plan to purchase these for gifts in the future."
1,My little brother gifted me with the Amazon gift card and I bought the necklace I have always wanted and luckily found on your website. THANK YOU so much Amazon for having what I wanted.My only concern was that the box was open next to my mail box and should not have been placed on the ground next to the mailboxes (4).A very satisfied with my necklace and wear it proudly.Marialia Cruz
1,I wear the medal everyday. Had to put it on a new chain as the chain it came with was a metal that made me break out. Other than that the medal itself it great. Looks just as described.
1,I have just received my ring. I love it! It's absolutely gorgeous. The stones are bright and tiny but very delicate. If you like big stones this ring it's not for you. But if you are looking for a special one this is for you. I recommend it.
1,"This is an absolutely beautiful high quality ring that can be worn with almost any color outfit. I can't believe that this ring only cost me $35 because it looks expensive with the high quality gemstones and little diamonds. The surprise is that it is high quality and I have worn it for over a year and it still looks like new. I am hard to fit in rings since my fingers are long and skinny, but this ring fits perfect and is not overwhelming. My best friend loved it and couldn't believe how much I paid and then proceeded to buy one of her own. If you wear this ring, I guarantee it will get noticed."
1,It's a beautiful ring; it matches anything I wear. I've received several compliments on it. I love it!
1,"I ordered my ring on the 19th and it was scheduled to come on the 25th. A little long, but I could deal with that. Instead, I got it today, on the 22nd! Anyways, the ring is exactly what I expected, and I love it. It's sturdy and doesn't feel cheap at all. The stones are absolutely beautiful. Do I love it? Yes!"
0,"I ordered this for my 3 yr old son who loves his cousin's musical box. There arent very many out there for boys! He was so happy when he opened it.....but within a few hours, we discovered that the actual music piece was not even secured to the box at all, and the little spinning doggie kept getting stuck on the platform. My little boy never even wound it up...only mommy and daddy. This box is very flimsy and there are pieces inside that look like they should be glued down, but arent. What a difference in the quality of the disney boxes as compared to this one! My husband is going to try to fix it....who knows! If I knew....I would never have spent this kind of money on it!"
0,"Unfortunately, I agree with the other reviewers who have said these pearls are not nearly as pink as the picture makes them seem. They're more of a grayish pink - think storm clouds at sunset. On the plus side, they have a beautiful lustre. Another reviewer stated that she bought these earrings as a gift for her little girl. Though the pearls are small, they could be worn by an adult. In sum, they are lovely earrings as long as you don't expect them to be truly pink. I paid $13.19 on sale for mine and will keep them and wear them."
1,"I love this necklace. It is great for St. Patty's day and any day you feel like you need a little extra luck. It is delicate, simple, and pretty. I have received several comments ^_^."
1,"I ordered this charm with a worry in the back of my mind that once it arrived, it would be smaller than listed on the site or made of cheap material- once I opened the box I knew I was worrying over nothing. The charm is large enough that the etching details are clear and the silver is quality. I will definitely buy from Sabrina Silver."
1,"Bought these as a gift for someone else and ended up keeping them. They're small, so I haven't taken them off since first putting them on a couple of weeks ago. Comfortable, light, I even sleep in them. They look great."
0,"I read both reviews and thought the price was way too good to resist and I am looking for interesting and shippable items for my family overseas. It is definitely what I expected, no I was not expecting pearls, it does not pretend to be that. But I did not expect to take them out of the sack and find that some of the 'pearls' had already broken off.Mind you I can wear it, but I would hate to ship this to my sister as her gift and find that she opens it to see more 'pearls' broken off. I am not recommending that anyone buy this, although it does look 'pretty'. It is not even durable enough to survive as cheap costume stuff.Well I am off to locate a decent gift for my sister who certainly deserves more than this."
0,"This is kind of a nice necklace. The problem is that the quality of the pearls isn't the same as pictured (even when you spot the flaws). For instance, the one I purchased has several misshapened pearls. They looked like big, flat molars. I couldn't get over this and had to return this item."
0,"The price I paid was great for what I hoped I was getting. When the necklace arrived the fresh water pearls were so ugly, they were much larger then the picture showed and they had pointed ends....very weird shaped. I have never worn the necklace, it will remain in the box until my little girl wants to wear some play jewelry."
1,Great for trying on clothes with less grab and perfect shape for easily slip inside the hole. I used it to hide it from a friend i had yet to tell about the piercing. He's not crazy about that stuff.
0,"Don't bother!! What a disappointment!! They were bought for a gift for someone who loves mice, she hasn't worn them yet. She couldn't even figure out what they were."
0,"A bit smaller than I thought it would be....and the silver wire seemed very fragile, but my daughter loved it."
0,"The cross is very small, and is not as pretty and detailed as it appears in the photo. With this said, after seeing the cross I decided it would be better suited for a younger person and decided to give it to my 15 year old niece and she really seemed to like it. Overall, for the price, I am not too disappointed."
0,"Be aware that the finish, which says glossy is in fact very high gloss. Very Very high shine. I would not have ordered it if the picture had been accurate. It looks like a lovely, flat finish mahogany but looks almost like plastic. However, it is very nicely finished inside with lots of room; so if you don't care what it looks like on your dresser, go ahead and get it."
0,The item is realy nice but the size is very smallBut still nice itemThanks
0,"I just loved this adorable bejewled butterfly toe ring when I saw it online! I'll confess that I wondered how many times I could wear it before one of the little ""blue crystals"" would fall off, but I did NOT expect it to ARRIVE with only 3 of the 4 small sparklies intact. There's a lot of cute, very inexpensive costume-jewelry out there. This, unfortunately, not only looks cheap, but is made with substandard materials."
1,"Absolutely LOVE this pendant. It still shines and sparkles, is elegant and the quality is excellent. Highly recommend to everyone."
1,I ended up getting this in lavender because the white was out of stock. It's lovely and groovy. I know I'll wear it a lot.Very pleased with the service and the packaging.
1,I bought this as a lightening deal and couldn't be happier with it. I haven't worn a drop necklace before and it's a fun piece. You definitely know that you have a necklace on as there is a bit of weight to it but it's not cumbersome. The circular pieces are about the size of a 5m pearls and separated evenly by small silver balls. The silver with black swirls make it versatile to wear with just about everything. I like the hint of peridot-it's just enough to tease but not overwhelm. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
1,"I bought this item as a gift and I am sure that the person receiving it will love it! These earrings are just the right size, and I really like the fact that they are sterling silver. The horses have very nice and delicate detail on the head, mane and tail, which makes the earrings look realistic. I am very glad I found these horse earrings!"
1,These were ordered for a young girl who loves horses. The earrings were well made and crafted wonderfully. I am very pleased with the earrings and the matching necklace.
1,"I worked for nine years at an upscale jewelry store that sold Zina jewelry, and I can attest it is quality merchandise. Rarely did we get returns when someone had received a Zina piece as a gift. Even more rarely did we have to return anything for repair as the pieces are of very high quality. Even more incredible was that Zina would remake a missing earring. I lost one at a football game, mailed in the ""partner,"" and got a brand-new, hand-created replacement. To find Zina jewelry on Amazon at such good prices was a thrill for me. I have already bought at least four items on Amazon to date."
0,My family detests this loaf of crap. my sister got this about four years ago and it drived us nuts! We would find beads all over our house and the bracletcs woulden't stay together. it was a nightmare. don't by your child or yourself this intoxicating junk! you stink natural sience ind ltd! your geneticly modified sience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you ruind our lifes and our house! screw you!
1,Love these earrings. I purchased for granddaughter and she loves them. I am going to buy myself a pair. Just the right size for a 13 year old girl.
0,These are beautiful earrings but tooooooooooo big for my earrings. I like Zina Sterling Silver and am having a better fit with the medium size hooped earrings. I sent these back for a refund but have not received the refund as yet.
1,"These are great! I like the color and especially the price!!! At first I thought they would be to small and I would have to give them to one of my nieces, but they open up and slip on your ear and magnificent fit! I will have to order my nieces their own in their birthstone color. This is a sturdy piece of sterling silver and I like it. I will order more from this company and go through Amazon.com to do it! Thanks to you both for a very good quality product."
1,Received the scarab and haven't had it off my charm holder since. I purchased one in Egypt for my daughter in law and then discovered when I got back that I wanted one for myself. Amazon made it easy.
1,"I have to say, that I was very impressed not only with the product I received, but with the shipping timeline and also with the way the product was sent. This was exactly as I'd pictured it on Amazon.com, and delivery was much sooner than I'd expected. Delivery was expected to be between 12/18-12/26, and I received the product on 12/20, which was before Christmas. It was nicely and securely packaged, and the product lived up to my expectations. I would DEFINITELY buy from this vendor again, and I was very satisfied with my overall experience with them!"
0,I bought these as a gift for someone so I don't really have much of an idea of how it turned out except that she says she really liked them and goes great with a good many of her dresses.
1,"My best friend wanted me to find a pair of silver earrings for her that she purchased in Maine 2 years ago. Well, they match perfectly! I am so glad that we have the right pictures on Amazon. That is how I matched them,with a picture. Thank you Amazon."
1,"A very fine web site, and plan to use your web site in the near future"
0,"I had looked at quite a few of Silver Insanity's rings before purchasing this one. The service was great(fast shipping, arrived in a black velvet bag), and the ring is sized perfectly, but it is too delicate for me. I read the specs before buying, but the rose is a bit on the small side. Good for those with skinny fingers; good for those who wear a size 5 and under. The way it is designed also makes one side of the leaves behind the rose thicker than the side. It's a bummer, as I was really excited about getting this, but it just isn't up to my expectations."
1,"I got this for my gf,juz to promise her that I love her and only her,she loved it. I gave it to her while we was in Orlando, after she was hinting that she wanted a ring, she didnt know I was going to give her one. But the ring is small and shiny, and it fit perfect on her finger. I suggest that anyone and everyone get this ring for their love &lt;3"
1,I loved the prompt delivery. I have gotten many compliments on the ring I ordered and I am quite pleased with the quality. The size was very accurate and fits me perfectly. I have no complaints!
1,"I got these beautiful rings because I wanted to surprise my 3 1/2 year old with a big girl ring without having to spend a lot of money (since she is 3 1/2). I got one for her and one for myself and they are soo beautiful, great shape, pretty little rings and she loved it!! It came fast and I'm so happy with the whole experience!! Definitely recommend especially for your daughters :) Gorgeous little rings :)"
1,"This was a Valentine gift for one of my daughters. I paired it with the matching rosebud earrings. I guessed 2 sizes smaller for a pinky ring (sz 4) and it was perfect. These are sterling silver, and the matching earrings are too, which made an excellent buy!"
1,I was surprise how detailed this Rose Flower ring was. From a distance and up close you can tell it's a beautiful rose flower ring. My wife loves it. Many compliments. Doesn't look cheap.
1,"I was amazed at how quickly I received the ring! I think it is higher quality than what the picture shows, and is very delicate and feminine. The ring size is a little bigger than I expected, but not enough to be a problem. Thank you Silver Insanity! I will be ordering from you again in the future."
1,"I was hoping to get another one, as my wife really loved it (before my one year old ripped it off her neck). Oh well."
1,"This charm is so cute. I think it is perfectly sized to fit on the charm. I saw something similar to this on a different site, but this one was cuter and the other one was much more expensive."
0,"These really let me down. Just so people know...they are actually black (not like natural black pearls). They are dyed. So, if you were hoping they'd be dark grey with purple like real black pearls, you're out of luck. If you want BLACK pearls then by all means pick these up. However, they were great about accepting my return."
0,"not so sure it does. i think i might have seen it kinda glowing. very cute, if your into pink :)"
0,"This unit is very heavy. Two people are required for installation. Plus, the installation with three anchors placed in inconvenient locations is not practical and does not add any strength to hold it on the wall. I would never have purchased this if I had known how difficult it is to install. I would purchase the lighter ones that give you the flexibility of hanging over the door as well as the wall."
1,I love love love this mirror! Great quality and looks so nice on the wall. Best of all it holds all my jewelry and keeps it well organized. It is very heavy so we took the advice of some of the previous reviews and used additional anchors when hanging so there is no chance of it falling off the wall. I can't believe how great it looks.
1,"Very pleased with this necklace. It lends itself well to many occasions. I have worn this with nice top for work or out around town on the weekends. Matches quite nicely with the earrings [Sterling Silver, Freshwater Cultured Pearl and Cubic Zirconia Earrings] and also matches the drop pendent necklace [Sterling Silver 7x9mm Pear-Shaped Freshwater Cultured Pearl w/ 6mm Round Brilliant-Cut Cubic Zirconia Pendant, 18""]. Be aware that the blue crystals are very light in color and that the necklace mixes blue and clear crystals together. All together this is a very pretty necklace and I am happy with my purchase."
0,"The earrings are lovely. The only problem I have had is the butterfly clasps that came with the earrings. The first time I wore them one of the earrings fell out! I did notice the clasp was loose when I put the earrings on, but I didn't expect it to fall off. Luckily I realized the loss before leaving the house and found the earring. I'd hate to lose the lovely anniversary gift my husband surprised me with."
1,"This is a beautiful, substantial ring - it looks way more expensive than it is."
1,I graduated from university nearly thirty years ago. I have just started my first charm bracelet and wanted to commemorate my university experience. This is a quality charm with a pearl and a little moveable tassle.
1,These are very beautiful earings that can be used while wearing anything. I am very pleased with them.
0,Very pretty but the stones are pink not red like the picture shows.
1,I love it. This piece of jewelry will be worn frequently. I had it less then two days and have already had comments on it.
1,Well pleased with item - came in about 3 days. Fits well - unique styling - bought through amazon.com - well pleased with them also.
1,"This was a Valentine's Day gift,and I just love it. Ruby is my birthstone, and thelittle flowers, stems and leaves are just beautiful. I love this ring!"
1,Looked great. Despite other reviews the red enamel was the perfect color. Definitely ruby colored. It was given to my wife on valentine's day and she loved it.
1,"My fiancee absolutely loves this ring! I was afraid, due to other reviews, that the color would be too dull or dark. The color is a very bright ruby red! Wonderful!!"
1,Gave this as a gift. She received MANY compliments on it. Eve's Addiction has a lot of unique items. I Highly recommend their merchandise. It actually looks just like the picture. They also shipped FAST.
1,i have this ring but runs small so order this one size larger than you are cute better in person
1,Yes it is kind of pricey. BUTIt is probably the most unique ring under $100It is not the typical skinny silver with a rock in the middle.It has a red metallic shine and the silver flowers glimmer as well.When you walk the room people will notice.This is very much worth the money it costs. Its super cool.
1,"it's so nice for a ring, it's so perfect, i like it a lot. worth the price and shipping was fast"
1,I love the color and quality of these stones. I've bought many pairs of SilverSpeck earrings for myself and for friends!
1,This product was gorgeous and what it was as described. I would buy it again
1,"The bracelet's really cool & even better than I've expected! Fits my wrist perfectly. Deliveed in time - EvesAddiction, thank you, guys!"
1,"Birthday was today and WOW, a homerun! When he opened the cufflinks they had a pictures of our two Australian shepherds and he cannot weight to put the on and show everyone in the office. These have a solid, clean, sharp style and WHAT a deal at the price. They will be a treasure for years to come, Thank you CUFF DADDY and AMAZON."
0,"I wasn't expecting much from these earrinigs, seeing that they are only 6mm. I don't know what they measured them with, but I only get 4mm. I've seen nicer looking earrings at gas stations! $100?? These are so small that you don't even notice the ""Clover"" cut. They just look like tiny little chunks of glass."
1,To say I was feeling rather nervous about this purchase would be understatement but I read all the previous reviews and thought to take a chance.. As I could not find this item in the stores here it was my only hope to order off Amazon. I can confirm that the necklace the charm comes on is crap but all freebie necklaces with charms are - no surprise!!! You are paying for the charm and this star pendant is great - I used to wear a diamond heart and got bored of it...So thi is a nice change.. I wear every day... If anything I was surprised it was a bit bigger than what I imagined but not too big...Overall I am very happy!! And love the compliments I get on it - especially when the diamonds catch the light and sparkle :o)
0,"The star sparkles and it is a nice unassuming little gift for a friend.The chain was a disapointment. too flimsy, and it was tangled almost beyond repair.The star was little smaller than I expected, but it was still a good gift for the ocassion."
0,"These earrings are advertised to be 1/4"" in diameter (.24"" in another place in the description). They are TINY--not even 1/8"" in diameter--big difference. They are also advertised to be ""solid"" but another customer was told by customer service that they are hollow."
1,I was very impressed with the quality and beauty of these earrings. Great value for the money!!!!
1,"The earrings were delivered in a timely way, and appear as advertised"
1,"I am so pleased with my purchase. The earrings are of fine quality, and the price was just right for my budget. I know I will receive many years of pleasure and hopefully pass them down to my granddaughters."
1,"These earrings are a beautiful shade of blue, nice sized stones and very pretty, just as they were described. I gave them as gift but Ilike them so well that I may get a pair for myself."
0,"One of the earrings came defected; the front was facing back!The earrings are pretty but seriously, they look like $25 earrings. (or even less)"
0,"The citrine stone is absolutely beautiful, the best I've seen. The garnets in the picture are misrepresented. They are about the thickness of a piece of thread....honestly. The gold band is not much thicker...fairly thin. I don't really think the garnets are necessary and would prefer the ring without it. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have the garnets, but instead make the band just a tad wider."
0,"These look great on this page. However, either the seller's quality control failed or the quality level itself is not as pictured. The set I received was all tarnished, the stones were considerably lighter than pictured here, and, worst of all, the amethyst pair were missing. So I returned them. It took 2 weeks and several emails after the seller had received the return (delivery confirmation) for me to get my money back. No explanation from the seller regarding any of this, so I will not be doing business with Palm Beach Jewelry anymore."
1,"Lovely earrings! I gave them as a gift. The recipient seemed vry pleased with them. They are articulated, so they sway with movement. (In case you could not tell that from the picture.)"
1,Very cute pendant -- very sparkly. I bought it to jazz up a simple silver chain.
1,I bought the clear crystal flower and the blue crystal flower. I wear them together on a sterling silver chain. It provides the special accessory that I like without overpowering what I am wearing. The quality is excellent and I think they appear better in person than on line.
1,I love jewelry that sparkles. A very lovely gift for your near and dear ones or simply for yourself.
1,These are nice quality earrings at a very good price. The design is unusual and i get lots of compliments on them.
1,"This is a nice heavy band with beautiful leaves. I wear it all time. I get a lot of compliments, I have a friend that got it for her son. I love this ring."
0,"I am very happy with my purchase,except for one thing. I ordered a size 51/2 ring and was sent a size 6. It is a bit too big for me. I will think twice before ordering a sized article again."
1,The narrow center part has no &#34;goo&#34; so your jewelry stays stick-um free and the tag is easily removed with scissors. Great!
1,These lovely crystal earrings are perfect for daytime or dresses up any outfit for night. I couldn't believe the fine quality for such an amazingly low price. They make my blue eyes sparkle.
1,"I ordered this chain and was amazed at how quickly they shipped it to me. There was no delay at all. Two days after I paid for it, it was in my mailbox. I was impressed at the professional manner of the email contacts. I was even more impressed at the beautiful chain. Very attractive and sturdy. It's nice to deal with people who take pride in selling their products, making their customers happy and making the extra effort to rush the product to you. I have been a warehouse manager for nearly 20 years and appreciate these qualities because I aspire to them myself."
1,This is a very nicely made necklace that looks great on my 16 year old. He is thrilled as are we.
1,"I love this set- All different sizes and the links are very nice. I love having the ability to adjust my necklaces and I guess I have a big neck, as the average necklace size of 16=18 inches is too small for many looks. Again I am very happy, fast shipping as well and nicely packaged! :)"
0,"Item is Junk. Service is bunk. Need a zero star.Sorry to tell you, but this is JUNK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, EFFORT OR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.The extension I used for just under 2 hours dropped my necklace on the ground like a rock. Luckily, I wasinsightful enough to test it at home, and did not lose my necklace. Returned faulty items and was charged aHEFTY 20% restocking fee for this trash. thanks alot Amazon, thanks alot Carolyn Pollack Jewelry. Thanks for NOTHING!I will never buy anything from Carolyn Pollack Jewelry AGAIN!!!!"
0,... after wearing it just twice. It is not true vermeil - gold-plated silver. It looks more like cheap metal underneath.Not worth it.
1,"Great selection of sizes! Excellent quality, beautifully packaged. Arrived quickly. Would definitely deal with this vendor again!"
1,These extenders fit the bill. They came quickly & are very versatile. I'm very happy with them.
0,Merchandise took much too long for delivery! - 3 weeks too long after promised date. Elaborate packaging for item.Book ordered on the same day came very promptly.
0,"It looks really classy and elegant in the photo but it is not crafted very well. Think asian gift shop quality. The leatherette exterior had dents in it and the interior piece was roughly cut. Brass highlights are nice and it comes in a black cardboard box. At this price, I didnt expect too much anyway."
0,The ring box was just like a typical ring box. I didn't like the way it shut though. The spring showed wear and cheapness.
0,"I got this wore it two days and the palm tree fell off. if you have any experience with belly rings this happens all the time. No big surprise, but i was disappointed."
1,I bought these white gold earrings for myself. I had looked everywhere on the internet and at the local stores for just the right pair. These earrings have become my favorite. They are great for casual or dressy. I get many compliments on them.
0,"THE RING IS VERY PRETTY WELL MADE, HOWEVER THE ONYX SET MUCH MUCH SMALLERTHAN I THOUGH IT WOULD BE!!!"
1,"Bought this as a present for a girlfriend who loved it! It arrived in a pretty box, dainty, she was happy! Price couldn't be better."
1,"Received item within 2 days of purchase - although it may be because I live near where it was shipped. Bracelet is beautiful, sturdy and surprisingly light. It's the perfect thickness and looks beautiful on my wrist, I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,"This ring looks the way it does in the photo, so no surprises. It looks great on my finger and I have received several compliments on it, specifically on its style. This ring is versatile and looks great with other sterling silver jewelry that I own. The ring arrived promptly and I would definately recommend it to others because it looks pretty and it is inexpensive."
1,"It was the perfect size, it arrived fast, in new condition as stated. Would purchase from this seller again."
1,I ordered this bracelet for my mom for her birthday and fell in love with it when i seen it. I though it would have rusted in a few months or even broke but a year later it is still like new so i ordered one for myself. Great gift and price.
0,The shipping for this item is expensive! I was going to purchase these earrings until I saw the shipping cost.
0,"I thought they looked very nice, but they made my ears itch. My ears do well with gold and sterling silver usually."
1,"I can't believe how beautiful this necklace is. The pendant is really lovely. Tasteful and high quality. Other reviewers had mentioned that they were not as satisfied with the chain, but to be honest, the chain is working smoothly and looks completely appropriate. My boyfriend is 6'1"" and the 24"" chain is not even too long. It falls exactly as it should on him. What I like best about this necklace is that in total it all looks like it was made for a man. He loves it. Thank you to all the other reviewers. You helped me make a good decision. It really is perfect."
1,I just gotten this the other day. a must have for you and yours.a nice pendant for everyone so hurry and get yours.
0,"I loved it when it first arrived, but the little ring on the top of the star broke a month into wearing it. I was pretty careful with it. I wore it all the time but would take it off for bed and a shower yet it still broke. It is pretty though."
0,"These are lovely earrings that look far more expensive than they are ... except for the ""Blue CZ"" stones. They look and feel just like plastic. It's a terrible detriment to the set. I may have to have them replaced by a jeweler (if I can) in order for them to be appropriate for my brother-in-law's wedding. However, they look good enough that I'm looking for a matching necklace."
1,The jade earrings arrived exactly as pictured. I am very pleased and will enjoy them immensely. My order arrived promptly and with no fuss. Great experience with this vendor.
1,"I was very pleased with this pendant! It was even more beautiful than the picture. It is a very nice size and quality for the price. I was afraid the stone might appear a little bland, as often happens with moonstone that is not the best quality, but the color and fire in the stone was even more vibrant than can be seen in the photo. It would definitely be an asset to your jewelry collection. So far, I have been more than pleased with everything I have purchased from this merchant. The items were shipped quickly and in good condition."
1,"I bought it for my friend and she loved the pendant. It comes with a chain, but you have to buy it extra. It's not expensive, and she thought it was beautiful, which is enough to rate this 5 stars."
1,This is my third purchase from Netaya and I a pleased. This item arrived in a timely fashion and I look forward to doing more business with Netaya in the near future.
1,"I bought this for my fiance, thinking it would just be a temporary ring and she would pick something else later, but as it turns out she loves it and is keeping it. It is a very striking ring, big enough to look good with a larger stone, and her rock sits up and catches the light beautifully! (She said yes!)"
1,"My wife has a Poitiac Solstice. For Christmas I bought her the pendant and matching earings. The picture does not show the nice quality and how they shine. I was worried they would look flaky or cheap; they really look nice. They come in box that indicates its GM licensed. It looks best with a little thicker gold chain that you'll have to buy separate. I took the pendant to the jewelry counter and they matched the chain nicely.My wife is a clean freak about her car and does not drive it in rain or heaven forbid snow. In Winter the car is covered for weeks in the garage so dust or the dreaded dog hair does not get on the car. The earings and necklace come out when she misses driving it. They are worn when we go to a car club event or just out on a cruise.Sometimes she fools me when we go out on a Friday night; she'll wear the Pontiac jewelry and I think we are taking her car; then she'll want to go in our Honda rather than have to uncover the Pontiac. I ask her about it and she says ""I am a Pontiac person even if I am in a Honda"".The expensive stuff that I have bought her over the years stays at home and she wears these things. From the amount of times I have seen my wife wear them, I would say I hit a home run."
1,"I love this nice stirdy band. I wear it as a thumb ring. The name is nice & dark, I wash my hands a lot & it hasn't changed @ all. It is just cute."
1,They are a perfect size. Not too big nor too small. I would recommend these. :)It's a good price too! So pretty! ;)
0,"The metal of the earrings almost overwhelms the small stones. They're pretty, but look a little naked. For the price though, a decent buy."
1,"I bought this ring and was really impressed. It is very shiny, always new looking. If you keep it cleaned with silver jewelry wipes or cloths it stays like brand new. I have had alot of compliments and I wear this ring on a daily basis. From first glance you will think it is real diamonds. If someone is that close to my fingers and says its not -THEY NEED TO MOVE BACK. Guaranteed to impress. I would highly recommend to friends and family."
1,"My daughter entered the univercity, and i was looking for a present for her. I think this ring was a wanderfull precent for her. She liked it very much."
1,this item is amazing it made a perfect gift for my loved one. not only did she not know it was coming but she was shocked by it as well. it is as solid as silver can get and the heart shaped cubic zirconia is amazing looking
1,"i bought this for my wife and love it on her - very attractive, made well and looks fantastic. highly recommend!"
1,"I bought these to wear in my wedding. They arrived quicker than expected (which helped avoid stress) and they were beautiful. Just the right amount of sparkle and color. Thanks for my ""something blue""!"
1,This ring is beautiful. It looks exactly as pictured in the item listing. This ring was a birthday present for a friend of mine. She loved it!!!
0,"when this arrived, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. The gems were small but glistening. The silver nice and thick. The clasp was nice. However, after two day's of wear, I looked down and noticed several of the stones were missing. I ordered a replacement, and will update this review after I wear the new one for a couple of weeks."
1,"Got this yesterday and it is STUNNING! I have read other reviews that complained about the metal scratching the stone, and I cannot comment on that aspect yet, as it is new, but it is just gorgeous! I am wearing it today for the first time. I love it!Shipping was extraordinarily fast, and it was packaged very well. I highly recommend!!!"
1,"I got this for my sister for her birthday, it is beautiful. She has worn it to church almost every Sunday. I'm sure she will enjoy it for years to come."
1,"I bought this pendant as part of a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. It's properly weighted (definitely not too heavy nor does it feel flimsy and breakable) and looks very distinguished on the add-on chain; good deal for only an additional 5 bucks. It's a great size for someone who doesn't want anything too elaborate, that can be worn every day - between roughly a quarter and half-dollar. I'm not the greatest fashion consultant but can barely count on two hands the number of compliments she received JUST WHEN AROUND ME in a 2 week period. If you're looking for a thoughtful gift for anyone interested in Yoga, Buddhism, meditation, etc., this is a winner. Or if you're buying for someone who just likes interesting, nonconformist designs."
1,This sterling silver Om Pendant is absolutely beautiful and looks far more expensive than the actual price. It is comfortable enough to wear day and night and the photo does not do the pendant justice. What a fantastic purchase.
1,"I just received shipment of my order and the Pendant looks gorgeous, I was in two mind before I ordered it but after reading some of the previous reviews I Ordered and I am glad I did it."
1,I LOVE this necklace. It is so unique and pretty. I wear it all the time. Thank you so much for making and providing such a wonderful product.P
1,It is exactly as it looks. Really nice piece. About the size of a half-dollar so slightly larger than I'm used to wearing. The compliments are many.
1,"It is a beautiful size and looks great on a simple silver chain. I am so happy I got this one, and I have gotten a lot of compliments. I love it!"
1,"The pendant was smaller than I had expected, it's about 2cm long. But it's very elegant and subtle, while being unique and individual as well. I recommend the pendant to anyone who wants something a bit out of the ordinary but not over the top... It also arrived quite quickly considering it was an international shipment which can take up to 6 weeks, it arrived a week and a half, which was excellent!"
1,It's a gorgeous pendant and arrived quickly. I wish the bail was just a tad larger to fit my necklace through.
1,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and when i gave it to him he was shocked. he loves it and wears it everyday! The best part about it is he had his eye on it for sometime now and i didnt even know! Its a great pendant not to small or too big and looks great on the 1mm snake chain!"
1,"I just got this ring set in the mail today and I absolutely love it!!!! I had been looking for a wedding set that was just like my grandmothers & this is it. Classy, elegant, sparkly, beautiful, a real beauty."
1,"Wolf Dream Catcher is actually smaller than pictured. While it is nice, one must look closely to figure out what the medallion actually is. Light but sturdy. The beaded adornments slide along the cord freely and with some work on your part, it might hang at its longest nicely.However, the cord is quite thin and disappointing and seems to be permanently curled from packaging and shipping position. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to straighten the cord so it hangs evenly. There are several twists and curls in it that make it look dumb. Although it is adjustable by a simple pull-the-knot-through-the-loop closesure, it doesn't stay where you put it. The slightest movement and it drops back to its longest.This would be much nicer on a chain that hangs appropriately. However, the openings in the adornment beads is so small, I doubt purchasing a separate chain would work. While the chain might fit through the beading and the bail for the medallion itself, I have yet to figure out how to get the loop at the beginning of the chain (that the lock attaches to) through the beads to begin the threading process. Don't think there is a chain out there small enough to fit yet strong enough to hold. Now, if one wanted to remove the loop for the closure on a chain, thread the chain through the beads and medallion and then reattach the closure loop, I am sure that would work. I just don't want to go through all that work. This is going back.p.s. I also purchased, at the same time, the Wolf Tooth necklace. Same holds true for that one. And in the picture online, the wolf's head appears to have varied colors on it distinguishing it from the 'tooth'. However, mine is all the same color so, once again, unless one looks closely, it is difficult to determine what the medallion actually is. The cord is the same as above. This one is also going back.The Wolf Earrings, on the other hand, while small, are great. Sturdy post that doesn't seem as if it will bend easily. These are very small so look best as a second piercing adornment, but can be worn alone for a more subdued look.The Wolf Cuff bracelet is nice, and looks much sturdier than it is. The first time I put it on and tried to gently bend the sides to fit my wrist better as one must do with most cuffs, the section where the wolf is attached got 'bend marks' in it. So now the cuff looks like a 3-sided box - actual bend marks showing top and both sides. I'll keep it because I bent it but doubt I'll wear it often."
0,The only thing I was disappointed in the earrings is the size. I thought they might be a little bigger. I love the details in the earrings. I would highly recommend this seller to anyone who loves wolf jewelry like I do.
1,"I received this as a birthday gift, and I love it.It is a beautiful bracelet, well-constructed.Classy.It is the perfect gift for an August birthday.I definitely recommend that you buy this bracelet."
1,A holiday gift for my daughter which is her daughters birthstone. It's stunning and I'm sure a winner!
1,"gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous!The stones were a light green and a little cloudy but they still sparkle really brightly. The construction of the silver is solid."
1,"I am not one to write reviews, but my husband and I are so very happy with this ring, that I could not resist sharing this with you. The picture cannot display how amazing this ring is. And, it is definitely a bargain for the price!"
1,This large piece will attract attention and envious glances. It is well graced with good design and quiet beauty. Enjoy it for years to come and then make it a splendid generation gift. mclg
1,I gave this ring to my husband for our 13th anniversary. His original gold ring was very beat up and way too big since he has lost a large amount of weight since our wedding. The Titanium of this ring is great. Besides the everyday wear it has to endure we are also building a house ourselves so it has to handle lots of banging. So far so good. It is also BEAUTIFUL!
0,I bought this ring for my husband and he wore it for six days on our Honeymoon before I noticed a lot of chips and dents on it. After calling Amazon customer service I was fairly certain that it would be returned if I sent it back. Turns out they WON'T return it and now I am out two hundred dollars! I am livid! They claim that it was scratched due to wear and since it has been worn it is no longer returnable even if its defective! The ring was even returned about two weeks after it was purchased. This product was disappointing and customer service didn't help in the least. So sad.
0,"When I got this necklace it was a little thinner than I thought it would be, but it was very lovely. The shine was brilliant and the clasp was so pretty. I gave it to my mom as a birthday present. The very FIRST time she tried to put it on the clasp snapped off so that it needs to be sautered back in place.***EDIT*** I contacted the seller and they fixed the necklace in a timely manner. Keeping fingers crossed that this one holds up."
1,"This is a wonderful cross, the copper shines beautifully changing from red to gold in the sunlight and the necklace as a whole is a great piece. As a man I wish that the chain were longer, however that is my only complaint and I am finding a nice leather cord for it to go on since I cannot find a longer copper chain. Once again I was very pleased with the cross and would definitely buy it again!"
1,This is a very nice pendant and chain. I am wearing it now and plan to wear itoften. I think you will really love this too.
0,"This necklace is very pretty, and the person I gave it to loved it. However, it is very small! I was shocked when I got it in the mail, because it's about the size of a dime! But very pretty, good quality."
1,I purchased the ring for myself and I absolutely love it. It is a lil bigger than I thought but its hello kitty I can't complain:)
0,"This was much nicer than I thought it would be. Very pretty, and classy. Given and recieved with great appreciation. She is thrilled, and doesn't know the (low) price."
1,"I'm very happy with my purchase. The product arrived in 2 days from the time it was shipped. It is great for someone who wants a Celtic cross that isn't too big, but also isn't too small. I'd say its for a guy or a girl, but you might want to order a separate necklace to hold the pendant, if it is for a guy."
0,"Well, I was really excited about this ring, but when it came in, it was so yellow that I think all the color drained from my face when I saw it. I really tried to like it, but couldn't get past the yellow. Other then the color, which it does say is low, it was a beautiful ring. Just not for me."
1,Very beautifully made. The dainty rosese are just what I wanted! I love it & have gotten many compliments on it wheneverI wear it
1,"I bought this necklace for myself. I liked the contrast of the black and white stones. It is a beautiful necklace; quite substantial - but not overly. It is the perfect size to be worn with anything, and I cannot think of an outfit it would not compliment. I am very happy with this purchase, and recommend it highly."
1,"I got this necklace on the St Valentines Day and I can say that it is great and I love it. Shining, delicate, elegant."
0,"The sapphire I received wasn't as blue as the one in the photo. The diamonds surrounding it were a lot smaller and the sapphire looks scratched. This makes me wonder if the sapphire is really genuine. Also, the box it came in was crushed. I need a new one to put it in before I give it away as a Christmas gift. To be fair, the pendant is still pretty just not as beautiful as it is in the picture.On the bright side, the shipping was fast. I am unsure if I'd ever order from them again. A solid ""maybe..."""
1,I ordered this for my Wife's Birthday for Feb 1st. Ordered it on Jan 21st and received it on Jan 23rd. The picture doesn't do this piece justice. The design is simple and classy and can be worn with just about anything. The Amethyst is not gaudy or sticks out like a sore thumb. Beautiful and elegant and very pleasing.
1,I'm pleased I purchased this unique pendant. It stand out and really makes the wearer feel special. I'd recomend it to anyone whos a fantasy fan.
0,These are made for infants only... even then you have to be careful because the backing is not secured. I would not recommend this purchase for an adult who is seeking studs.
0,Bought this as a Christmas gift but when they came they were so small I couldn't find the second ear ring in the bag. Needless to say I sent these back.
0,"I ordered these as an ""extra"" gift for my Mom. It would have been an embarrassment to give these to her. They are so small that they would go through the piercing hole in her ear. Very, very disappointed. I am returning for my $46.00 refund."
1,"i bought this pair of earrings as a christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves it!!!! though there's a small problem... it's a little bit undersized, i thought it would be much bigger."
0,"While I suppose I shouldn't expect much for $30, the picture of the earrings on an ear showed that they would be bigger than what they are. They are tiny little things, though overall they look nice. I was just expecting an earring that was at least twice the size."
0,"the earrings were much smaller than what they appeared to be on the website, other than that they were fine."
0,"They were nice earrings but too small, so you must check the description very well before purchase something."
0,"The earrings are very tiny. The diamond is barely visible, the picture is not true to size. If you are looking for an earring to wear alone, I would not recommend, otherwise they are perfect for a second earring or if you are looking for tiny."
1,just what I wanted I have sensitive skin and these work great for me I have a larger set and these fit my second hole just like I like and the metal does not bother my skin
1,"I love these earrings!! i wear them in my third hole. They are very petite like me! I will see if I can purchase another pair of diamond cut earrings just a little bit bigger, next time."
0,I did not think the earrings would be huge but I did expect to be able to see them with the naked eye. These are too small for even a newborn. I would not order them for anyone older than 5 days old. I think if I put these in my ears they will go through the hole in my ear. If you want more bling than these earrings just buy a stick pin and put it in your ear it will be larger than this diamond. Huge disappointment.!!!!
0,"It is very tiny,and not as shining as I suposed. However, it is diamond,right? According to the price .Much money for better thing."
0,"Small tiny earrings.The stone should be diamonds, but I saw diamonds before, and those looks more like plastic.Very very disappointing."
0,"very cute but very small, the picture presented varies greatly with the original size.the earrings are like for a girl under 5 years for big size mismatch.but they are very cute and I'm still happy with the purchase."
0,"these were so small they went throw the holes in my ears, returned them was the best use for the item."
1,"I really love theseAs other reviewers have noted, they are small; but what would you expect for $49.00 gold and diamonds?they are really shiny and I love wearing them, in fact I haven't taken them out since I got them."
0,They are nice but smaller than what I expected. They could be suitable for a very young girl who is less than 10 years.I am glad that were good for my daughter.Thank you.Saeed
0,So tiny! I got them for my mom but I had to give it to my newborn niece. Cannot see the diamonds...just a little spark in the middle. So remember
0,"One star for fast shipping, but these were pinhead sized and definitely not worth 1/2 the price. Kudos to Amazon for removing the misleading picture however I do think the add is still misrepresenting the value of the earrings."
1,"Although the earrings are nice, don't be fulled by the picture the diamonds are very small, but for the price I paid should have expected them to be. The quality is what was advertised, but looking at the picture one could think they are bigger than they actually are."
0,"I started looking for a pair of earrings to wear in my second hole. When I found these, I thought they would be great, they were the right price, and looked like a nice pair. However, when I received them and put them on, the backings were too loose for the post (so I had to put stoppers on the backs)and I lost both earrings within a couple of days. They also infected my ears within a day. I expected an earring that's advertised as 10k Gold to not cause an infection, but I was wrong. Buyer beware! These really aren't worth the money! Find a different pair of earrings that may cost a little more."
0,"I purchased this about two and half weeks ago along with some other things. the other things have arrived, and yet this hasn't even been shipped. the estimated delivery is over two weeks, which means I will have waited over a month to receive the earrings by the time I finally get it. That is bad service. I will write another review rating the actual product when I receive it. Had I known it would take so long, I would have just paid more and went to the jewelry store down the street."
0,They appear to be much larger in the description. Expensive for the size. Made in china And not packaged nice for giving as a gift
0,when i got it i was surprise its too small than i thought. but i think its okay anyways. be careful next time
0,way too small. Picture is misleading. Pretty but I think they will go right through my daughters holes in her ears.
0,The earings were well crafted but one diamond had a defect so I returned the set. They were also much smaller than I expected (a good size for baby jewelry).
1,"The earings arrived as advertised,and on time. I gave as a Christmas gift. I will shop at Amazon.com again"
1,"I have searched online as well as my local jewelry stores for a princess cut diamond that was small enough for my nose. The prices I heard for the same cttw, color and clarity was an average of $70 higher. You can't beat what you get for this price. They were perfect !"
1,"This toe ring is really awesome. it suites my toes really well and nothing happened to the ring even after everyday use. I am using this ring for the past 3 months. The rings can be on contact with water but not to be used with detergent, If you do so, inside of the ring is getting blackened out.Otherwise, it is awesome!"
1,I LOVE my Elephant Toe rings.......ROLL TIDE!Shipper got them to me FAST!Thanks!!I will be back!!!
0,"I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it."
1,"The necklace holds a nice oval shape, depending on how heavy of a pendant is hung on it, without one its nice and round, and never loses its rounded shape. The wire itself is a wrapped wire, very sexy and high class. It matches the silver pendants perfectly and adds to the look of value for a necklace."
1,"The cuff was perfect except it was too big and I had to spend extra money to have it resized, None your fault. Other than that, completely satisfied with timely delivery, the product, etc. Thank you"
0,"I purchased this to go with the silver and black pendant http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00023JTAM/ref=pd_ys_iyr3/103-2293436-8105424?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glanceand it looks great! I am very carefull with it but the chain necklace can easily be bent and that will cause a bend in the chain. but, thats common for lots of styles of chain.Overall it wears well and I have gotten several compliments on it."
1,"I sell jewelry including pendant and sterling chain combinations. I bought one of these since the price was reasonable and the quality looked good....I was not disappointed. Along with a handcrafted pendant, it was sold to a very satisfied customer. I am purchasing two more because the 18"" omega is diffcult to find in my area.My only complaint would be that the shipping could have been more carefully done, though everything did arrive in good condition. I am hoping it will be more secure with this order..."
1,This is a quality piece. I wear it with many different pendants. I love it and it was a great value as well.
1,"I have purchased this garnet/marcasite pendant and have to say I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The marcasites add just the right touch and the garnet itself is of excellent quality. I was even thinking it would be a bit smaller than I thought, so I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the pendant and it's appearance! So many of my friends & coworkers comment it looks like a wonderful heirloom piece, and it's been proudly worn daily since I got it! Again I say for the price, you won't be disappointed in the least. Service was quick from the time I ordered & it came in a box suitable for gift-giving. I am totally pleased with this pendant and would not hesitate to order from this company again!"
0,"I haven't taken this bracelet to a gemologist yet, but I suspect the word ""genuine"". I own many crystals, and this has the look and feel of plastic. If I take it to a gemologist I will edit this review and let you know for sure. Just be warned it is suspect, and in my opinion not worth the purchase."
1,This is exactly as pictured and it is very nice. I bought this for my son who is very happy with it. It comes on a silver chain which is very nice but I kept it because he used a thicker chain he already had. Great price for the product. Buy it.
0,"Buyer beware, I've owned this bracelet for a year and a half only to find out the ""sterling silver"" wears down to something remotely resembling copper. I loved this bracelet up until then. I'm very disappointed that Amazon would represent this company without making sure you get what you pay for. I know it's not the most expensive bracelet out there, but for 38.00 I know I can get better than dime store costume jewelry."
1,"I must admit that I was very impressed with this product when I got it. I love it and am hooked on it.... The amazing part is how cheap it is. If you love the phoenix. This is no doubt... The best thing to wear..... But you should but another chain for it, after wearing it two days my neck turned green. But the pendent on it is amazing.... Worth buying"
1,this is very nice i do like older forms of religion and how they went about things and this truly shows it right here i got it for my sister and she just loves it
1,"Was purchased as a gift and was very well received. The quality of the bracelet was great and it was beautiful as well,"
0,This was a total waste of money. The pendant started losing its color in a week's time.
0,The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design. It does not go with the center design. I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look. Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.
1,I ordered this bracelet as a gift. This bracelet is so beautiful and it has a nice weight to it. It's worth the price.
0,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 14 YR OLD DAUGHTER AND WITHIN 2 WEEKS THE STONES FELL OUT. THEY WERE ONLY GLUED TO THE PENDANT. THE METAL STARTED TO TARNISH AT ABOUT 3 WEEKS. THIS IS VERY POORLY MADE. THE STONES ARE GLUED ON AND THE METAL TARNISHES. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
1,"This bracelet is really very nice. The Tanzanite looks VERY good and everything sparkles beautifully. I see where one reviewer said it was a little big...it is a full 7"" bracelet, but it's not slipping off my hand. Good tight clasp and the prong sets for the stones seem very strong. Not too heavy, either. I love it. What a great Mother's Day present from my husband!"
0,"These came in handy in a pinch for work, since we weren't allowed to wear any visible piercings. The backing is poor, however. It's just a little clear elastic on the back, so they pops off really easily and get lost. They're hard to see when they fall out because they are clear.Good for very temporary occasions when needed, but I don't recommend this for long term use."
0,"I brought this to coordinate with a muli colored turquoise, and coral necklace, it matched color wise but the quality doesnt match the presence of the necklace. It's a lot smaller in person, and crafty."
1,The necklace arrived in a timely fashion and was much prettier than the photo depicted! It even came with a tiny storage bag. I am very pleased!!
0,It is cute in person but smaller than expected. Be sure to read the dimesions. About an inch across and 1/2 inch high.
1,I was pleasantly suprised when I recieved this bracelet.It is more beautiful than in the photos.
0,"If this is leather I'll eat my hat. The bracelet is thin, feels and looks like plastic, the turquoise is also paper thin - I have never had an online purchase be this disappointing. I wanted to return it, but I have to pay the shipping. My first try at buying jewelry through Amazon - and my last."
1,"These are high quality earrings with nice detail, very attractive and a great value. I usually wear them with jeans and heels but they would be fine for dressier occasions. One of my better jewelry buys."
1,"My wife is not a very frilly lady, so these simple beautiful earrings suit her perfectly. She loves them."
0,"Pretty and comfortable, but quite small. I think these earrings were made for a child or early teen. They are quite comfortable and I can sleep in them, but they are very subtle. Good quality. I just wish they were a bit bigger in circumferance."
1,Bought this for my wife and she simply fell in love with it. Great price and great gift. I would give it a 10 star! Diamond is perfect!
1,"A gal can never have too much bling! Great value, pretty and seems solidly made. Recommend."
1,"the bracelet is exactly what its advertised to be, is a very nice piece of custom jewelry and is and was admired. The daughters alwo found it to be the cat's meow . . ."
1,"Little bigger than expected, but really nice. I would not wear it everyday because it appears to be fragile for active wear."
1,"Just got my bracelet delivered yesterday, and I must admit that I was a little worried because of other reviews saying that it was really big & fake looking. Let me tell you that I absolutely love this bracelet. It is big and it's sparkly but that's how we like things in Texas!! I am not disappointed at all. Wore it to work today and got so many compliments on it. I straight up told my friends it was CZ & they were like ""Who cares! It's gorgeous!!"" :) Would totally recommend to others."
1,"You know, it's all in the eyes of the beholder!! Some of the reviewers stated they didn't like the large stones, but I love big, plus this bracelet is well made. If you like bling, this is the bracelet to buy. Mary"
1,This is very nice and looks very real. Very good price for such quality. It sparkles and is great to wear everyday. Love it!
1,Super will buy again what more can I say great grift to give someone thank you very much peace out
1,"Really nice tennis bracelet gift for a fraction of the cost. Hard to tell that it is not the real thing.Wife loved the gift for Christmas, and she wears it all the time."
1,I always wanted a tennis bracelet and since I can't afford real diammonds this made a great alternative. It is really fashionable.-
1,Purchased this as a Christmas gift---I am certain that the wife will just love it.It was exactly as described in the positing. Seller was prompt and efficient. Item arrivedquicker than I had expected. Had no problems and will definitely consider checking out this seller again.
1,"I just wanted to let everyone to know that I received the ring faster than I expected and it couldnt have been packed any better. My wife also loved it so I couldnt be happier. I would suggest anyone thinking about doing business with this seller to do so, because of my wife being happy Im happy. Thank you again and I look foward to doing business with again."
1,"This lovely ring is just what I wanted to compliment a pave style halo engagement ring I have. It is not too wide and not too narrow, and it shines and matches the pave stones on my engagement ring. It's a lovely ring for either a wedding ring, eternity ring or just to add some sparkle to your finger. It is comfortable and looks great. I love it!"
1,"These are cute little earrings, good for the price. They are about 1/3"" wide, and have a surprising amount of sparkle considering the diamonds are so small."
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend. She frequently wears heart-shaped jewelry, usually themed, and the ""crooked"" heart with amethyst was very much her style.The chain is very thin, and the pendant isn't overly shiny, so it makes a nice statement while not attracting too much attention."
0,"The pendant looks as advertised and is very pretty, however it was shipped in just a small velvet pouch without the cardboard cutout that necklaces usually ship in, so the chain was severely tangled with the heart. It took over 2 hours with a toothpick and pair of tweezers to untangle it.Other than that, no complaints. If yours does not come all tangled up, you'll like it."
1,"I wear these alot. Sometimes have trouble with wire earring coming out of the ear lobe, have never had that happen with these. Wires are sturdy, Good weight, but not heavy. Very pretty."
1,"I love this necklace. I was pretty impressed with the quality for the price. I hate buying jewelery online, but this one really was worth it! And it looks great on!"
1,"Good, I like it, looks nice and charm, useful in everyday life, is not heavy I recommended it to all."
1,This ring is very beautiful! I bought it for my daughter . Pictures don't do this ring justice! It is beautiful in person! She loves it and so do all her friends and family!
1,"I bought this ring not too long ago and proposed to my girlfriend. When I showed her the ring, she wept with happiness. It completely took her breath away. I am VERY pleased with the way it came out. It looks 100 times more briliant and shiny than it does in the picture. Excellant value too! I was kind of taking a leap of faith so to speek, by buying an engagement ring without seeing it in person first, but I am 100% happy with the result, and so is my Fiance! I would reccomend this ring to anyone."
1,Bought this bracelet for my girlfriend and it absolutely made her day! high quality and perfect Celtic design. I would defiantly recommend this to any guy looking for a gift.
1,it looks so freakin kool because that freaky skeleton and that its made of sterling-silver
1,"This is an absolutely beautiful ring with such a great quality (F color, VS2); even better than description. And it did come with a certification. I got it from the gold box deal and the price was unbeatable. Plus, it arrived fast via UPS next day delivery for FREE. This was my first time to buy jewelry online and I was very pleased."
1,"High quality, cute, fun to wear, and bigger than I thought it would be. Great for bunny lovers everywhere!"
1,"This is a beautiful and unique piece. It was a Valentines Day present, and I love it!"
1,I purchased a bunch of these as gifts for leaders in my parish. They have been a big hit! Great quality. Really nice looking. Affordable.
1,I am very pleased with my pewter necklace which arrived quickly. It is well-made and I have received many compliments on it. I would buy from this company again!
1,Wonderful size for high school young man. Looks well made. Arrived exactly on time as indicated. It will be a very appropriate present for Confirmation
1,I chose this item because someone requested a celtic cross for Christmas. I think they liked it. It was a gift.
1,"It's wonderful and I have been wearing it everyday since I bought it. It's the perfect size, it is not too large and flashy but it's not tiny either."
0,This piece is beautiful. but the Rope fell apart after 2 weeks. I would recommend having a backup for when it goes
1,This blue crystal penant was as described. It is a nice item for the price. I think it is best for a young adult or child.
0,"The title is wrong. This is a PENTACLE. The way it's attached to the chain's clip, the point is facing up, making it a pentacle. If the point were facing down, THEN it would be a pentagram. Subtle difference, but there is one. &lt;/3"
0,"I bought this because it looked so pretty and had such good reviews. However 10 days after it was purchased it broke. Not made very well for a bracelette, the metal pc that are the connections are way to thin & fragile. Its VERY light!!!! Wouldnt advise purchase of this"
1,This piece of jewelry more than made my Wife's Day. A must buy for Husbands with needy wives.
0,"Smaller and less sturdy than I expected. But not too terrible for the price, I guess."
1,"Loved it so much had to buy more! Color is excellent fun to wear.Shipping was fast, thank you"
0,It is very pretty but it is unbelievable sad marine life is at danger only for vanity purposes such as jewerly
1,"In addition to being completely satisfied with this transaction, I am also extremely pleased with the items that were purchased. These are exactly the pink fire opal earrings I have been trying to find! No, wait--That isn't quite right--Actually these earrings are much prettier and of a better quality than I had anticipated so I'm pleasantly surprised--quite unexpected; Okay, that's enough about me. My items arrived before I expected them to arrive and in better condition than I thought they would--beautiful pieces! I would definitely buy from this seller again."
0,"I ordered several of these bracelets for gifts; but, only one bracelet had pearls that were anywhere near 4mm. The pearls were so tiny that they looked like seeds instead of pearls. I decided to return them and look for something else. Don't waste your money."
1,"This piece of jewelry was not only BETTER then described, but arrived PROMPTLY after being purchased. I was very impressed with the fine detail, especially on the square because it even includes digits on both sides.Just to be sure, it is somewhat of an abnormally large pendant, so if ""larger size"" is not your thing, it may appear to be a bit ostentatious, but for my own personal taste, it was perfect. I'm considered a ""big person"" @ 6'5"", so personally, though the pendant is rather large, it felt normal on me.But in reality, the size of the pendant may not matter altogether because this piece wouldn't normally be made visible to just anyone.Accuracy of picture and description - 10Delivery Time - 10Overall satisfaction - 10."
0,These erring look better online than in person. I hardly use them at all. They look rather cheap in person and stone is smaller than it looks online. Not sparkly at all. Disappointing!
1,"I have used these clear risers for small figurines, and found they are wonderful in showcasing my collection. My order shipped quickly, was packaged with extreme care and well worth the cost. A must have for any collector."
1,"The necklace arrived promptly and in a nice box. The angel was a little larger than I was expecting, but it is very pretty. The chain is very nice and sturdy, which is good because I break necklaces if the chain is too delicate.Overall, a nice necklace for the price."
1,"I thought that it was made well and its also not very heavy, in fact it's quite light. I wish it was slightly longer but it doesn't really detract from the necklace at all. I was very happy with and for the price I thought that it was a good buy."
0,"The title about sums it up... Nice, but not very neatly done (at least, mine wasn't) - for instance, dried glue showed from underneath the round decoration on the square pendant."
0,I was very disappointed
1,Ordered for my wife. She loved it. Great quality and looks nice. Came early too. Will order from this seller again.
1,"I bought this because I needed to draw some spiritual strength from the carnelian. Since it stretches, it's really comfortable to wear. These look especially pretty worn in bunches (I bought 5). Contrasts nicely with any earthtone colored clothing. That's my favorite color palette, so these are quickly becoming my signature piece!Notes on Carnelian:The wearing of carnelian is recommended to those who have a weak voice or are timid in speech, for the warm-colored stone will give them the courage they lack, so that they will speak both boldly and well,"" reports G. E Kunz, well known gemologist and historian.Spiritual Properties"
1,"These earrings are beautiful and all of my purchaces from Artazis have been wonderful, exactly as described in the pictures."
1,the mother/daughter necklace is so beautiful.shipped in a nicely timed manner.and a gift card for next purchase was nice.thank you
1,"Sadly this item is no longer in stock, but I was one of the lucky ones to get one on time.Very nice, looks a lot more expensive than what it really is.It was a lovely gift!"
0,"Returned this charm..As I wrote earlier, buy the discs, they are more attractive..This charm is very small..There was no problem, and the people were courteous.."
1,"I bought this charm for my boyfriend on our 1 year anniversary. He is 100 miles away from me and its a struggle at times, OMG....he loved it so much. He told me just the other day, baby I where my necklace everyday and I kiss it twice in the morning....once for the man on it and again for you. This charm is a very great buy and I would recommend it to everyone.....Sterling Silver 1 7/8"" (47 mm) Diamond Cut Jesus Carrying the Cross Pendant"
1,"I have bought several times at GemAffair and love them. Although I did not buy this particular item, the items I bought were great quality and received timely delivery and customer service. I bought Christmas presents, sent birthday presents and graduation presents through GemAffair and intend to keep on shopping with them. Oh, did I mention they had great prices too !"
1,I search and searceh for just the right ring at Christmas. Settle on this one. And it is more than expected and the shipping was last minute and still arrived before Christmas.
0,"The metal backs used to hold the stand up keep breaking off. Out of the 10 shipped, only 6 still stand. I'll have to break out some glue to put the others back together."
0,I was out of town and ordered it for my wife on line. When I was able to see it I was totally shocked how small it was. The picture over stated its size.
1,The charm was just as shown in the picture. It arrived in a little over a week's time and is nice.I would order from this company again.
1,This necklace was a gift and she loved it. It is even prettier than the picture gives justice. I was a little nervous about the clasp bt my girlfriend really likes it because it is easy to put on. The brown cord is thick and makes a nice contrast with the blue/green of the stone.
0,"These are pretty earrings, but the pearl is much smaller than I expected."
1,"I have owned and cherished this medal for about a year now. Though I bought it on Amazon, I'm not sure if I bought it from this retailer. It is by far the best looking of all the St. Christopher medals I have seen on this, or any website. I am happy with its amazing detail. It is just different enough to stand out over all the others."
0,"I ordered this and got it in about a week, which is good. But I got one with dark colors and not pastels, so I wrote and told them about it and they said they would send me another one, which they did in just a few days, but they sent me the same one they sent in the first place. So either they have the wrong photo up or a crappy camera cuz it doesn't look like the photo."
1,"I got this for one of my nieces. It's a beautiful necklace, well made, and she just loves it. All her aunts want one, or one like it."
0,Bought this ring for a gift for my wife and one of the Sapphire fell out of the ring two days after having it.
0,Didn't like this ring at all when we received it. I looks really fake and cheap. Big stone looks like glass and the metal actually looks like plastic.
1,"I love how the sapphires in the ring are actually dark blue and not a lighter shade, it makes the ring look very expensive. I've never had any problems with the ring and continuously get compliments on it."
0,"it is beautiful, but got dirty very fast! I'm still trying to clean it with the right stuff, but it's worth it, b/c it's gorgeous and a wonderful size. And too adorable."
1,"I love these! They are small enough so they don't look overtly gregarious. They look exactly like real diamonds too! I have these as the first in a row of three, the following two are real diamonds, and honestly you cant tell the difference. I want more holes just so I can buy more of these in a larger size!"
0,"I thought these would look like real diamonds considering the diamonique name. However, when compared to my older $5 studs, I didn't see much of a difference. If you really want nice diamond earrings, I suggest you go real."
1,"SOOOO cute and even more special since we have now received our 2 Border Terrier puppies, 9 weeks old. Thank you!!!"
0,"Though I still like this necklace, I was a bit disappointed upon receiving it. It looked much larger in the picture, with longer cord and the stones looked larger. Given its actual size, I don't think it was worth the price."
0,"Cet article ne donne pas un look s&eacute;rieux, a fait comme du toc. Il fait genre pacotille alors que la photo ne le laisse pas entrevoir. Les boules orange sont faites de billes transparentes qui lui donne un genre 'pour adolescent'. Je ne m'y attendais pas du tout."
0,I bought the 2mm size and had to send them right back as the ball came off when I tried to remove the back to try them on. Very disappointing.
1,I got these earrings for myself and they fit fine in the third hole in my ear. These earrings are super tiny and they look smaller than they do in the picture so go by the 2mm measurement for a size reference! They don't fit in my second hole which I gaged (to a size 4) a year ago and have since then closed up - by not fitting I mean I could pull them through the hole.
1,"I really loved these earrings. They can be worn with just about any color outfit. They are extremely lightweight. And the price is low! I loved them so much, that I bought a pair for my sister."
0,"what a fool am I. Already one 'stone' from each earring has dropped off...and those 'stones' look suspiciously like plastic. they are so small and my eyes are so old that I can't tell for sure! I do wear the earrings; but, be warned, they are not worth what you're paying!"
1,Was looking for something that would please an 8-year-old granddaughter. Love this as it can be added to so gives easy ideas for future gifts.
1,This ring exceeded all my expectations. the diamonds are beautiful and large. The band is substancial. I got more ring for my money.
1,"My mom and I ordered this necklace (along with a 16 in. black silk cord ""chain"") for our 9-year-old granddaughter/niece for Christmas. I was hesistant to order it because 1) the name of the company was a little nuts ""Insanity"" and 2) we really were looking for horse-related pendants, not ""mystical"" unicorns for this little girl in our lives. What a pleasant surprise to discover that this beautifully-animated/decorated piece looks much MORE like a horse than a unicorn. It came in a little pouch. We purchased the mare/foal wooden keepsake box also and placed the necklace (as one of two) in it. The horse pendant is a great piece of art for any horse lover!"
1,My boyfriend bought me this anklet. I love it! It's well made but still delicate and pretty. I rarely take it off. It can be adjusted so you can wear it with the star dangling or shorter. Good quality item.
1,"I love the jewerly line Paris has created. I admire her hard work and dedication to all she does. The jewerly is beautiful. Thank you Paris, can't wait to see what you come out with next!Heather"
1,This belly button ring and the star hoop earrings are my favourite pieces from the whole line and when they are both in stock I will definitaley be buying them.
0,All the crystals fell out of this ring and the metal came off the back. Will turn your belly green!
1,"I got this expecting it to just be a ""weekend"" piece of jewelry but I have had it in for almost 3 months now. I hav't gotten infected, green skin, loose pieces or anything that was mentioned in some of the other reviews. This is one of the most comfortable pieces of body jewelry and I plan on wearing it for as long as possable."
1,"My wife loved the earrings. She liked them because they are pink, and they match everything she uses. She liked the quality too."
1,"I just purchased these Pink Heart Paris Hilton earings and I just love them!!!!! The color is perfect, the size is just right, and they glitter and shimmer! Paris has done a wonderful job creating this line of jewelry. I can't wait to buy more of her jewelery!!! These are the perfect earings for any girly girl or princess."
1,"These earrings are even prettier in person. They really shine and sparkle. They are a nice weight. Very high quality. Good value. Thanks, Paris! Now, pleae design a bracelet and necklace to match them!!!"
0,I was very dissappointed with my bracelet. The stones fell out. I ordered a second one and the same thing happened again. Hopefully they will resolve this problem. It is a very cute bracelet and hope there will be remedy for the problem soon. I'd like to have another one.
1,[...] When ordering jewelry view all the enlargement pictures. Saves a disapointment later. The only heart clasp is on the anklets. It is a very nice lobster clasp on the bracelet. The crown tag on all Ms. Fields pieces adds a wonderful touch. D. Bishop
1,This bracelet is so cute~~Paris make more ~~I love them so much~
1,"I love pearls but wanted something a little more contemporary and less ""matronly"" than a string of pearls, and this necklace is just gorgeous. Excellent craftsmanship, and the perfect size, this necklace is my new favorite. The chain it comes with is wonderful--delicate but strong. I highly recommend this beautiful necklace and cannot say enough good things about it!"
1,Earrings are beautiful. Arrived quickly and were well represented in the description. I wear them everyday. Thanks Amazon for another great purchase.
0,"I saw a chain just like this in Claire's the other day. It cost $15, and I'd bet any amount of money that it would last longer than Hilton's line - and this is from a store known for its cheaply-made costume jewelry.Guess what, girls? A 3-and-a-half-foot long sterling silver chain with glued-on ""crystals"" (read"
1,"I love this necklace and I LOVE Paris! It is sooo cute, just like Paris! I get alot of compliments on it too. I am not too big on jewelry at all either but I plan on getting some more of her stuff from this line."
1,"This necklace if so effing cute, except that the beads come unlinked sometimes. plus i lost it so now i have to buy another one....i suggest u buy her book to its rather funny. this necklace is so cute i got tons of compliments, so all u biotches out there who wanna look hot.. BUY IT!"
1,I really like thias necklace and I think it is really feminine and girly and you also don't have to be a multi millionaire to be able to afford nice quality pieces. Also pink is my favourite colour and this necklace would match all my outfits.
1,"I recieved the earrings... and they are exactly as pictured. I was very pleased with them! They seem to be of good quality and I'm sure they will be fun to wear.One thing to note... they are a little bit heavy... well, heavier than i expected."
1,"I just love the sterling silver and crystal star hoop earrings by Paris. The shape and the size are perfect. I love Paris' jewelry line, its beautiful and I love it even more now that it is coming down in price. Very affordable and adorable. LUVS IT!!"
0,"The necklace arrived promptly and was packaged very nicely. I wasn't that impressed with the size, it was alot smaller then i imagined. The mecklace was very cute though. I expected the cord to be longer, also a little overpriced for what you receive."
1,I got this neckless for christmas from my husband. I was so excited. I loved it. Nice size color style I wore it in the mall the other day. I had two people stop me and ask me if that was the Paris Hilton neckless and where did I get it. It was funny. I love to wear my neckless. It makes me feel good and up lifting.
0,"My boyfriend purchased the Heart Pendant on the sation pink cord last year sometime. I wore it maybe 2 times and it broke. the cord came completely out of the clasp. He fixed it for me, then the clasp broke. I would not recommend buying this necklace. From what i see, others have had the same problems as I have. ~Amanda"
1,I love paris hilton !!! She is just soo cute and funn and entergetic. I love this necklace it is soo cute.!!!! I LOVE YOU PARIS!!!!!!!
0,"I really like this, but cannot order this as it will not ship here to Canada.................grrr"
1,"This necklace is great. The satin cord is so trendy, and the heart is very pretty with the pink diamonds.I am only 13 years old and plan to get all the other pieces most likely the star necklace and earings. Maybe if I get my belly button pierced in the future I'll get the belly button piece. Anyway the price was right too!"
1,"This pendant arrived on time as promised in nice packaging, and it is absolutely gorgeous!!! I love it! The chain was not very pretty, but durable, so I purchased a really nice rope chain to put the pendant on, and I get lots of comments and compliments on the medallion! Just my style. Thanks!!!"
1,"These earrings are the perfect size, not too big to be gaudy, but enough to dress up my ears for work, and very pretty. I also bought the ""sapphire"" ones too, and plan to get the ""ruby"" ones. You cannot beat the price $3.95 per pair, definitely worth it!"
1,Gave them to my niece who just recently pierced her ears. She loves them because they're small and delicate looking.
1,These are a five star rating because they are a good price I liked them because they were small would recommend to anyone.
1,"I bought these for my girlfriend expecting cheap costume jewelry and for what they are they're a beautiful shade of blue, fairly decent sized, and have great fire. If you're considering a small gift for a special lady, this is a great buy."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these earrings considering their low price. They truly sparkle, shimmer and shine! On the pair I received, the purple seems to be paler than the pictures show, but they are still lovely earrings. The back that holds the earring in place seems very small, but actually with the smaller size, they are comfortable when sleeping. I also ordered the emerald pair, and they are just as lovely. The green on the emerald pair is much darker than the purple is on the amethyst pair. I'm pleased with the purchase, and will look for them in other colors and shapes."
0,I THOUGHT THE OVERALL QUALITY WAS VERY POOR. I DID NOT GIVE THIS TO MY WIFE AND JUST DUMPED IT.
0,"Purchased this ring as a Christmas gift. After receiving the wrong ring from the seller, and not having it in time for Christmas was already annoyed with it. Finally received the correct ring almost 3 weeks after the initial contact from the seller saying the correct ring would be sent. Was upset in the quality, or lack there of. I have owned several spinner rings, and this one does not match up. First, the inside ring that the spinner sits in is not a solid band. It has vertical openings throughout it therefore not making it very sturdy. The ring was accidentally dropped the first week she wore it, and the spinner stopped. Looking at the ring it was clear the inside ring had bent slightly. After attempting to stretch and shape it back, the ring would spin slightly, but not freely as it should. Overall, a very disappointing purchase. It has the potential to be an awesome ring, but the shortcut on silver in the inside band truly deteriorates the quality. I would not recommend making this purchase."
0,"This ring is made of the cheapest ""silver"" known to man... it leaves your finger black within minutes of putting it on. These days, silver is usually at LEAST coated to protect the wearer from that ""oh so icky"" black tarnish that can form on the skin under the ring. No such luck with this piece of crap. Not only did it leave the ""attractive"" black as soot band around my finger, one of the rings I ordered (I ordered three for myself, my girlfriend and our ""gay supporter"" roomie) was defective in that the band that is supposed to spin, wouldn't budge without great force. So, at the risk of sounding redundant, this ring, is crap. Go buy something that has at least the coating on it to protect your finger from the appearance of blackrot!"
1,i got this ring for my ex because when we were together i sent her a picture and it was supoose to be a promise ring...anyways it fit nice once she got it wet it spung and she played with it for a long time. her face lit up when i gave it to her. she loves it so much. i still had to get it for her.
1,I bought 2 rings as a celebration of our 25th Christmas together! They are quite lovely and interesting. The Rainbow Peace design was the perfect gift for our anniversary! Thank you!
1,I have made many orders from Company and ALL have been WONDERFUL... This Ring is exceptional.... Colors are vivid and sizing was perfect.
0,"This is a well made item, the only disappointment was that there was very little 'rainbow' effect from the stones, certainly nowhere near what is shown in the picture. I bought both necklace and earrings and this lack of rainbow effect was in all three stones."
1,these earring are beautiful and go great with the necklace. if you like celtic than these are a must have.
1,"I ordered these earrings for my British stepdaughter who was going to be visiting her mother in Florida just after Christmas because I couldn't find them in England. She was delighted, so therefore, so am I. I haven't seen them yet, but my wife-in-law said they came in a pretty box and they looked very good. And the price was very good indeed at under $100"
0,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.WHEN I ORDERED IT IT BROKE EASILY.I PROMISE I AM NOT LYING.ALSO THEY ARE NOT EXTRA LARGE.BE SURE NOT TO BUY.
1,"Bracelet is beautiful, almost like a bangle it is so wide. There are a lot prongs and that is my only concern is losing a stone. But right now it is taking my breadth away. I use to work for Zales and it looks very well made. Well worth the money"
0,"Was looking for cute & dainty earings for every day. They are very cute but tiny in person. They are depicted as being much bigger than they actually are on website pics...The price was right, so am not at all disappointed."
1,My wife was looking for earrings to were around the house when she wasn't wearing any other jewelry. She loves these. Attractive but not gaudy.
1,"These earrings are so perfect I have no plans to take them out. I had been shopping for tiny hoop earrings for at least a year, but I never saw what I wanted. Everything I examined was too big or looked like it would hurt when I slept in them or they'd get caught on the towel when I dried my hair. Recently, I thought of looking at childrens' earrings and began my search with Amazon, not really expecting to find anything. I ordered these on a chance; things rarely look the same in hand as they do online, but the return policy was generous (no 20% restocking fee). Less than a week later, I received earrings that are remarkably sturdy for their diminutive size, were barely noticeable when I slept, and did not snag on the towel.The only negative aspect to the endless hoop design is that they were incredibly hard to put in with my big, adult fingers! I spent almost 15 minutes struggling on my own until I enlisted a helper. But they are now snugly in place and look perfect. Wish these were available in white gold or platinum!"
0,I bought this for my daughter but she did not get to wear it at all. The hoops are so tiny and the lock is so cumbersome that I could not even put it on her. I had to return them.
1,I saw these on Mamzon and had to have them. I purchased four Eve's addiction products and was overwhelmed with the quality for the price. Heavy weight and very sparkly and thier styles are very feminine. I will continue to purchase thier products in the future.
1,I bought one for myself and 4 more for female relatives. We belong to a Mardi Gras Krewe and I got these for us to wear to the balls and various other dressy functions. They're beautiful!!
1,this came as promised and was really nice. I absolutely love them and wear them all the time.I recommended them to friends their site.
0,"I was very happy with this product in terms of size, color & quality all being as described. I was looking for a pair of earrings to wear day in and day out, without poking me while sleeping. These earrings serve that function well with 1 exception"
1,"Came in the mail way sooner than expected, perfect timing for mothers day, beautiful bracelet and for the price I wouldn't dare complain, I would recommend this to any jewelry lover, great small gift, I WILL PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER AGAIN! =)"
1,"I got this as my first charm bracelet, along with some charms, and they were great. Its a good price, and it came very fast in the mail."
1,"This was to replace a bracelet my daughter lost when one of the links broke. It is identical with one exception, it is a much better quality. The materials are stronger, the links are incredible. Very pleased."
0,"I purchased these as a gift for my mother. She saw them on Amazon andasked that I buy them for her. She ended up returning them because thepost did not seem secure. It did not extend deep enough into the hollowhoop end, and seemed as though the earring would fall out of the ear prettyeasily."
1,These are simply beautiful earrings! Very comfortable and stylish. They can be worn for any occasion. I get many compliments on them.
1,"I purchased this necklace as a gift for my 14 year-old-granddaughter. She absolutely loved it. All of the retro look clothes made the silk cord ""chain"" a hit. The drop itself is lovely. The peridot is well cut and of beautiful color; the freshwater pearl is substantial size and very pretty."
1,"I ordered this necklace as a gift for my sister. It came when it was supposed to, and it looks absolutely beautiful! I'm sure she will love it! It is exactly what I wanted."
1,I love these earrings. They make me feel like a Spanish senorita. The backs for the posts are bigger and sturdier than your run-of-the-mill backs. Very nice.
1,"If one is considering the purchase of this ring, hesitate no longer. My Iron Cross ring arrived quickly, safely/well packaged, plus, the ring is even better than advertised. Sabrina Silver, thank you.JF"
1,"Prettier than in picture! Very lovely, good quality and looks great on- my sister wore it as my maid of honor w/ a red dress at my wedding and it was perfect! I am very happy w/ this product."
1,"I bought this as a gift for a friend and she was very pleased with it. She says it's very delicate and girlie like, just like in the pic! I'm so happy she loved it!"
1,i am very pleased with my whole shopping experience the item was just as described it was shipped very fast ...perfect
0,"My son bought this from my wish list as an early Christmas gift..within the first hour of wear, it fell off my wrist!I thought the clasp came open, it actually broke between where the flowers/crystals meet and sadly could not be fixed."
0,"My grandmother gave this to me last year, and I loved it. It tarnished quickly, and when I tried to clean it, the black coloring in the word engraving came off. Pretty bracelet in the box."
1,Bought several of these bracelets for Christmas gifts! They were a big hit! Perfect for someone who need a little pick me up!
0,"Unfortunately the clasp was too large for me to slip on the pendant. My other wonder is why it wasn't packaged as a circle, instead of it being folded. Didn't make sense."
0,"I bought this item for use with a necklace pendant, and it works great for the purpose. But I've had it for about 3 months now, and the clasp is wearing out, and a couple of times I've had it randomly come off because the chain links were slipping out of the clasp. I tend to fiddle with the necklace a lot though, and I wear it constantly. So if it's something you're only going to wear occasionally, then this is will work great! Otherwise, I suggest maybe finding something a little sturdier."
0,"works for its purpose, but it looks a bit cheap to me...not that happy with it.."
1,The anklet was just as I saw pictured and arrived on the scheduled time frame. I was very pleased with the product and the delivery.
1,This were for my husband I told him he would love them and he did. I got them for his birthday. The others were hurting his ears. These were perfect for him Thanks Debi
0,"While this is a very nice looking ring it is not real sterling silver. I've had it for less than a few days and it's already started to turn my finger green. It is stamped with 925 on the inside, but it surely is not. The inside of the ring is already starting to 'wear' off. Very disappointing because I would have been more than willing to spend a few extra dollars on this to get a REAL STERLING SILVER RING. Buyers if you are looking for real solid sterling silver, don't waste your money here. I'm going to be very reluctant to purchase anything else from this seller.NOTE"
0,"Watch out, buyers--this ring is NOT sterling silver. It turned my finger green in less than 24 hours. I love the design; it's very unique, but it is not what it has been advertised as. I had to use the clear nail polish method to keep it from turning my finger green. If you want a cool ring that is not actual silver, then this is the ring for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,"The ring is exactly as pictured. Great item, very pleased the company and the delivery."
1,Love this ring. It arrived quickly and well packaged. It fits exactly and looks great!
0,"I was not at all happy with this ring when it arrived. It did not look at all like the picture, but flatter and rougher around the edges. Please note that the braiding does not go all the way around. This is clear in the picture, but I did not notice before I ordered it. Also, the sizing was a bit on the small side."
1,"It's pretty. A little heavier than I'd like, but it's sturdy and well made. I have been wearing it more and more."
1,Product was purchased as a gift and it was exactly what I ordered. It arrived sooner than expected too.Thank you.
1,"I am really impressed with this belly ring. It looks even better in person than it does on-line, which is pretty rare these days."
1,"I was very much pleased with the selection choices, the price, and the quick shipment."
1,"I ordered this ring as a gift for myself. It is exactly like the picture and just as beautiful. I love antique style rings and fell in love with this one when I saw it. I get compliments about this ring all the time. The ring arrived on time and carefully packaged. The ring itself is very sturdy. I have had it for a few months now, and have worn it everyday since receiving it,(even to work). I work in retail, and I am constantly moving and using my hands. It never gets caught on anything, which is something I was concerned because of the bottom of the heart. Even after all this time there are barely any scuff marks."
0,I wanted to replace my wifes belly button ring and this did the trick for a couple years before the rose started chipping.
1,I love my pearl pendant. It's a good size and it looks expensive. Good for the price.
1,This ring is nice and larger than it appears I have no complaint if your thinking about buying it the price is rite.
1,"I read reviews all the time, I never buy anything unless someone can tell me something about it. So this point of view is from someone who really takes time to read reviews.I ordered the ring box on Oct. 1st and decided to go with fast shipping just in case... it arrived on Oct. 5th. So the package arrived in perfect condition and on time. They also tracked the package and I had to sign for it. Which that isn't necessarily important, but being that I needed the box before Oct. 7th, my mind was at ease knowing where the package was.Someone else wrote a review and said...""it's a box and does what it needs to"". That's exactly it. It looks very similar to the picture except the inside is a little bit lighter. Good box, if you need a box.The End."
0,The ox is just what its states the box will be...if you wanna be freakin WOWed than no but if you want an nice clean simple box then this is it.
1,"I'm very happy with the jewelry box...When I ordered this item, I was going back and forth between another jewelry box and I definitely made the right choice. For those of you in the same predicament, here's my take"
1,I bought this box for an engagement ring. I didn't want to display the diamond in a box with a jewelery store logo inside the lid.It was shipped fast and I was very happy with the quality of this box. Its a deep brown/red with a high gloss finish. The inside is a very nice white leather or leatherette material. The box made a huge impression before it was even opened. Very pleased.
0,its a nice ring but be sure to get the right size! mine was too small. the rim digs into your skin. you might even want a size bigger than you usually get.
0,"These earrings would have been lovely if they had consistent quality. The gold detailing on one earring is quite heavy, but very complete, while the gold detailing on the other is extremely light and messy. Was going to give these as a gift, but not now - I've seen nicer looking things from the dollar store."
1,"Very nice earrings! My sister-in-law loved them. Came quickly, packaged in a nice box. Overall, good purchase. They were a good size - not too big, not too small."
1,"This is a beautiful find, and what a deal! The pendant looks exactly as it does in the picture. Very happy with my choice here!"
0,Cute ring but the silver is so thin that it broke within 2 days of wearing it. Low quality item.
1,"I received these earrings as a gift and they're even more beautiful in person. Furthermore, they are well-priced for the quality."
1,"got this for the boys to give ""mom"" on her day. she loved the earrings. looked like good quality. when i opened the box they looked really small. but when the wife put them on, they are just the right size. guess if you don't wear earrings it's tough to gauge what size is good."
0,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift. I would be embarassed to give this to someone. The heart was mis-shaped and flawed with rough edges and uneven finish. Will not exchange as I feel the quality is so poor. It is not stamped .925. It is stamped ""Sterling"". Very disappointed."
1,"These earrings are so cute! They are a great size for a toddler, but probably a little large for a small infant. It is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute. These are a beautiful rose pink color - very sweet."
0,This item is very pretty just like in the picture but in the description it says it fits 1ct diamond earrings and it doesn't. I had to return this item because it didn't fit my 1ct diamond earrings. Great item but wrong description. The Amazon customer service representative was very nice on the phone and I received free return shipping. It has been a week and I am waiting for my credit card to be refunded.
1,this and all other jewelry order ed came as expected snd eveyone loved them
0,"i was hoping for a bright red or really dark red, but they are more of a magenta color, but they are nice"
1,I recommened u all buy these earrings there so pretty. And there cheap for the price. Its worth it. What you expect for this price 6.21bucks. Its worth every penny. I wear them everyday. I also get complaments on my earrings to.
0,"The medal looks nice, but unfortuantely it appears that it is hollow....it defintiely has a funny sound because of it!I wish I had known that before I ordered it."
1,Received it before I was suppose to. My daughter loves it. Would buy from them again and have they have some very nice belly rings. Was very happy with the sale and the product
0,"When I bought them, I didn't expect them to be so big. That is my fault and although I've grown to love them, they are a bit too big for everyday wear."
0,This belly ring is pure junk and the company sucks. They won't contact you back for anything. It fell apart after two days.
1,"These earrings are a fantastic addition to my little collection. I love how they dangle, but not in a flashy or obtrusive way. They look great with casual and professional attire. A must have!"
1,I'm very impressed with this bracelet and very happy with augustina jewelry handling. I would recommend this bracelet to others.
1,"The seller of these pearls was fantastic to work with. There was a problem to where I wanted the pearls sent, but the seller reshipped me a new product at no extra charge. I would definitely order from them again! Not to mention, the pearls were beautiful!"
1,"Even though these are Lever backs I have lost one every now and again which makes me very sad. However, Jesus seems to make sure you eventually find the lost soul. I get tons of compliments when I wear these ear rings. Please get more in stock. I want another pair."
1,"I've bought the earring to my mom and she is absolutely satisfied with the purchase. They look beautiful , they aren't too small, the blue topaz looks great, it's sparkling. I would recommend to buy the earrings."
1,"I got 2 of these for my two flowergirls. They loved them. They aren't very expensive, and the quality is good, they were packaged nicely. And there is also a bigger version which I got for my maid of honor and my mother."
1,I bought this as a gift for my niece who was the flower girl at my wedding. She loved it and at almost 3 years old kept saying pretty! I hope she will have it for many years to come - maybe use it as her something old one day or pass it on to her flower girl........
1,this is so beautiful and I did receive it in time for Christmas.. my niece love it and it was just perfect
0,"While I was specifically looking for this exact charm and was delighted to find it, I am less than thrilled with how long it has lasted. The pink little girls dress fell off of the gold girl charm in less than two weeks. While the charm still looks presentable and no one can tell unless they look really closely, it was a disappointment."
1,My mom loved the pendant but I wish a chain went with it to complete its beauty
1,I purchased this ring after shopping around and looking at several different ones. And I love this one! It is super thick and the design is faint but yet detailed. I have been very happy with it!
1,"I ordered the ring at size 10 and it fit perfectly. The Surgical Steel 8mm Autism Awareness Jigsaw Puzzle Wedding Band Ring Matte Background, size 10 was exactly as described."
1,I got just what I ordered with this ring. The picture looks just like what I got. The size is not as off as some of the reviews seemed to say but I'm completely happy with what I got. I love it!
1,"This ring is exactly what I wanted. There are embossed puzzle pieces all around the ring. Giving it a 2-dimensional look. It does come smaller in size, so if your an 8, I suggest getting a 9 instead. Other than that, it's a very nice ring."
1,"I Love this Cleaner IT really Does a Good Job on Very Delicate or Fine Jewelery and does a good detailed job on heavier less ornate pieces as well. Simple to use.And Also Easy enough to use your favorite Store brand or Home-made cleaner in the Unit.A solution of Windex and Water mix Seems to Do Best for us in this cleaner! Cheap, EASY and Safe solution If You Run out of solution or it does not come with a cleaner.Good Unit! A+++"
1,I'm VERY happy with this belly ring!!! I suggest it for anyone who's thinking about getting 1
1,There isnt much i can say about this item just that the picuture doesnt do the item justice and the seller was great to deal with easy transaction and no problems!
1,"This is a very nice ring, I bought one for a gift and decided to keep it myself and ordered another"
1,I wore these earrings for my wedding. I chose them because I could see myself wearing them again and again. They were extremely light weight and laid perfectly the whole night. I got a ton of compliments on them and I loved the fact that I was able to find a pair of green and silver pair of earrings. You'll love these.
0,"Before buying this piece, take careful note of the listed information about the product. The grade is I2-I3, which is the last step before the diamond is broken up into tiny pieces for cheap jewelry at Wal-Mart or ground up into industrial abrasives. The color is at a level just barely acceptable for ""white"" jewelry.In one respect, you do have to give the seller some credit for honesty. I can't imagine they are inflating the specifications that much for stones that bad. However, this piece gets one star for that joke of a list price. It simply is not realistic, and is listed solely to make you think you are getting a ""good deal."" If anybody ever actually paid that price, they might as well have been robbed. I know that inflated ""list prices"" are common in the jewelry industry, but this one takes the cake!SirWired"
1,I bought two of these for my nieces and they absolutley adored them. They are delicate with a beautiful sparkling effect. The proportion is appropriate for a young girl.
1,The shape of the pin is very realistic . However its bright blue colour is unexpected adding a humorous note to it.
1,I purchased these earrings for my 10 year old niece. They are very beautiful and the perfect size for a young adult.
1,"I love this bracelet so much! It arrived on time (early, even) and looks great with everything! Totally classy and shiny!"
1,This was a wonderful Christmas gift. The locket is big enough to fit a perfect picture in it. It was a great buy
0,"This ring was so beautiful. This ring was a MONSTER sitting on my finger. Sent it back. 5 STARS to the company for IMMEDIATE refund. They were wonderful. Would absolutely purchase from them again, without hesitation. I will read the DESCRIPTION better next time!"
1,"Bought this on ""Today's Deals"" and was very satisfied with the size and appearance. Chain is lightweight but the pendant is good quality."
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my bracelet that the quality of the pearls and leather exceeded my expectations based on the price. The bracelet is very comfortable to wear and the pearls have a wonderful lustre. This bracelet definitely holds it's own against the higher-priced, name-brand version!"
0,This purchase was my most disappointing purchase ever! It's not Sterling Silver and it's Chinese Turquoise. It's also not real leather. So it's worth about $5 and is selling for 5 times that much. I do NOT recommend this product!
1,"This arrived in 2 days- amazing customer service. I bought 2 of these pregnancy rings to use as barbells for my industrial piercing, and they're great. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a unique barbell to wear in an industrial/scaffolding piercing, as well as to any pregnant woman looking to preserve her navel piercing. Great product!"
1,This was definitely a great purchase. I love it. It has a very smooth setting and it is unique because of the setting. I wear it very often. The peridot has great color and the size is very comfortable. Definitely consider this item!
1,"Very Beautiful and very believable. Super comfortable. I am actually going to purchase a second band, to flank the other side of my wedding band!"
1,"I bought this as a ""Right hand"" ring. It is well made and very sparkly. I've had it for awhile now and it still looks as nice as the day I got it. Also it is thin enough to use as a bangle or stack ring."
1,really cute and came in adorable box. I didn't even have to gift wrap. cam=e in the mail almost instantly.
1,Beautiful pair of hoops however do not indicate if solid or hollow nor the gram weight therefore very difficult to make a decision on purchase.
0,"In browsing the jewelry section of amazon.com, I came across what appeared to be a great deal . . . this Floating Heart Pendant with Diamond by Samuel Jewelers. The online image looked lovely and the thought of a diamond and white-gold combination for under $50 was very appealing. I purchased the item. . . . I received the necklace earlier today and I must say, I am VERY disappointed with it. The piece is much smaller than I thought it would be -- diamond is practically invisible, the white-gold chain itself isn't at all elegant or eye-appealing, and because the chain is so delicate, thin, it makes it very difficult to put on and remove the necklace. Do not waste your money on this. Buy your girl/woman a dozen roses instead!"
1,"I bought this pendant and necklace set for my mother and she's going to love it. Gold and diamonds for under $50? You can't find this kind of deal in the mall jewelery stores; I looked! I expected the diamond to be teensy, but it looks like a bigger carat weight than is listed. I was pleasantly surprised. This is just the special gift I was looking for and it fit my budget."
1,"So, my really good friend is getting married - at a casino. My dress is classic vintage 50's - think Lauren Bacall - perfect. These earrings are the pefect compliment and everything I was looking for! They are stunning, and arrived safely in a little ziploc jewelry bag, inside a velvet jewelry bag - nice detail. I was a little nervous about buying earrings online, and am really excited that I'm not disappointed. Definitely will consider this vendor for future earring purchases."
1,"This belly ring is of good quality and has a nice color. I highly recommend BodyCandy body jewelry - I have purchased many beautiful, quality products from them."
1,"I bought these when they were on sale. I wasn't expecting much I just wanted a pair of earrings and they were on sale. They are amazingly lovely! They just shine and the color is beautiful. The silver isn't really thin, I don't know what that review is really referring to. I love these earrings! Most certainly worth what I paid and then some."
1,I've had this ring for well over a year now and I still get compliments at least once a week. It is a beatiful ring that you will not see anyone else with.
1,"When I received my order I noticed the tags had scratches. I contacted the seller and within a few days, they shipped me out new ones free of charge. Response time to my request was prompt. Customer service was wonderful. Highly recommend."
1,"This product coems eactly as show. The item contains silenccers, chain, and tags. The item does not come pre-assembled, and needs to be assembled. the tags come blank and need to be engraved. the chain is not long enought ot fit over the head of an average adult. Assembly is not ahassle if one knows what to do."
0,"I bought this for some chick I was seeing, I thought it would be a nice little necklace, it turned out to be larger than I thought. In case you date Sasquach stay away."
1,This is a beautiful shade of Amazonite and receives many compliments. The size of the bead makes them stand out without being overpowering. Another beautiful product from SilverSpeck.
1,This item came to me in the mail so quick and I appreciate the excellent service. I have purchased items from you in the past
1,"I dropped by to read a few reviews of one of my Amazon Friends and this belly ring caught my eye first! NO ... It's not for me. Too old for that kind of stuff, (I would get laughed out of town!), but I thought it would be good for Shelli's belly. Shelli's my granddaughter and she has a variety of these rings--and she likes red--so I think she'll like this one.I gave it a five-star for color and design. I'll let you know how Shelli likes it, but not till after Christmas ... It's one of her Christmas gifts."
1,"This is for a gift, perfect for a dainty friend. Colors are as shown, nice quality and design."
0,"Although I have enjoyed the anklet, the color is now ""gold-tone"" rather than silver. I received the anklet as a gift last Christmas (a year). It would not seem to be actual sterling. I don't really enjoy it as much as I once did. I am disappointed in the lasting quality."
0,This is a beautiful ankle bracelet. The colors are lovely and go with most every outfit. The ankle bracelet is comfortable and can be sized. It is a great piece of jewelry for any age. The item arrived on time and was wonderfully packaged. A terrific item and it comes from a consistently great seller.
1,I have big girl legs and need something a little longer to be comfortable and this was perfect. It's nicer then the picture..very light and shiny.
1,"This bracelet is so pretty, delicate, yet sturdy, well made, yet comfortable. It was so reasonably priced I was not sure what to expect, but it is very pretty, and the entire process was positive. I will definetly be a repeat customer and recommend them to my friends."
1,"When the anklet arrived it was better than I expected. Even though the chain looks delicate once placed on my ankle, it really stands out and draws one's eye right to it. Also, I've had it for a month and have never broken it, which is amazing since I never take it off. I even wear it in the shower, and it still keeps it's shine. It was a great buy!"
1,"Love this anklet, looks great and well made. Wear all the time. Looks like it cost more. Would buy again definitely."
1,"I had been looking online for an anklet and came across this one. The reviews were good and so was the price so I placed my order. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I haven't taken it off since I got it (probably a week now). No problems showering with it on and it doesn't get caught on anything like others I have worn. If you are looking for a beautiful, simple but elegant anklet you will not be disappointed with this one."
1,Anklet is very feminine and very attractive. Great little chain for the price. I wear it everyday.Thanks Gem Ave!
1,Received this order in short amount of time. Item just as pictured. Was very pleased with transaction.
1,Very Pretty Ring. Wear it on my index finger. I chose this ring because I thought it was unusual and not something you see every day.
1,"Got this to wear on index finger, looks great, especially for price. Also got bracelet to match. Look nice together, although bracelet stones a bit small for me."
1,I have not taken this item off since receiving it..I get compliments about it always...Love..Highly recommend..for the price as well.
1,I love the teardrop design and the three shades of amber in this sterling silver ring. It's exactly what I expected it to be.
0,The ring is okay. Wish the stones were set more contoured to your finger. The fact they're not make the product seem cheap.
0,"I tried to return this because it turned colors. I was very disappointed that they chose not to help me. I wanted to order one for my classmate but after this experience, I'll be looking for it from somewhere else."
1,"a really lovely pair of earrings - larger than I expected, but not too big. An excellent value that matches an amber pendant I have."
1,Had a bracelet like this in the early 80's lost it over the years. I wanted to replace it and so I did. I really have enjoyed wearing this bracelet as much as my original one.
1,"This is a heavy, solid ring, suitable for office wear yet glamorous enough for evening. The pav&eacute; diamonds are understated and the sapphire fits within the width of the band.The sapphire is very dark, with very little ""fire,"" which undoubtedly contributes to the low price. At the ""full price"" listed for this piece (which would be a major outlay) I would probably lower this rating. However, at the ""closeout price"" (similar to a plain band ring in platinum) it made a great gift.Kudos to Secure Hoop, who went out of their way to devise a very nice gift wrap and to assure delivery."
1,"This is a beautiful necklace and fairly weighty. The chain is nothing spectacular, but the pendant is the important part anyway. It was slightly smaller than I had thought it would be, but with the heaviness, that is a good thing. I became interested in owning this item after reading a book edited by Sorita D'Este entitled Hekate"
1,"Wow. This is one of my all-time favorite bracelets. I wear it every single day. The bracelet itself is very flexible, and you don't feel that you have to struggle to put it on. It has a watch feel but without the face. I love it."
1,"I purchased 2 of these bracelets; one for a gift and the other for myself. My friend's BD isn't until May, but I'm not going to hold off giving it to her. I want to wear mine now. As another review or two mentioned, the bracelet looks much more expensive than it is. It feels very comfortable to wear (very important to me) and can be adjusted because it's a true buckle...6 different settings. The smaller settings would even fit a little girl. The mesh doesn't have any sharp points like some mesh can. I'm thinking of ordering some more; this may be my go-to gift for 2013. Also, I ordered this on a Friday at 8 PM Eastern and received it on Monday via standard (free!) shipping. Thanks, Sabrina Silver!"
1,"I love it! I have another bracelet that I had for about four years that unfortunately broke, so I was looking for something like an upgrade. I liked that this bracelet was simple and clean like sterling silver tends to be, but still has the unique belt-buckle touch that adds a nice addition to it. It's stylish without being obnoxious and it fits very well. Plus, I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday, which is saying something considering the Holiday Rush I ordered it during. Even Amazon didn't realize it shipped so soon!?"
1,"I got this as to give as a little present. It is a really nice item, especiallyfor the price. It looks great on my Lady! She says it is comfortable andhas gotten several compliments on it at the office."
1,"The picture simply doesn't do the earrings justice - they are just so delicate and elegant! I'd bought the same kind of earrings, but with topazes, when I decided to get these as a birthday present for my grandma. They'll look just as good on a 70 year old as they do on a teen!I recommend buying the matching pendant [...] - this would be the perfect gift for everyone with a thing for peridots!"
1,"i received this as a gift from my wishlist, and it looks 10 times lovlier in person! everytime i wear it (which is often) i get loads of compliments on it! :)"
1,"Simple and thin, yet sturdy and elegant. It's much lighter than my previous chain; so light that I don't really feel it when it's on. Clasp was easy to fasten as well. I would recommend this for anyone who needs or wants a chain for any small pendants."
1,"Chain is made with attention, got very good quality and details. Is delicate but knots are strong enough. Lock is proper.Very nice beautiful product.Thank you"
1,I found this product to be of high quality and very attractive. The length was perfect for me and it fit the charm I had purchased as if it were made for it. Would highly recommend this product.
1,"This chain is exactly what I wanted to go with the Celtic Knot I bought from Gem Avenue.It is well made, sturdy, very shiny and attractive. If you like sterling silver, you'll love this chain. You get to pick the length you want to buy and Gem Avenue always sends their products in beautiful packaging. For you or ready to give as a gift. The price is great too...Enjoy!"
1,"For the drastically reduced price, I was expecting something middle-of-the-road, but...this necklace blew me away! It was exactly what I wanted and needed for displaying my many pendants. A well-crafted chain made of sterling silver at an unbeatable price, a pretty piece of jewelry that classes up any outfit...you can't go wrong with this piece."
1,"I ordered the 30"" chain and it's beautiful. Perfect length! I'm actually ordering another today, along with a shorter length. Highly recommend this product and seller. Shipping was fast and secure. The silver is a beautiful quality. Very happy!"
1,I truly love that chain. Just beautiful. I bought one for my sister & nephew. It only took a couple of days to get them.
0,Too small to fit around my boyfriends neck. However the shipping was great. arrived before the estimated date
1,I ordered this figaro chain for a tiny charm I purchased at a jewelry show. This chain is much prettier and priced less than I could buy at the show. I love this link design - this is a fantastic buy! The chain arrived promptly as noted in the description. It is very nicely polished. It is also marked sterling which is what I wanted to purchase. I was surprised at how beautiful the chain is when it arrived! I will buy from this vendor again in the future.
1,"This is a very pretty little chain. I first bought the 3mm one, which was very nice, but looked more masculine then the smaller chain. I would recommend either of them. Nicely made and wears beautifully."
1,"So often truly unique crosses are too large for everyday wear--this one is the perfect size, and has all the colors of my wardrobe, so it matches everything. The quality and workmanship is excellent. It's a treasured piece in my jewelry box."
1,"I ordered a sterling silver BB Ball chain from Amazon.com, and boy did it come in quick! Thanx a lot! I Am One Satisfied customer!"
1,This product really is cool. My friends loved it when I showed them and I love it. Shipped fast and no problems with it. Now my friend wants one too.
1,"This chain has had so many compliments. I have been having it for about three months, and it has never tarnished!! If you want a diamond horseshoe like some celebrities have but can't afford the price, this one will have everyone fooled!Who says you have to tell them the actual price?"
1,"I brought this for my daughter, I had purchased another ball chain that was much thinner for a pendant I brought for her at a very well known expensive company. The first chain broke the day I gave them to her. I brought this chain, it looks perfect with the sterling silver pendant I brought her and she loves it! Thank you so much."
1,"This is one of my favorite pieces in my collection. It is gorgeously detailed for such a small figurine, and the diamond cuts give it a nice sparkle. The little dragon looks like a baby, and the wizard looks kind. Love it!"
1,"My doughter loves the earrings, she gets a lot of complements from her friends.Very happy with the product and the price."
0,"Came in a plain box with a swath of cotton, no certificate, no 14 k tag,no notes or letter. For all I know, they could be a light platting or even used jewelry."
0,"These are very nice shiny, perfect-sized earrings for the $12.50 I paid. HOWEVER, be warned, the backs to these are VERY small - TINY. I have never seen earring backs so small in my life. It took me 10 minutes to get them both in, and my ear lobes are red. I have long nails, so I imagine it would be easier for someone who does not."
1,To those who feel the 7mm are too big; they are not. To those who feel the quality may be marginal; the quality is superior.I have worn them for several months straight - never removing them and they have fully met my expectations. I recommend them without reservation.
0,"I was a little disspointed the earrings were hollow and the backs very small. However, for the price still can not beat it."
1,I like the simplicity of these earrings.White Gold - Classic - From formal occasions to Jeans...A great present for that special occasion. For young and old.
1,You'll never go wrong when you gift gold. Traditional ball earrings are always well received. I buy several pairs at a time (when on special) and keep for handy last minute gifts.

1,"Wear them 24/7 several weeks in a row and am very happy with the quality, the 7mm size, and of course-Amazon's bargains!Try the 7mm Yellow Gold Ball Earrings...you will love them too!"
0,"Good size. The back fell off so I'm hoping this isn't a problem. Not sure if it was loose, or something I did. Earrings are nice otherwise."
1,I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift for my wife and they look great. My wife has long dark hair and the 7mm (larger than a 1/4 inch) size really stands out. They came in a dark blue velvet jewel/ring box which comes in another dark blue box. My wife really loves them so that's a bonus for me. They are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift.
1,They are beautiful only the posts are short for my fat earlobes. Pleased with my purchase over all. Now l need the next smaller size for the 2nd holes
0,"love them but lost the back today, as others have stated was not a tight fit. The ear ring is perfect for the price."
1,I have two sets of holes and I wear these every day in my back holes. I wanted something a little nicer for the office but not diamonds because I knocked them out answering the phone. These have never come out and look great.
1,"These earrings go with just about anything, and are a fantastic quality! The perfect alternative to pearls..."
1,"I wear these earrings almost every day. They go great with jeans, work clothes and with an evening gown alike, with white or yellow gold, silver & costume jewelry. They are comfortable to wear and beautiful."
0,"I like how these look, but they are difficult to clasp when you put them on. They're also easy to bend because the metal is pretty thin."
1,"This is a very pretty item, I purchased it as a stocking stuffer for my wife, so she hasn't seen it yet. However, I have no doubt that she will love it. I tried it on a silver chain and it sparkles, very pretty!"
1,This item is very pretty and looks hand made. I bought it as a gift for a friend. I recommend it!
1,"What a great value! Pugster makes quality brooches, and if you have the patience to view their enormous inventory, you can find beautiful pieces that are a joy to give and to wear - at exceptionally low prices."
0,"My boyfriend ordered this pendant for me for Valentine's Day. What they sent him is 5mm longer (leaving more space between the diamonds), and I think it's actually only .1 carat, rather than .15. Maybe they sent the wrong thing, or maybe they're being dishonest."
1,"I am totally happy with this ring display case! It's exactly what I wanted, was delivered quickly, and is of good quality. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an easy way to store, display and enjoy their rings!"
1,i have two of this holds my rings perfectly. everybody thinks that i sell rings lol but they are all mine great product
1,It's very elegantly lined with black velvety material and fits all my rings perfectly. The box itself is very well built. For me this is the perfect size to put my handful of rings in and it easily fits in my drawers. Love it and am looking forward to filling it out!
1,I am very very happy with this ring holder. It is so easy and convenient and nice looking.
1,"I was surprised at how fast the jewelry ring display case came. It was also great quality for the price. Very, very happy"
1,"I was very happy with this purchase. The ring box holds all my rings including a big bulky plastic fashion ring. Very good value for the price. Also Amazon.com is a favorite web site, great service and I have never been disappointed with any purchase!"
1,"I have four of these boxes. They hold up well and are convenient. However, thicker(3/4 in) rings won't fit. I've enjoyed mine."
1,"It's just what I expected...for the price it is *not* cheap looking, and it fits well (I have a very skinny arm so I have to push it up more but any bracelet is like that for me). It's stretchy, and the little charm seems stable enough on it. I'll be wearing it a lot =)"
1,Got this bracelet for my wife and she adores it and wears it all the time. The quote fits her life as it stands now and she is happy with it.
1,Item came on time and we just how I thought it would be. I am very happy with this purchase and how it was handled. :)
1,"I bought one for me I love it! Remind me how strong I need to be every day. In addition, I worked with women who has drug abuse issues and once I gave this as a tool to empower them do to their best."
0,"For the money, I expected this ring to be fairly high quality, but 3 of the side stones fell out in the first month of wearing. If you know a jeweler who can check the setting of each stone, and you really like the style, then get it. But have the jeweler check it out before you start wearing it."
1,"I irdered these earrings because they were cute and so reasonable in price. I had no idea they were going to be gorgeous! They are more delicate, shiny and lighter in color than they appear in the picture and just somehow look as if they sort of glow from inside. I put them on as soon as the arrived and when my husband came home he complemented me on them right away. Wonderful!"
1,"Pendant Flying Spaghetti Monster / B000GK25CUI've had my FSM necklace for over a year and couldn't be happier with it. Maybe I got lucky, but the chain that came with my emblem was sturdy and strong, and hasn't broken or tarnished or turned anything green yet. The emblem is exactly the right size, and is not so big as to look cheap or gaudy, but not so small as to be insignificant. I've noticed that non-pastafarians rarely notice the pendant, but good FSMers seem to see it right away and are often delighted to meet another pastafarian in the real world. I've very happy with my pendant and I recommend it highly.~ Ana Mardoll"
0,"I purchased this as a gift to my fiance as he recently took a job out of state. He loved the gift and initally I was very happy with the purchase. However, the second time I wore my half the chain(the smaller of the two) it completely snapped. I was very disappointed and am now searching for a replacement chain."
1,"I was looking and really had no monies to buy, but yet I was praying someway it would happen. When I saw this here GODLY piece I just knew it was perfect for us to share on her Birthday (1-26). A voice said you can get it check again. I had check my account before and did not see the monies. So I assume that what I had to check again, and OMG I had the monies in there. I did not know I still had monies because of my bills..I just give God the Glory for it all."
1,This is a beautiful symbol of loyalty and love. I purchased this for my husband for several reasons
0,This product is so cheaply made ...when i recieved the item the chain was all knotted up....not happy with this item at all.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it! It is so beautiful and so very special. The pendents are light in terms of their weight and the chains, though delicate in appearance, have a nice substantial feel to them. Highly recommend."
0,"I bought this necklace set for Christmas for my boyfriend and I. I love the set and I love the meaning behind it and almost everything about it. The charms are of excellent quality and the chains are too. I haven't had a problem with the chain getting dull or green, this is real silver. I have worn this necklace every single day through sleeping, showers, swimming and working with handsy babies. The reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because the link that holds the charm to the chain broke on both of our necklaces. I can't keep my hands off the necklace and was able to save mine. My boyfriend on the other hand could not. He is currently in Afghanistan right now and wasn't able to hear it drop to the floor like I did and it is likely he won't find it. I am sorely disappointed and he is too. He told me he really wanted to keep it as a keepsake to remind him of my love for him. :'(Overall, I do reccomend this product however, I suggest going to Michaels or a craft store and purchasing teeny tiny keychain loops to attach to the charm."
1,I am absolutely pleased with this product. It is exactly what I wanted. It is the perfect gift for your significant other while away.
1,I was very pleased with necklaces. Nice quality and everything was as expected as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of necklace.
1,"My husband and I are in love with our necklaces. The chain is nice and strong, without looking cheap, the charms are gorgeous. We have added our Christian crosses to the chain, and we haven't taken them off since we got them, and plan to wear them eternally. We got these because we had one before, but they were very chintzy compared to these and broke years ago.....and for the same price! We love amazon.com!"
1,"I ordered this product for my fianc&eacute;s and I because we weren't going to see one other for about 2 months. And I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Its not too big and its simple. I also like how the mens chain is a little longer. Plus the price is great. But yes, I would recommend this product to everyone."
1,I sent this to my wife as a gift while I am in Afghanistan. It got to her very quickly. She LOVES it! Thanks!
1,"We just recieved these, and the pictures on Amazon due not do these justice. They are alot better in person. the chains are true to length and the Mizbah is really a Fabulous looking piece. Great jewelry set and Great price.My wife and I have had a set of these for over 40 years of Marriage until we were robbed of them some time ago. So these are replacements but no doubt we both believe they are better than the originals. If you get a chance to buy these do so, They are well worth the Money."
0,"If I could give this zero stars I would. This Necklace was so small, my husband couldn't even read it. Also before I bought this, I didn't know it was Jewish. I am not Jewish, and neither is my husband. The Necklace was smaller than a penny. So you do the math-If a necklace is smaller than a penny,what size is the font?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?I would not get this if I were you."
0,"I definitely like this necklace a lot, but upon recieving it my wife and I quickly realized that it says :""..one from another"" rather than ""from one another.""Could be an easy mistake, but still a little aggrivating.I am sure it was an isolated incident, so that aside I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone!"
1,I got this necklace for my husband who is overseas right now. I wasn't sure what to expect with all the reviews. My expectations where low. But once I opened the package ALL my concerns were silenced. This necklace is just as described. The actual pendent IS small and delicate as the pictures show. The writing is very legible but very small. As shown! The chains are very heavy and of good quality (to me). I love this necklace! I am very satisfied.

0,I love the words because they're coming from god there are too small an you cannot see it i don't recommend thes
0,"I loved these when I bought them in February 2009, but sooner or later I will have to quit wearing them because I will loose the stone for good. The stone looks and feels secure, but when I least expect it, it drops out."
0,"The stone fell out of the setting the first time I wore it. Luckily I found the stone right away. I placed the ring and the stone in a small pocket in my purse as I had nothing else to store it in at the time.The ""gold"" setting was so flimsy that it bent out of shape while it was in my purse for a few hours."
0,"The heart was in excellent condition when it arrived, however, it was way smaller than I wanted. I would have loved it to be larger. It shows on the computer to be larger than it really was."
0,This thing is the size of a quarter! I wanted something about an inch or an inch-and-a-half wide that people can actually see and comment on!It is tiny and easily overlookable! RIP OFF!
1,"I was a bit hesitant on buying diamonds online, but I figured its Amazon and I have never had bad luck with Amazon so why not. I must say it was very well worth it. The packaging was really nice, but everything that came with the earrings made it that much more special. They are very bright and beautiful."
1,"I love these earrings. Opal is one of my favorite gemstones, and I wasn't diappointed in the slightest. They are a nice size; not real large, but the design and the fact that they are opals catch attention. They just dangle delicately and are very versitile. Sometimes your just in the mood to wear something that makes you feel pretty, and these will do just that."
1,This bracelet is beautiful and well worth the price. It arrived quickly after my order was placed and I'm very happy with the quality. Thank you!
0,"The length stated in the product description is 1.0"", however it is only .5"" length and .5"" width. It is very small. But I need it for a Christmas gift, so I'll keep it."
0,"This is a pretty bracelet, unfortunately the gold sparkles more than the diamonds do. They are of a low quality. Still I love the bracelet which was a gift from my boyfriend. He was even surprised at the size of the diamonds, the picture makes them look larger than they are - what you see is the illusion setting that they are in."
1,"Purchased this with the matching earrings. Nice color, shinny stones, delicate looking and looks expensive. Comes in a nice blue pouch."
1,"stones were smaller than expected but hey, its a 1/4ct. well cut stones and bright as well as the gold. overall worth more than the price. good steal ;)"
1,These were beautiful and as expected. They perfectly match a necklace my daughter has.
0,"My boyfriend purchased this ring for me for Xmas after looking through my wish list. I was ecstatic when he gave it to me and promptly put it on. Unfortunately, about a week later, the flimsy latch finally gave way after several attempts by me to keep the ring from suddenly popping open. I emailed the company right away to see if I could send it back for repair, and over a week later, have still not received a reply from them.I love this ring and will go to a local jeweler to see if the latch can be repaired, but am very upset that I have not heard back from Silver Insanity. I would definitely think twice before purchasing any of their products again."
1,This ring is beautiful and it fits perfect. I have small hands and it is nice to know I can now find a ring to fit me on amazon. I bought this ring to wear with my Halloween costume but I now find myself wearing it all the time.
0,"I wish they gave the measurements, it's not tiny as they look in the photo, too big."
1,"Which went very well with colored hemp, glass and wood bead combo. After the necklace was completed I sold it for a nice profit. The unique pendant not found in stores was an excellent selling point.Delivery was super fast."
1,"This necklace is just wonderful. It is feminine and sparkly without being too big or gaudy, and the length is just right, just a little bit longer than a choker. It is exactly what I was hoping for, I may even wear it at my wedding next summer!"
1,"I think these are really attractive, they go with everything, AND are a bargain for the price. They look much more expensive than they are because of the type of lever earring back. This makes them much more secure, too. I find myself reaching for them more and more often and often get compliments on them -- they provide just enough tasteful sparkle without being over the top."
1,Love these earrings. I have gotten many compliments on them. They are well made and go with every outfit I have.
1,These earrings are so pretty. I usually wear them for dress up because they seem a little fancier than the other Swarovski earrings I bought.
1,Dazzling Clear Swarovski Crystal Cube .925 Sterling Silver Leverback Drop EarringsI bought these earrings for myself. Crystals are the right size and a real eye catcher in the light. I would buy them again
1,These earrings are even more lovely than I imagined. I am completely satisfied with them! Great price and quality!!!
1,"These are my favorite crystal earrings. They look like ice crystals hanging from your ear. I wear them all the time and becuase of the crystal color, they match anything. I highly recommend these to anyone who likes sawarski crystal. These are magnificant!"
1,"I ordered these earrings and when arrived put them on havent taken them off. This size is great and not over powering at all. Love it when everyone is looking past your face towards your ears and saying love your earrings, those must have be expensive! I would highly recommend going ahead and getting yourself a pair, like said size is great."
0,"These earrings, though pretty, are very easily smudged. For something intended to be worn against the skin, this is a BIG NO, NO. When you first put the earrings on (after washing) they are sparkly and pretty. However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings. The oily smudges on them change the look from sparkly crystal, to cheap plastic. For a decoration (not worn on the body), the material is great, however as an earing, I wouldn't recommend them."
1,"I am a happy customer, had ordered the earings 3 days ago and i all ready have them !! I am very pleased. My sister originally had them and i liked how they looked so i decided to get a pair of my own, and the price is great. i love the way the earing shines has a almost a luminescent look :) very cute dangles :)would recomend for every woman :)"
1,"I Love swarovski everything!! These are beautiful earrings with lots of sparkle, and just the right size. They will go with everything, casual or elegant. I highly recommend Gem Avenue for any swarovski jewelry. I have purchased several items from them (all swarovski) and each piece is a great addition for me, nicely made, and beautiful. Thanks bunches!!"
1,"I was actually looking for a differently cut pair of earrings to match a necklace when I saw these. The square shape caught my eye because they reminded me of a squared cube dimestore ring I had as a child in the 60s. They looked so pretty and unique in the photo, and having found what I was searching for, I decided to treat myself to these earrings. They are simply gorgeous! Also, they are just the right size, not too heavy, and the lever back is most comfortable to wear. I must add that you can buy with confidence from Gem Avenue, for my earrings arrived quickly, securely packaged and in perfect condition, and they are decently priced."
1,"They are so lovely and received so many admiring comments from strangers that I bought a pair for my sister. Very lovely, Indeed!"
1,"These earrings look so clear and sparkly. I'm not convinced that they are genuine swarovski crystals because one side of each crystal does have a very faint coat of gold paint (you have to look very hard to see this), however I also saw that on some of the jewelry at the actual swarovski store, so that may be how they should be in order to make them sparkle as beautifully as they do. I gave these away as a gift and all the recipients were very happy. For the price this is definitely an item worth getting."
1,I am very satisfied with these earringsfor they are lovely and I get many complimentswhenever I wear them. I think they are a greatvalue at the price offered. I would certainlyrecommend them to a friend.
1,A nice addition to the jewelry box. A first for a milky green to go with my other shades of green outfits.
1,These are great earrings. I love leverback style earrings. They are very easy to wear. You can wear them with casual clothes as well as when you get dressed up. They also go very nicely with your Pandora style bracelet as the glass beads are very similar to the beads on your bracelet.
1,"Originally I purchased a pair of these for myself. I liked them so much that I ordered two more pair. One pair is for my daughter-in-law (her favorite color is Green), from the other pair I will make both of us a pendant. You did not have a pendent or necklace to match. I like matching sets...perhaps you did have it and I missed them... I have enjoyed most of the jewelery purchased from you..some I have not had the occasion to wear."
1,"Cute little earrings at a low price, what more could you ask for? I really like the green color and the sterling silver gleams nicely. I would recommend these earrings and this seller."
1,I love these earrings. They are delicate and quite pretty. Very pleased with this purchase!
1,Love the delicate design in these pretty green earrings! I wear them with my jade pendantand they match perfectly. Would definitely order from this seller again. Great service!
1,The green in these is so pretty! Very eye catching! The lever back is my favorite! GORGEOUS!
0,"We bought this item for our daughter for Christmas last year. When it arrived, it turned out that the pendant was nearly microscopic in size. It was also on a very flimsy chain, which broke almost immediately. Disappointed, and not recommended for kids."
0,"This thing was a complete piece of junk that broke when I first opened it. The best part is there was trouble with the payment with my gift card and I never got my money back after I sent it back. Thanks for nothing. By the way, you owe me roughly $45, thanks."
1,"I was very happy with my purchase of this daisy pendant. It's just what I wanting for myself to wear in memory of my beloved yellow lab, Daisy. I receive many nice comments on it."
1,We really like this quality of this necklace and how great it looks in person. The chain is the perfect length also. Very pleased with this purchase.
0,"This is not meant to fit on a man, granted I'm a big guy but it won't even fit over my head. Go ahead and buy it if you're tiny"
1,"This belly ring was in perfect condition. It was identical to its description, and was worth every dollar i paid. I will most probably buy from this seller again, as this product was good."
0,"I liked how this one looked, but it irritated my piercing. Others do not."
1,I am thrilled with the quality and the look of this ring. Everyone compliments me on it. It is very eye catching. I can't stop admiring it.
1,This is a beautiful necklace with a sturdy chain my 4 year old wore it for a long time without it breaking. The turtle is well crafted.
1,We bought this for a teacher appreciation gift! She loved it! It is how it appears...very pleased with it.
1,"Mine looks just like the photos -- very nice! The included chain in your basic silver chain, thin & a bit delicate. Came in a pale purple box with purple ribbon decoration on top. Now I just need earrings to match..."
0,The item was totally horrible. The beads were rubber and looked horrid
1,"I had a slight problem with my first order and they took very good care of the problem.. I would for sure hands down keep buying from them.. The item was great my husband loved it, it made a great fathers day gift.."
1,This is the best Cameo I have found for sale in years. Very nice quility for a costome jewelery piece. Any lover of Cameo pieces this is a must have for Christmas! The blue color is just exqusite and the resign raises in just the right ways not flat like alot of other pieces that are out on the market now days. A true journey to the past with a hit of present. Nicely priced for a tight budget also!
0,"Ordered this item for my girlfriend. It arrived damaged- 1 pearl was missing. Also, it doesnt look good and i would not buy it even for $5 if i new it will look that cheap."
1,"Stunning little bracelet! It is on the larger size, but that doesn't bother me like it has some reviewers."
1,"I was looking for unique Belly button jewelry for my wife and sent her this based on the other review, the bar (according to her) is a little long so she swapped the head and ball with another, but LOVES it and has gotten repeated compliments!"
0,"Overall, the band is very pretty and a good value for the money. The side stones go well with my wife's .8ct stone with an I color.Our only complaint is the prongs, they are somewhat sharp on the edges and it hurts when you scrape it against skin, espeically when holding hands. I am going to take it to a friend and see if he can smooth it out somewhat."
1,The service and price were fantastic! They arrived on time and looked great with my suit. I highly recommend buying from this vendor.
1,"I LOVE these bracelets!! I bought the green friendship one for 4 of my friends, my mother and grandmother around ST. Patricks Day. They LOVED them. The color is so rich and I LOVE charm. The clasp is easy to use and I have no fear of it falling off. I actually bought one for myself after I saw how cute they were. I bought the TEACHER one for my kids teachers, The NURSE one for their school nurse, and the PERFECT, PRETTY, PRINCESS one for my daughter. These bracelets are one of my favorite gifts to give."
0,I bought two bracelets from this company. Was excited they were beautiful but broke first time it was put on!
1,":) i love this bracelet with the gift box, it is very pretty, shipped fast, also bought more for christmas gifts"
1,This was purchased in memory of my mother's looking over us from heavan. It arrived in time for me to wear it on mother's day which meant the world to me. Thank you for a great transaction! 5 stars!!
1,This bracelet is big but it is very pretty and religious. It comes in a very nice package with a note that explains the bracelet.
1,"My 12-year-old daughter had this bracelet on her Amazon Wish List, and I got it for her for Christmas. It's beautiful and very well-made. Even the packaging is just lovely. Highly recommended! Edited to add"
1,This was a very nice gift my friends love it. I will buy more for my other friends love them
1,"I use these cloths for polishing my 22-250 rifle brass, as I am too cheap to buy a tumbler lol. You can polish a lot of brass with one cloth! These work good for me to polish brass while sitting around watching TV."
1,"Wow! This is my first time ever cleaning silver jewelry and it worked perfectly. My Tiffany jewelry were beginning to look somewhat tarnished so I researched all the products that might work. This piece of cloth worked wonders. The cloth is simple to use and affordable. You could see the shine come back in the jewelry within a few rubs. And yes, your fingers will get a little dirty."
1,"Sometimes, when I look up a product online and the reviews are all raving about it, I figure that the reviews are mostly from people who work for the company or something like that. Honestly, this product had that ring to me - the reviews were all so positive, I thought for sure they were all fake. I bought it anyway because I'm very comfortable with Amazon customer service & return policy.I had some jewelry that needed polishing. Some is sterling silver dipped in rhodium, some is gold. I didn't want to buy many different cleaners and thought that this might have a chance to be a one stop shop.The day it came, I pulled it out and laughed - it looked like just a regular microfiber dust rag. Then I used it. In a matter of 10 seconds, the ring I used it on was shiny again. Wow. I was really excited by that. Then I tried it on a few other pieces - all were sparkling in a matter of seconds. I was seriously amazed.So. Whenever I get really excited about a product, I think about all the other ways that I might be able to use it. Then it hit me. Last week was my anniversary with my husband and we drank a glass of champagne out of the toasting flutes from our wedding to celebrate. My husband washed them afterward but didn't dry them... The stems are made from silver. When I woke up in the morning, I found our toasting flutes to be horrifying - I actually cried. I thought they were ruined forever because the silver was all yellowed and horrible.This morning, I got the idea to try this rag out on the stems. I kid you not, in about 2 minutes of scrubbing with the rag (they were horrible), my toasting flutes looked almost brand new again. There are a few spots that probably wont be able to be fixed because it seems like the silver kind of got almost burnt off.. but seriously, the glasses are silver again and they're beautiful. The rag on the other hand.. it's totally black from this big project. But for only a few dollars, I'll happily buy another one to use on my jewely. For only a few dollars, this cloth saved my irreplacable toasting flutes.If you're looking for something to polish your jewelry, this is a great, perfect product - I'll be using it forever. If you're now thinking about all the other things you can use it to polish, I do suggest buying a few clothes at the same time because big projects ruin it kind of fast. However, it was worth every single penny. I couldn't be happier."
0,"These are nice polishing cloths. I did not like how they were sewn together and dont know why they were. But i only gave it 3 stars because they claim one cloth has chemicals already on it for cleaning or polishing .. and i did not see any difference when just using the cloths with no actual other cleaners.. There are white and blue colored cloths , one that suppose to have a cleaner on it and the other to polish, BUT they dont clean or polish alone.. They are however nice cloths as they are, they are big and if use a brass cleaner with (for example) they work very great!"
1,works perfectly! love it because its so easy to use. works on gold especially well. good buy for sure. AA
1,I bought this cloth to clean my silver jewelry. It works very well and is a good quality. I would recommend purchasing this product.
1,"This polishing cloth returned my tarnished antique Rajasthan belt to its silver glory. It took a lot of finger power to rub the tarnish away, but it was worth it."
1,"This is the very large silver cleaning/polishing cloth. It cleans very, very well. I am so pleased, and I will purchase another."
1,"Sent this as a gift. Understand from the recipient that it does all its supposed to do with all metals. Takes away a lot scrubbing, etc."
1,This polishing cloth is larger than most offered. Very reasonably priced. Purchased it for polishing gold although it can be used on a variety of metals.
1,"Great product for my jewelry business, works great. I need to clean the silver prior to shipment to my customers and all you have to do is polish the tarnish off with the white cloth and buff the shine out with the blue cloth. Being in one piece, sewn together is a space saver as well."
1,Easily removed the tarnish and smell from metal a lot of my jewelry. Counting on it to last for a long time.
1,This works very well on any type of metal. I gave some for Christmas gifts then had to have one for myself. I got it quickly.
1,"This is my second cloth, it lasts years. I dip my jewelry in professional cleaner, scrub with a tooth brush, then polish to a shine with this cloth. Especially brings silver to a beautiful shine."
1,Great on lockets and earrings with just wires to polish. I have a pair of black coral earrings and this is great to polish the silver wires without compromising the black coral.
0,"This cloth works ok, but you really have to put some elbow grease into it. Not as good as I was hoping for but better than nothing."
1,I really thought I was going to have to say goodbye to a few pieces of costume jewelry I own -- this cloth put the life back into them. Great product!!
1,i use this to finish up any polished surfaces after i clean up my guns!great product! gonna buy a few more once the one i have is work out!
1,"The perfect tool to keep things shining. It means no hot water, rubber gloves, or mess to polish a bit of jewelry or a knick-knack. And yes, I have a drawerful of them, to be trotted out & put on display when the relevant giver comes by for a visit. This makes the process just a bit less painful..."
1,"i recieved this ring yesterday, and it is even cuter than it is on screen! the color realy pops out at you. so far, this is my favorite ring in my collection"
0,Pricing reasonable for the product. The necklace and bracelet are fine. I lost both earrings first time I wore them. I think I needed to bend the wires a bit to make them less likely to come out. I've never had that problem before with this type of wire hook type earrrings.
1,"I bought this charm for my granddaughter's 18th birthday, we visit a different city for her birthday every year and last year it was San Antonio. She loved it!"
1,"This is my first pair of Threader earrings, they are very comfortable and they match with any outfit, dressy or casual.Since they are Aurora Borealis, they match with ANY color too.I really love them and have had lots of compliments on them."
1,"I believe this is actually saving my daughter's piercing. Her body rejects just about everything, and she even reacted negatively to titanium. Her original piercing migrated a lot, leaving the holes large and the flap of skin small. This is short enough to look good. If you are rejecting metals, I would definitely recommend bioplast."
1,This material is perfect for everyday use. It is wonderful. It even looks pretty too. I would recommend this product.
0,"So I ordered this ring a couple days ago, I have yet to see it, and was just wanting to know if anyone else has ordered it wondering about the quality. ^_^"
0,"Great packaging, and arrived very fast. As for the quality of the product it is very shiny and clean, but the only one thing that I didn't like was that the small grooves by the heart had some thing black in it, and that just marred the clean looked. But over all the design is pretty."
1,"I bought this because I needed a promise ring for my boyfriend and I, it's everything we wanted and more, it's beautiful, perfectly made, no flaws, the shipping and price was great in comparison to other sellers. Buy this!"
1,"This is a LOVELY ring. It was sent promptly, and in a beautiful box with a black velvet interior. Got here before it was even set to be shipped. Quick shippers, and high quality product. Very great buy."
0,"I got this ring, and it was gorgeous, fit me exactly, but within a week of wear, the band started to change, and the silver was so thin, it bent, and my ring broke... I'd find something a bit stronger if I were you."
1,"I just happened to look at my old review for this ring, and I feel like giving an update. The review date still says November 2007, it is currently February 2010, and I have been wearing it EVERY DAY since then. I have never ever had a problem with it. I find it really strange that another reviewer said the band got thin. Odd. My ring is so sturdy. I toss it on my nightstand, wash my hands with it, etc. I love this ring so much that I would even wear it as a cheap, casual alternative to a wedding ring. Seriously. (I'm not a girl who needs expensive diamond rings.)I'm keeping this useful tidbit from my original review:As a nice little bonus, it came in a cute heart-shaped box -- perfect for if you're a guy, and you want to give this to a girl. So, kudos on the presentation. And it was shipped pretty quickly. I got it about a week and a half after I ordered it."
1,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loved it. The design is the standard design, but when seen in person, the ring is much smaller than it actually appears to be in the photos, and so it looks even better crafted."
1,This ring is awesome. I have been looking for it for a long time! I am a big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and this is the same ring Angel gave to Buffy!
1,"I bought two of these rings to serve as my wedding bands. I am Irish and found it wonderful that it wasn't so ""girlie"" that my husband approved to wear it. This item is an excellent size to wear with an engagement ring and I was happy with the quality of it. Highly recommend!"
1,"I recieved my ring in perfect time, it was just as pictured, and the size was perfect, too!Now that I've covered all the basics...This ring is absolutely beautiful! I haven't taken it off since I got it and it still looks lovely!"
1,"Beautiful ring, I wear it all the time and it just stays shiny and looks wonderful. Thank you again very much"
1,This is a beautifully crafted and well made ring. It was just what I expected it to be and more.
1,I bought this ring for myself. The price was right and I loved the design....both an Irish and Scottish silver ring. I have small hands and this was perfect! I wear it almost everyday. I have had many compliments on it and enjoy wearing it with anything from jeans to church clothes!
1,"I have been buying this ring a few times this year. I bought all of my best friends the same ring for their birthdays,to symbolize our friendship, and they loved it. Although I just purchased the last bunch, including mine, I ordered two of these rings back in March for two of my friends, and the rings re still in perfect condition, even though my friends wear it all the time. The ring is smaller than expected, but like others have mentioned,it makes the ring look even more delicate and elegant. It really is a great ring, and I'm glad that the design is so well crafted that all of my friends that have received it, love it."
1,"I bought this ring on behalf of my brother who was giving it to his girlfriend. It looked lovely on the site of course, but when I saw it first hand, I was amazed at the artistry. I've seen a LOT of Claddagh rings in my time, and this is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful rings I have ever seen. It came in a beautiful gift box, and in my opinion, you can't beat the price. My brother gave it to his girlfriend, and according to him, she loved it as well. I'm thinking about buying one for myself!"
1,I bought this in the smallest size available for my 6 year old for her birthday and it was perfect. It is very heavy weight and has beautiful detail. It is exactly as pictured! Would buy again if I needed a gift for any child or lady as far as that goes! Arrived very promptly in a ok little box. I give it a A+.
1,"This ring is very nice, It has a different design but very nice. It came in a pretty little heart shaped box, with a bow on top. Perfect for gift giving."
1,"The ring looks great and I plan on wearing it often. If you like big rings it probably isn't for you. I was amazed how fast it arrived, one day before the estimated day of arrival."
1,I was excited about getting this ring and absolutely love it. i get compliments on it all the time and i am not having any issues with my finger turning colors or any rashes because of the metal used. i would recommend this ring to anyone that has to watch what metals.
1,"I think three years ago, i bought a ring like this from kohl. I ended up tripping one day and the ring broke in half and i was devastated. When i saw this ring on amazon which was almost the exact same, i had to have it :). It has lasted me perfected since January, and hasn't even got a scratch on it, the shine dropped a little but i still love it! great product."
1,This ring is perfect! 100% sterling silver. Perfect fit! Perfect look! Love it!
1,It is a beautiful ring and it fits great. I was a bit concerned when I opened the box. Somehow the anti tarnish sheet was left out of the box so it needed to be cleaned but it didn't take much before it was shining like it should be!
1,"I ordered this ring to replace a Claddagh ring that I had lost. I really love it and wear it every day. In fact, I will probably buy one for my sister as well."
1,"i ordered this ring for myself, and have been wearing it every day. it's very well crafted and just as pictured. i'm very happy with it."
1,Hello I got this as a replacement for my other claddagh ring that I lost in the ocean. and it's much better and shinier. I am very happy with my purchase...I will cherish this one and hopefully never lose it! :)
1,The service was excellent. I received my ring within a few days. Have had many compliments on it.
1,I bought the ring for a birthday gift. It was a hit at the party. It fit very nicely and looks really great!
0,"Pretty ring, but turned finger green after 1 day...I would not think sterling silver should turn your finger green..!"
1,"I love this ring. Is very detailed. Looks exactly as pictured. I was a little worried about sterling silber, but I haven't had a problem and I never take it off! Was exactly what i wanted!"
0,There is no way this ring is sterling silver. After wearing it for 8 hours it turned my finger green. I don't have any problems with any of my other .925 sterling silver jewelry. I'm so disappointed. The ring is beautiful. I feel saying it's .925 sterling silver is misleading.
1,i am satisfied..... i have not more to say and if i have to say more i will just skip the eval all together..
0,"You have to admit that this is a pretty ugly ring. The color looks off next to my olive skin. I wouldn't have bought it except that it was supposed to glow in the dark. This, it does not do. I have exposed it to plenty of light and tested it in total darkness, and I still couldn't see a thing. What a disappointment! Would have been better if at least it had been a better color, like pink."
1,"I got this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. Her dad has passed away last year and he played the Celo, so a music note is very important and meaningful for her. It is beautiful in person. I love all of the pins made by Artazia. They are truely unique."
0,Chain is very delicaate and fine. So fine you can't see the chain on my arm. But worth the money. Will pass it on to my granddaughter/
1,"I've always wanted to show the world how much I love Pink Luggage Baby Family, and how much it means to me. Now I can. Long live Luggage Baby Family Charm Pugster Italy."
1,"I got this as a gift for my Aunt on the holidays. Her name is roseso it was very applicable. She brought it with her when she cameand visited me. It is quite beautiful. She only wished that I boughther earings to go with it. She found them on her own. Oh, the ""Peril ofPearl"""
1,The pendant was shipped promptly. I recieved it in excellent condition. It was just as the seller described and I am very happy with it.
1,"I use these items to give to my nieces, and they love it:) Great gift for teenage girls!"
1,They are perfect. Just what I was looking for. I love them so much I ordered two more pairs :)
1,"I am very pleased with this ring, it is beautifully detailed and is a great option if you are looking for a good quality, classical diamond ring that colored elements without going overboard. It has a solid feel and a great sparkle. Good service of the seller as well, quick in responding and helpful. Great."
1,"This ring was beautifully made with great attention to detail. The design was masculine, yet included all of the symbols of the Claddagh. Most bands I found did not include the crown. It came in a nice leather ring box too!"
1,"We have a mini dachshund and when I saw these earrings, I know I had to have them. So like how our sweet puppy looks and co-workers really like them! Thank you!"
1,It was nice to find a bracelet that was adjustable to my wrist. It is very delicate which was what I loved about it.
1,Bracelet is attractive and of good quality. Appears to be well made. It made my daughter very happy to receive it.
1,"Very nice quality and beautiful range of coloring in these beads. For me, they are a perfect petite size. The price for a 3-piece set like this is quite great!"
0,"When this ring tarnished and I attempted to clean it in the proper recommend way, it turned black which means it is not sterling silver. I do not recommend anyone buying it. Now I'm stuck with an cheap ugly black piece of metal."
0,"I am disappointed in the way this ring looks when it is actually on a finger...It is VERY wide and the particular ring I got (I believe they are all different) looks crude and amateurish, with gaping ""holes"" in the wirework. That said, when twisted the right way the ring is surprisingly comfortable and I think the ring could look very striking on someone with very long, very slender fingers. I am planning on wiring stone beads into the gaps of the ring and giving it to my daughter, whose fingers are more suited to the style...we shall see what she thinks of it!"
0,"I had wanted this ring for a while because of its interesting look, and I finally got one recently. Well, I'm sending it back and exchanging for something else. While this ring is beautiful and large and fun, I didn't realize how much it would bother me wearing it. I was hoping for something I could wear every day, and this is definitely not an every day piece. It snags, it hinders my finger's mobility when I put it on due to its largeness, it kind of irritates me because some parts of it poke my skin, and it's soft metal. It reminds me of strings of solder or just really thin silver wire. I love Silver Insanity's products, but I don't like this ring enough to keep it.But thanks to Silver Insanity for letting me exchange and making it such an easy process."
1,Everyone has asked me about this ring.I even had a lady that wanted to buy it right off of my finger!!! It's sturdy and fits perfectly.
1,"i love thing ring because it is so modern, and very cool. the wire is placed in such a cool manner, and i love wearing the ring! it does get stuck on some of my shirts, but otherwise, its a great ring."
0,"The ring is very pretty, but the odd shape of it doesnt allow the ring to keep its shape. The ring was also about half a size too small for the size it was supposed to be."
0,"the product is nice, however the sizes are smaller than a ring of that size should be. Also the filigree tends to snag on clothing and other surfaces."
0,"The first day I got it, I thought it was alright even though it looked way better in the picture than it does i real life. I've had it now for three days and I realize how horrible it is. I don't want to wear it at all anymore, and I want a complete refund or exchange. It looks really cheap, and like something my little brother could have made for me in metal-shop class."
1,I love this ring. Its unique and awesome. The only thing I had to adjust to was that you can see the smelted wires but it adds to the artistic nature of the ring
0,"I really would love to give it 5 stars. The only reason I am not is because I too have clumps and some of the design isn't as pretty as the picture. One of the clumps is a little pointy and it irritates my finger. I've just had to learn to ignore it and if I twist it just right it isn't that bad. I do this because I do love the ring. It sounds crazy to do all that, but I love it that much! I get compliments on it too. SO...I really want to give it 5 stars but can't because I feel I didn't get the ""best one"" in the bunch."
1,"Got this today, and can't stop looking at it. It's beautiful. All who have seen it want one. I cant wait to try more of their jewelry."
0,"Unique Filigree Wirework Wide Band Sterling Silver RingI ordered two of these, the first order was perfect, so perfect my granddaughter got it. The second was less, had some areas that would snag. Sizing was not a problem.Thank you"
0,"I received lots of compliments on this unique ring. But, the trouble that I've had getting just the right fit after resizing and keeping the ring from tarnishing makes it hard for me to recommend."
0,"the earrings are very unsubstantial, and do not glisten as shown on picture, anyone want to buy my pair?would send cheap."
1,"the ring is beutiful more than i was expected in the picture, arrival fast. the price is good too. so i would recommend anyone with Gem Avenue"
1,This ring is much prettier than the picture shows and I am very pleased with it.
1,this ring is very pretty. The gem in the picture acutally looks more darker than in person. It's a lighter color of blue but it is exaclty like the picture. It's kind of got a big band but it's not too big on my finger. Already gotten a compliment on the ring! It's really pretty.
1,"This piece is no light weight, and is adjustable for most wrists.I've worn it a few times, and there is no tarnish, or signs of flaking, etc.Really, its a godo buy, and a perfect addition to (OUR) collection, as my wife seems to like it as well as I do, (and of course she wears it better than I do), but then We've been married for two decades, what else am I gonna say??This is one of many pieces purchased from this vendor, and will not be the last."
0,"recieved with missing parts, it was a mess, I returned it for my money back."
0,"I ordered and received the Salton cleaner and the steamer portion didn't work. Amazon was wonderful and sent a replacement immediately. The second one still doesn't work. There isn't a troubleshooting guide in the manual and when I called Salton, they could not provide any additional help."
1,"I have one of these I got somewhere else, and loved it, it really does clean jewelry well, and the chamber is big enough for any jewelry. Tried to get one as a gift and seller was advertising something they didn't actually have, so that part really sucked. That, and it took them a week to email me and tell me they didn't actually ship it because they didn't have one, even though the Amazon email said they did."
1,they are the perfect gift for the guy who turns a wrench!! I thought that they were AWESOME!!!
1,"I got these for my husband, who is a mechanic. They were nice and small, which was what we were looking for. He really liked them and he has gotten compliments them (well 'it' anyways, he only wears one)"
1,The necklace was perfect and a great price. Fast shipping and great communication. I would recommend this seller.Gretchen
0,"I received these earrings as a gift, and I was really excited because I love stars, and these small earrings are adorable. I don't have long hair so I never had a problem with the earrings popping off as other reviewers experienced, but I did find that they sat kind of oddly on my earlobes. It could just be the placement of my piercings, but I would just turn them upside down and found that they looked better that way. Sadly, after just a few wears, the stud broke off of my earring as well.I gave them one star because that's all I have left. :("
1,"I purchased these because I was looking for something different to the normal silver stud. I was afraid they were going to be to small, but they are just the right size. I haven't had any problems with my long hair and the earrings coming loose, as the previous reviewer experienced. I just know that I will be ordering from Sabrina Silver again in the near future. Thanks!"
0,"Very inexpensive. They were cute when they arrived, however after wearing them once, the post broke. I had to email for a return request and then wait for a reply. I was told I could send them back and receive a new pair this one time only. So we're talking almost four weeks for a $10 pair of earrings?"
1,"after reading the reviews i was afraid to put them on, but im wearing them now, and theyre holding up, long hair tangled in them and all. theyre cute and im very happy with them."
1,These earrings look just like the picture. They are very light weight and I can't wait to wear them to the next Tampa Bay Lightning game. Go Lightning!!
1,"I bought these earrings after I saw my friend wearing them for his music video. And for the price, they were absolutely right! I love these earrings. :)"
1,i love all my cross earing i look good in them they make me feel good and more when i were them
1,I returned these earrings only because I changed my mind. They were very lovely and just as pictured. The vendor was very gracious about the exchange and my credit was processed quickly.
1,i received this as an engagement gift and loved it. it's fabulous quality and lovely. it's now become the perfect gift for my newly engaged friends.
0,I found out the hard way that Swarovski Jewelry and &#34; SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS&#34; are 2 totally different things. Of course it would cost me half as much as they cost to ship them back so I guess I am stuck.
0,"I bought these for my birthday last year and I wasn't too thrilled to wear them. The crystals are larger than I had imagined. They are also coated with a layer of something that enhanced the coloring. I gave them to my sister-in-law instead. They were EXTREMELY sparkling under the sun light. I thought it attracted too much attention, but you might like them..."
0,"This ring was well packaged & mailed very fast. I love the cutout flowers & the whole ring is a beautiful presentation. The one complaint is that the gold ring is very thin, I just hope it lasts. Very professional company. Again for $490.00 I expected a slightly thicker ring.Hawaiian Floral Ring in 14K Yellow Gold"
1,"My 4 sons and I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. This necklace showing a mother and four children was perfect. It is now 6 months later and the necklace has not left my wife's neck. I expected to see the necklace tarnished by this point, but it still looks as shiny as the day she opened it. Great quality for such a low price. I would have paid 3x to 4x the price for this. Great buy!"
1,I just bought this for my mother as a Mother's day gift. She loved it! I am on a limited budget as a college student so- the price for such a beautiful piece was amazing!
1,The Wizards Armor ring is an eye catcher. It looks better in reality than on the web image. I love it and I recommend it as an original piece of jewelry.
0,"These earrings were so flimsy it was hard to insert into itsy-bitsy opening on the other side while it's in the ear! OMG! By the time I got it inserted the earring looked like a crazy ""S"" !!!!!!!!!!! They need to thicken these also. It doesn't take much to bend and break. Waste of money."
1,"Very nice, thinner style hoops. The silver is good and shiny. I like the thinner style which is why I ordered these. Looks more classy I think."
1,"This item was out of stock - GemAve called me immediately to let me know and recommended a great substitution, same style, with clear crystal stones - for the price, you can't beat it! i liked GemAve's customer service so well, and was pleased with the products i received, that it makes me want to buy more! in fact, i think i'll do that right now....."
1,A good addition to my Mom's grandkid charms. This one has held up nicely.
0,It is Fine for a child or young teen. I would not recommend it for an adult.
1,This is a very solid item with great weight .o problem wearing it daily. Looks as good as the day it came almost a year ago.
1,"These are gorgeous! They are heavy weight and have the look and feel of a much more expensive set. I am not an expert but have worn and owned cheap imitations and these are the real deal and look it. I highly recommend this as a lovely set if you like pearls or even if you are an expert with pearls, you will enjoy them. They have minor blemishes and that makes them unique and real and those are not that noticeable. A great bargain.!"
1,Amazing gift and comes in cute pouch.It is really heavy and Looks like an expensive gift.
1,"This was a present for my wife and she absolutely loved it. I like the potato shaped pearls, too - pretty cool."
1,"I never saw them to be able to respond to specific criticisms, but my sister loved them and that's the most important thing for me. She thought they were a lot more expensive than they were, so I guess that means it's a great value, too."
1,"I know the difference between akoya (round, perfect) and freshwater (potato-shaped, irregular) pearls. I purchased this SET (necklace and earrings!) hoping to get a decent set of pearls"
1,"I've a passion for pearls, have learned much about them and own a few strands--including a wonderful 30"" strand of Akoyas. Those are my ""dress"" pearls; not what I'd consider every day jewelry. I saw these, put them on my wish list, and sent a hint to the DH. Received them for Valentine's Day. The irregular (yet well-matched) shapes are casual enough for every day, luster is good, size of the pearls impressive. A local pearl shop sells something similar for about $100. So if you're looking for a wearable set that's not too dressy at a GREAT price, buy these! Nice packaging, too! Very giftable!!"
1,"Not really the seller's fault so I gave 5 stars, but these pearls are huge! Wearing them makes me feel like Wilma in the Flinestones! The earrings are so big that they overwhelmed my earlobes and kind of drooped. Beautiful though and the presentation was nice with the bag and box. I would recommend only if you like huge jewelry."
0,They were really pretty but to big for me. I returned them
1,"Very nice size, almost perfect shape, beautiful luster and color. Great to wear with almost anything. They are very chic and classy. I'm very happy I bought them!!!"
1,"I was a little worried when I purchased these that the pearls might be different sizes, or because the price was so low that the quality would not be there. My wife absolutely loved them. She was speechless, and when I first saw them, I loved them too. They go great with my wife's wedding dress. She may not even wear the earrings, but just the necklace is worth is for the price.I would easy recommend these to EVERYONE who is in the market for pearls. They are great (and the price was even better)."
1,These pearls are really great! They are the perfect gift for any occasion. They look even better out of the box than they do on these pictures. A Great Buy!
1,I gifted this set to my aunt in US and she absolutely loves it ! Looks like a great deal for the price you pay. Thanks Amazon !
1,"I got these for my daughter for Valentine's Day, thinking when she's loses them I will have only lost $29...They are beautiful, striking and made her day. They are a great value, a highly recommended purchase."
1,"I loved this necklace! I recently lost it and was very upset about it. It was beautiful, never tarnished like sterling silver usually does, and was always complimented on it!"
0,This silver ankh was a gift and the pendant was great but the necklace was too short for a large man's neck.
1,"This necklace will quickly become one of my favorite jewelry pieces. It is well-made and the stone work is beautiful. Nice weight, but not too heavy. The included chain is a good length, as the cameo may be worn with other longer pieces."
1,"Adorable owl pendant! Very good quality, better than expected! Substantial piece, chain is nice also, especially for the reasonable price! Pendant is the perfect size, not too big, not too small. Packaged well, super fast delivery! Cute little owl~~ I love wearing him!!"
1,I ordered these for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. She wanted a dangling pair of earrings. These are perfect for her. They are just the right size and they are not too mature. They are beautifully made and the price for them was just right.She will love these and I'm sure she will want to wear them all the time. I will definitely buy from this vendor again.
1,Got these as a birthday gift for my 10 year old niece. She is in love with pink and butterflies so it was a perfect gift. She loves them!
1,This was a birthday present for our granddaughter who confided in me that her little brother lost all of her earrings! I ordered these the day before her birthday on a Sunday and received them that Tuesday following a holiday. She said they are her absolute favorite and she wears them all the time. They don't hurt her ears and she just Loves them!
1,"Bought these for my daughter and she loves them. She wears them everyday. They look great and have held up to several weeks of constant wear. What I like is the the dangle is not so long that it gets in the way, but allows her to feel grown up."
1,I bought these for my 10-year old niece and she loved them. They're very cute and not too grown up like some earrings for children. Excellent quality.
1,I wasn't certain if my daughter would like these. When they arrived they looked much better than the picture. I know she'll love them. They are a brighter pink color than the picture.
1,"I gave these to my granddaughter for her 7th birthday. They're a little longer dangles than I wanted for her but they look so sweet & sparkle. She loves pink, butterflies and anything that sparkles and shines so they were a big hit. I think I might buy her the lavender ones as well. I know she will love them! Great price and look more expensive, good overall value."
1,"I wanted to find a unique ring for proposing to my boyfriend. He said yes, even though he believes only a man should propose. The shipping was faster than its estimated date. The fit was also perfect, I ordered a size 10. He really enjoys the fact that it does not look like a traditional wedding band. He has a love for tree houses and has built a few and the screw head accents made me think of him when I purchased the ring. :-)"
1,"i love this gemstone, but it is not terribly strong or tough. i use as a thmb ring to remind me to be loving. i have bought two of them and both are very pink without black inclusions which are inherent in this stone."
1,"This Rhodonite ring is gorgeous. It is the kind of pink color that I like and has specs of green in it, I mean I think it's green. As I already have a ring band like this in Aventurine I already know that these rings are a bit fragile. That's why I odered 2 and will wear it carefully. For this price I might order more in a different size. The ring bands arrived in two very cute gift boxes. Thanks Amazon for your excellent service."
0,"it did, in fact, crumble in my hand an hour after I put it on. I remember wondering during just which part of my morning commute had I been nailing deck screws in with my hands or something to have achieved this incredibly unfortunate result. Upon inspection when I picked up the pieces from the floor of my car where I'd dropped them in disgust, I realized how intensely porous and fragile the stone was... maybe this ring should come with a disclaimer"
1,"As usual this merchant has excelled with their products,delivery and quality of service.Because of this I shall continue to shop with them whenever I am in need of good quality merchandise at the right price.Bill Breen"
0,"This has finally arrived! It took 8 days.Upon inspection, it is much prettier in the picture than in person.the sizing is nice, and it stands up pretty tall. The amethyst stone is a beautiful rich purple, very natural looking, and the polished silver is very bright.My only complaints, and why I had to give it 2 stars:1. the well of the ""V"" that holds the amethyst isn't polished, it looks barely sanded. IT detracts from the face of the ring.2. the CZ are not even as close to sparkly as they are in the picture, even under florescent lighting.3. the band is so thin, that with everyday wearing, the band will break soon.For $24, it's ok. But if I had seen it in a store, I wouldn't have purchased this. (hence the 2 stars instead of 3.)"
1,"This order arrived more than promptly, and I was very pleased to order and get it so quickly. Great job and many thanks!"
0,"I was looking for a simple, short pearl necklace to wear to a wedding and thought I'd found the perfect one. But I was mistaken. The minute I put the necklace on, the catch broke! And I couldn't fix it. I was shocked. I've ordered multiple items, including jewelry, from Amazon, and never had that experience. I am going to attempt to return it."
0,"I ordered these to wear at my niece's wedding. I was so happy to see the box waiting at my door. Unfortunately, when I opened the jewelry box to look at my new pearls, what I saw was not the purple strand I had ordered and expected, but a sandy/peach strand. It's a beautiful necklace, and I'll probably give them to my mother for Christmas, but I was wanting purple to go with my chosen outfit."
1,This is a great product.It can help save lives that's why it is so important.
0,"Beautiful exterior - my daughter was so thrilled to get this for Christmas - but it won't stay closed due to a flimsy closing device. It isn't usable since the locket stays flipped open all of the time now. It was so disappointing - do not waste your money. Take the time to go to a jewelry store where you can actually handle a locket, test its lock, etc. I won't make this mistake again!"
0,Don't waste your money! I bought this locket to give to my mother for christmas. It does not stay closed. Just by picking up the locket to put it on it comes undone. I didnt realize this major flaw existed until after I had gone to the trouble of having pictures sized down. That in addition to the fact that it was already so close to christmas I decided to keep the locket and take it to a jeweler to see what could be done. For a fee the jeweler agreed to add a extra closure to the locket. He said he has had ten or so locketscome in recently with the same problem. Buyer beware. I will have to wait a week or so for the locket o be ready and after the extra cost I should have gone with another locket.
1,Necklace was exactly as I expected. Good quality. great price. Item arrived sooner than expected. I would definitely order from this company again.
1,This was a gift; I never saw it as I had it direct shipped to Mom but she was very pleased.
1,"I ordered this chain to wear with a new pendant. Nice sparkle, nice chain."
1,Company earrings were purchased from was prompt and the craftsmanship was top notch. Quality of the stones was excellent. It is a pleasure doing business with Szul and Amazon.com
1,"I originally ordered the gold plated version of this bracelet, but I liked it so much that I decided I would return it and order the 10K version. When my 10K bracelet arrived, it was defective. I notified Precious Accents, and they then notified Rembrandt Charms, the manufacturer. Judy at Precious Accents communicated my issues with the defective bracelet to Rembrandt and they had one of their jewelers inspect the replacement 10K bracelet prior to shipping it directly to me from their factory. All I can say is I experienced wonderful customer service and I now have a beautiful and very unique 10K charm bracelet that I will enjoy for many years to come!"
1,"These 4mm studs are the perfect size for the ear, not too much or too little. They have substantial silver prongs holding in the stones with are convincingly opal-like. Nice blue color and a great price. Thanks, Silverspeck!"
1,Can't stand yellow gold. Not too sure about quality and other jewellery stuff but I know this looks really great on my finger. I use it as a day to day ring but might pass as something for a dinner or other semi-special occassion. Are days when I don't wanna take it off at all. Reaaly cute and worth the amount I paid.
1,This is a beautiful bold ring - the stone is beautiful. If you are looking for a bold smokey quartz ring you will not be disappointed with this ring. It looks much more expensive that it actually was.
1,"Got this as a back-up, it seems more sturdy than the other one I bought (hence, tennis bracelet) The stones aren't quite as nice, and the diamonds are kinda just there. But again, remember the price and realize that you aren't going bankrupt on this purchase.I don't plan on returning it, but maybe keeping it for another day...But the item is still nice for the price and the seller really hustled it out to me. A smart thing for a boy to have deep in his drawer...you never know when a sparkly will have its most effect.**Update** had to return item since under careful lighting, there were cracks in the stones, (no, not inclusions, but as if they had struck something hard and cracked) it is still in the return process, if the replacement is fine then we are all cool, if not, then debit back my card. Will stay posted on this event as it unfolds, but nothing wrong other than product (which is fine for now) we'll see how the process continues***Update*** item was returned and refunded. No complaints against the seller, it all worked out in the end."
0,"I bought this as a gift for my mom. It is admittedly not to my taste, but my mom has very different taste in jewelry than I do. I was actually kind of excited about it, because it seemed like something she would like a lot.Pros"
1,This charm is a fine rendering of a lovely Old English Sheepdog head. I am very pleased with the quality of this charm.
1,"NCAA again lives up and surpasses themselves with these Florida Gator cufflinks (University of) like you all don't know what Florida Gators are. Best dressy gator purchase for my husband. He loved, loved, them. Great for us females who wear french cuff shirts as well!! Look great with jeans or a tux!"
1,"I just received this ring and was impressed. It's very pretty on, very dainty. I bought it to wear next to my solitaire engagement ring and it looks beautiful with it. The diamonds are small of course, but the ring itself is thin, so the diamonds stand out and it has great sparkle. When your hand is in a natural position, it looks like the diamonds go all the way around the ring. I shopped around and this is an amazing price for this ring, some cheap mall jewelers were charging $200+ for lower quality!! I would highly recommend it!"
0,"I ordered this product at the end of February, but still have not received it. Don't be fooled by Amazon's statement that it will be ""in stock soon."" It does look like a nice ring, and there is a favorable review on the same ring with bigger carat weight, but it is hard to say when you will really ever get it. If you need this item in the near future, I suggest looking at another ring, or with another merchant. If you have all the time in the world, then Amazon will be able to get it to you SOMEDAY."
1,"Yes, it is very beautiful. A gift for my sister. She loves it."
0,Well done in design this pendant is approximately the size of a penny in diameter. Although small the diamond cut pattern is very nicely done. I would think this pendant more of the size for a charm bracelet rather than for a pendant on a chain.Of the two peace pendants the other offer is more impressive due to its size and it isn't flat but convex in design which lends more visual interest.
1,I purchased this charm for my daughter for Christmas. She LOVES horses! We couldn't be happier with the quality and beauty of the charm. It could be worn with a silver chain or a gold one and it looks great!
1,This charm is really cute and is actually 3D! The shiny finish makes it quite special as well. It looks great on a neck chain or bracelet.
1,great value for the price. Very well made with attention to detail. Lots of sparkle and great for a glamerous occasion. SilberSpeck was fast to ship and item came in a pretty gift pouch.
1,"The earrings were delivered as promised and were absolutely stunning, appraised at more than double the price I paid for them. They are so beautiful, I wear them every day."
1,"The ring arrived in great condition, and very fast as well. Item must have shipped same or next day as order was submitted."
1,BEAUTIFUL DESIGN ON THIS STERLING SILVER RING. GOES WELL WITH THE CELTIC HEART EARRINGS AS A SET. GORGEOUS WORKMANSHIP.
1,This is beautiful! I love the detail and it's on both sides so you don't have to worry about which way it goes. Have had several compliments already.
1,I looked at the reviews about this necklace before ordering. I found the necklace to be beautiful and as pictured. Glad I ordered it. I think people who order it will be pleased and the price can't be beat.
1,I purchase these earrings to match the pendant. It is very nice to be able to find good looking clip on earrings. The set looks great together. They came from a gift certificate from my daughter so they are very special to me.
1,I purchased these earrings as a gift to go with the matching rose pearl necklace and they were perfect. Would highly recommend!
1,"These stud earrings go with everything, I rarely take them off. Wonderful product, shipping was fast, and they were packed in a lovely box."
1,I am not allowed to wear dangle-earrings at my job. These were perfect for style AND I was still allowed to wear them with my uniform. Excellent!
1,very delicate and i wear them with a lot of different things. may order a pair for my sisiter so she wont steal them!!!!
1,"This was exactly what I was looking for. My mom had bought one for my sister and I 8 years ago. Upon her sudden death a few months ago, I wanted my younger sister to have the same exact one we shared. I found it here for a great price. It brought tears to our eyes. Thank you so much for making this a convienant purchase."
1,I love this. I travel a fair amount and when I am gone my daughter and I each wear our piece of this. It is a great weight and good quality. A little bit bigger than a dime-fairly small but a good size.
1,"I don't wears rings often, but when I do, I tend to get attached to only one ring. I lost my one ring that I liked to wear a couple months ago and have been on the search for a new one. It took me FOREVER because I'm so picky. I wanted a unique looking ring that wasn't too outstanding, bold, looked cheap, or flashy. But I did want a ring that looked sophisticated, beautiful, and still catch someones attention subtly. This ring is awesome. I love it."
1,"The ring I ordered was exactly like the picture, fit perfectly, arrived in a timely matter, and I've had several compliments!"
1,"I puchased this for my husband after going to local stores looking for the ""perfect"" charm. I found it at Amazon.com.It's an added bonus to the chain I purchased for him for last Christmas.You have exceeded my expectations. . .Colleen"
1,"I was very pleased with both the case in which this item was delivered and how it looked on my wife's toe. The band is approximately 3/16"" wide, so it does not overpower the toe on which it is worn. The heart design is impressed into the gold of the band, deep enough to be visible, but not so deep as to collect dirt. My wife has very slender toes and had to squeeze the ring all the way closed, but it fits very nicely and she has worn it since she received it this summer. The ring has worn well and has caused no discomfort to the toe on which it is worn or the toes next to it."
1,"This is an easy toe ring to wear. It's very comfortable and even if I forget to take it off, it doesn't bother me when I have on pumps or tennis shoes. It's also really cute. The hearts can actually be seen on it, when someone looks down to my feet."
1,"I love, love this ring. When I got it, it was everything that I expected and then some. The quality of the stone is amazing. The color of the citrine zirconia is just like the image, if not better. The ring is true to size. I love it so much I just ordered the same ring but in the blue topaz. The stone shines a lot,so if you like shine this ring is definetly for you. I highly recommend it. I received it quickly as well. I got it after four days. Hope all of you find this helpful."
1,These were purchased for my daughter to wear on her wedding day. They looked beautiful on her!
1,The picture of these earrings don't do them justice. We bought them for my daughters wedding and they are pretty and old fashioned looking. Just what she wanted!
1,These earrings along with their matching necklace are stunning. They look so real and can make any bride stand out :)
1,The ring came with a gift box which was really cute. It lookes good except it was a little big for my husband but we both like it.
1,"This is a surprisingly nice ring. I have always preferred silver to gold and this ring, for its price, for an even higher price for that matter, is a great choice. I have had several compliments on it. It is a masculine, finely made yet simple silver band. It's comfortable and strong. I am quite surprised it's only $10. I could have spent $30 on it and still been just as satisfied with it.5 stars. Went beyond my expectation."
0,"Beautiful rings, exactly what was shown in the picture, but the size was a little off."
1,When I ordered this ring I didn't expect the quality with such a reasonable price. The size was exactly as expected. I would definitely order from Gem Avenue again.
1,"I'v been weearing this ring for few months now as a replacement for my wedding band, and its still comfortable and looking great. It has accumulated minor scratches throughout, but that's the nature of silver and how rough I use my hands. The ring is awesome for such a low price."
1,"got this ring for my husband who lost his first ring. he loves it, he said its better than the first one and im excited cause its so cheap!"
1,I received my ring today and love it . Just what I needed. Simple and pretty. Everyday ring..dont want to wear my diamond band around the house and to do laundry :)
1,"I read elsewhere in the reviews that a lady's husband got in the shower and his ring turned. If you use selenium sulfide shampoo and it comes into contact with silver, it will turn the silver dark as if badly tarnished. I have had a difficult time trying to get the ring back to normal. So beware!~Kathleen"
1,I purchased this ring for my thumb. I am a large size girl and have pretty fat fingers. I love jewelry and have always wanted a thumb ring. Now I have one that fits perfectly and it looks good on my thumb! I love it!!!
1,Beautiful ring. Looks great as thumb ring for ladies. Excellent company to do business with. Many great buys and gorgeous jewelry.
1,I was very pleased with the ring but I gave the wrong size my mistake not yours. Otherwisw I am very happy with it. thanks chuck
1,I purchased two of these for my twin grand daughters March birthday. They are georgeous and a big hit at their party! The important thing is the girls LOVE them!! I won't hesitate shopping at Amazon in the future.
1,"Very pleasureable experience. Received the item promptly, real nice piece of jewelry, GREAT price.Thank you!"
1,I received the item and it is beautiful and I am very happy with it.
1,"I am a Naruto fan, and I brought this necklace for my birthday! It looks great on me, not to mention the meaning of the leaf symbol. It made my birthday special."
0,"The earrings that I have are darker than the ones in the picture though they are still a nice cobalt blue. Too bad they aren't a little bigger, I'd like them a lot more. Still cute though."
1,The earrings are even prettier than they appeared in the picture. They also look more expensive than what I actually paid. Another satisfying purchase from Amazon.
1,"I've been looking for a pair of inexpensive, beautiful vintage looking earrings for a Victorian Era Christmas party to go along with my black dress (yeah, it's probably focused on the Edwardian Era or even later, but fashion haven't changed drastically yet during those days. They could still get past the near-30-years difference.)To be fair, they do resemble the pictures, just that you don't actually get to touch the products. I probably won't get them if I were to be shopping in a mall, but they do the trick. Not sure how the blue and orange look, but black could definitely fool people thinking they're expensive / authentic without taking them off and examining them. Would still look good with modern dresses and outfits."
1,"I purchased these earrings for my mom as a gift to symbolize her first grandchild, a September sapphire baby. She loves them. They look just as they are pictured here and look very nice on. Definitely recommend these."
1,These Peridot earrings are beautiful and are exactly as described. The service was excellent and deliver of the item was extremely fast. Thank you Sabrina Silver.
1,This belly button ring is very cute and simple but also glow in the dark! Great for everyday.
0,"Product was good and a reasonable value, shipment was much slower then expected or told."
1,"I ordered the pendant to wear with a white gold chain, and it looks lovely. The rose gold background has a brushed finish, and the white gold moon and stars sparkle above it."
1,This is a nice green color. It's fairly modern-looking so I wouldn't recommend it if you generally wear informal stuff. It's a very nice piece for the price!
1,"I ordered my earrings on line and got them quickly. I was surprised how easy there were to put on and how comfortable they are. I noticed a difference right away. I have not had cravings. Actually, food is less appealing. Thanks for the product."
1,Thanks for the great product and service. My grand child loved them since she can't wear pierced earrings. Will order again in the future.
1,"This fairy is different from all the fairys I've seen out there. It has an Art Nuveau felling to it. Doesn't have a bail so you slide the necklace chain throughout its wings and it looks like she floats aroung your neck. It looks exactly like the picture, really pretty!"
1,Have had numerous compliments on this cross. It's so dainty and pretty. I am glad I purchased it.
1,Was exactly what I ordered & was beautiful. Recieved it very quickly -got it just in time for Christmas. I was/am very pleased.
0,"It's pretty, but it's not like in the picture. The two rings don't fit together, so there's a big gap. Not for me."
0,"I bought this ring and was skeptical, but I've been proven wrong, it's lasted really well, and I get compliments all the time. It's a great every day ring."
1,"Yes, this is a pretty piece of jewelry, and Eve's Addiction is a great company to do business with."
0,"Let me first say that the delivery was excellent. I got the item earlier than expected. I don't blame the seller at all. However, the problem is that I got what I paid for. The balls are plastic so the metal post easily stripped the grooves where it screws into the ball. There was no way to tighten it. I lost the ball and the ring the 2nd day I was wearing it. However, the one day I had the ring, I loved it. It was pretty that first day."
1,This belly ring is super girly. The pink is much more vibrant than it is in the picture and the top ball glows in the dark. All my belly rings from BodyCandy are of nice quality and very cute - especially the pink ones!
1,"I have been trying to make a bracelet of the different countries I have traveled to and this has helped me complete the set. Product came really, really fast (week ahead of scheduled delivery) and in excellent (new) condition. I would definitely use this seller again. Thank you :)"
1,I really like these earrings. They are made very well and they are larger than what I thought they would be. I'm very pleased with them! Great price too!
1,"I absolutely love this earring cuff, it is perfect for any size ear and it bends easily in order for it to be adjusted properly."
1,"This product was even better than I thought it would be. The picture doesn't do the product justice, it is much prettier in person. I always get compliments when I where it. Very comfortable to wear and put on!"
1,"I bought this bracelet for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loves it. This is a great gift bracelet for a man to give to his significant other, especially for those of us on a budget ! For $35, this bracelet can't be beat."
0,I bought these for my Mom and she loved this Ying/Yang stuff....but I thought these earrings would be a lot bigger. They were really tiny. She liked them but I was hoping they were bigger.
1,I thought these earrings were smaller than the picture online. But my daughter loved these yin/yang earrings. The quality & workmanship is very good. Happy with purchase.
1,"I own several pairs of sterling silver earrings purchased from the same vendor, and I am very happy with the quality."
0,"Purchased this and it arrived fast but;no glimmer at allone stone feel out in the box on arrivalfeels and looks very cheap and bubble gum machine likeworth about $2.50, nothing more then that..royal rip off and I question who would ever write it's grand, seriously ...run from this one"
1,"This ring is really beautiful, the stones shimmer and the three colors really look good with any outfit!"
1,"Pave Rolling Trio Eternity BandI have had the ring for about 5 months and none of the stones have fallen out or are loose that I can see. I love the ring and I wear it all the time. The only negative that I can see is that it isn't the most comfortable to wear because it is thick and it can get caught on clothing, but it was definitely worth the price."
1,"I am quite fond of this pin. It is not as busy as most holiday pins, which is nice because it goes with every outfit and can be worn on any sweater or coat and I'm wearing mine everyday with everything! I believe it is prettier in person than the photo.Also, it is quality silver and a nice weight to it without being so heavy that it leans down. No fears of having this one bent by a seat belt because it is well-made with a good amount of metal.It is also a nice size, not too big, not too small and the design is classic. In person, it just looks like a pretty brooch from afar, upon closer inspection you realize it is a poinsettia. All holiday pins should have such understated elegance."
0,"I do not blame the seller nor the maker of this ring, but just my luck im allergic to Titanium. Although allergies to titanium, if its not 100% pure there is a chance of reaction. And of course even if it is 100% pure it is possible for a reaction. Be aware of what metals are in or around your body to eliminate any possible allergic reaction."
0,"Not much to say here, not too crazy about it but it is made of leather."
1,My 4yr old daughter received this for her birthday. It's a great craft that works on her fine motor skills. I ordered 2 more for her to work on as christmans gifts for her grandmothers and another smaller kit for her aunts. I think it will be great for her to create gifts this year! She smiled from ear to ear as she looked at her creation-I think she'd rate it a 5+star item!
0,"When the item came they were soo tiny and thin, i thought they were too childs pinky rings. I couldn't believe how the image is soo misleading to you. I would prefer all jewelry be described by inches not mm."
1,"These earrings are perfect, they are a gift for my mom, but I might just steal them back from her. They are pretty small, but a fair size, very cute. Would even be perfect for a little girl. But they are beautiful and don't look cheap at all! It also shipped very quickly, and came in cute packaging I'll probably just pop a tiny bow on the box and stick it under the tree."
0,This made a great gift for my boss. She's an orthodontist that graduated from Uconn. The only downfall is it could have been just a little bit bigger for her silver charm bracelet.
1,"They are very well made, and they sparkle so much! I loved the color. I bought them as a gift, and I can't wait to give them."
1,very cute if youre just wanting something inexpensive i got this set to go along with a black pair and a CZ pair to wear all 3 sets to go with my &#34;baltimore ravens&#34; theme outfit!
1,"I love these! The color is great, but I'm prejudiced, as I'm a big fan of red.They are a nice size, and I wear them either in my 2nd ear peircing or the main peircing."
1,"These are so comfortable, I forget that I am wearing them. People compliment me when I wear these. My 17 year old daughter loves to borrow them."
1,Great product at a reasonable price. The Kendal ultrasonic jewelry cleaner works great. This machine cleans jewelry and makes it look brand new! (with the right jewelry solution of course) after a few runs with the ultrasonic (depending on how dirty your jewelry is) your jewelry will look shiny and sparkle like new. My fiance Loves it! this product also comes with a watch stand and cd adaptor just in case you want to throw those into the ultrasonic. great product at a great value.
1,"This is my 3rd ultrasonic jewelery cleaner. Best price yet by half, great size for everything I clean such as jewelry, eye glasses and such. The last one passed away after only 4 years so I hope this one last longer.My jeweler said to use water and just add a bit of Windex and it has worked perfectly for 10 years."
1,"Great on jewelry and especially glasses. Worked as it should, no complaints. I do recommend using distilled and/or deionized water."
1,"It's just what I needed. The timer goes up to 480 seconds (8-minutes). The tank capacity is 2.5-cups, whereas the other small machines I looked at are only 2-cups. The only thing I wish the manufactureres of these machines would make is a removeable tank for easy emptying and cleaning.I highly recommend the Kendal Ultrasonic machine."
0,"I bought this for my husband to match mine & to replace his older ring which was worn. The band that spins broke after only a couple days of him wearing it. Nice idea, but cheap & complete garbage."
1,I use this to clean my atomizers for my vapor pipe the ego-t. I use Vodka and it cleans them great. It works well with water too when clening all metals.
1,"This is a top choice ultrasonic cleaner. My previous cleaner broke, and I was looking for an inexpensive replacement. Not only is this new cleaner $10 less than the one I had purchased 7-years ago, it is larger and more powerful. And, it is large enough to hold CD's with the CD support accessory. The watch protector accessory provides an avenue for safely cleaning a non-waterproof watch. This cleaner is definately a top choice."
0,Worked well for about 20 loads at 5 mins each (over the course of a month) then overheated and blew the transformer inside the unit.
1,"Para muchos de aquellos que compramos aqui en AMAZON y son de habla hispana.. paso a detallar mi experiencia.El aparato funciona muy bien y limpia las cosas de uso diario MUY BIEN y mas si se hace con agua caliente o agregandole algun quimico (limpiador multiuso ej)Es ideal para joyas tipo anillos - pulceras - cadenitas y cosas delicadas como relojes.CAundo esta muy sucio es necesario ciclos largos pero por lo general con 180 min es mas que suficiente.Mi experiencia fue muy buena!!! deja las cosas muy nitidas ! En especial cuando es joyeria o cosas de metal.ATENCION!!! No se confien este aparato que es para LIMPIAR y no para restaurar, Asi que si esta rayado - oxidado o gastado .... No esperen un milagro. El articulo quedara limpio pero con los mismo detalles."
1,"I refill my own HP printer ink cartridges after they run out of ink. Sometimes the ink in the cartridges dries out and even after refilling, the ink will not flow through and print. So, I purchased the Ultrasonic Cleaner thinking that it might help clean them out. It worked perfectly! I've now salvaged all my old cartridges for refilling and saved hundreds of dollars over the cost of buying new ink cartridges.The Ultrasonic Cleaner instructions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use. It took just a few minutes to set up and use the product the first time after unpacking it."
0,"I bought this for personal use of the cleaning of my tattoo grips and tubes before autoclave sterilization, hoping to cut out some of the vigorous scrubbing inside the tips and between the grip texture grooves. I was very disappointed and would suggest to others looking to go cheap to just save up and get a nice Crest or Branson."
1,I bought this for my fiance as a Christmas gift for her engagement ring. It became an immediate hit with the ladies cleaning their jewelry and glasses. It's kinda fun to watch the gunk and film just seem to float off the stuff. It can also be used for CDs and DVDs. We were having problems with a rental DVD until we put it in the cleaner and it played without a hitch after that!
1,"This rosary bracelet is very sweet and delicate...but not TOO delicate for my almost 4-year-old daughter. She loves it, and we let her wear it when we pray the rosary."
1,"This pendent could not be more beautiful. It was even nicer than I expected. The only thing I don't like is that the thing the chain goes through keeps turning upside down so that the pointy part is facing up. It seems like it's not balanced right, or something. I love it anyway and wear it all the time."
1,This piece's high quality is belied by its low price tag! It has heft and solidity and at least my particular moonstone has the most gorgeous fractures and inclusions giving it a lovely depth and complexity. I've only owned it for three days and have gotten dozens of compliments.
1,"This pendant is absolutely beautiful!! It is even more beautiful than on the picture. The blue flash of the moonstone is amazing. As for Silver insanity... wonderfull experience. Delivered in two days on regular shipping, way before estimated delivery time."
0,"I loved this ankle bracelet! Unlike other ones, I barely would notice when it was there and it didn't rub against me and irritate my skin. After about 6 months though, it broke =("
1,"Great item, impecable and fast delivery.I'm very happy with my purchase.The item is a lot bigger than it seems to be from the picture but also a lot nicer than I expected.Size suits very well the model.Overall, this is another great item from Silver Insanity."
1,"Not much to say other than its a titanium ring, as expected.Looks good, feels good."
1,This bracelet is very nice! It's so light you almost can't feel it. The clasp and links seemed sturdy. The item photo shown on the listing page is very accurate; the bracelet was exactly what I anticipated. Good quality for low price... recommended.
1,All I can say is they looked great on my mom and she loves them. she wears them with casual wear and she looks very stylish!!!
1,"Had to replace wedding band, lost after 37 years on my finger. Just received this ring within 48 hours of placing order and am completely satisfied...very attractive."
1,"Does the job! Cloth is small, does not stain your hands, cleans andpolishes excellently! Get it for brightening up your rings!"
1,I purchased these for my 14 year old daughter. She loves them! I love them because they are not too large or too dangling on her. They are lovely.
1,"These are adorable. I bought these as a gift for my sister, but they are sooooooo cute and nice quality that I'm considering keeping them for myself. They come in a small black velveteen gift bag."
1,The bracelet looks absolutely cute in person and wonderful on the skin. Its not bulky at all and lays flat on the wrist. Its simple and strong. The clear crystals are just so pretty glimmering in the sunlight.
0,"When i purchased this along with the matching necklace, the company sent me an email saying that they had a tarnished bracelet and they wouldn't send it to me so i had the option to wait for a new one or to cancel the order. So i chose to wait and to be honest they sent it right away and gave me back the shipping money. But the bracelet is not as shiny as the necklace at all. It's as if it's made of stainless steel not silver plated. I don't know if this is the tarnished bracelet they were talking about in their email because i have nothing to compare it to except the necklace. It's not like the picture."
1,The bracelet is very nice and the stone is almost a Jade variation. Kind of a Bluish/Greenish. It is a beautiful cut and color.
1,"I have always loved wolves. This is a pendant that shows the beauty of the wolf. I want people to ask me why I love these animals, because I welcome the opportunity to explain why I do. I recommend this for all animal lovers."
0,"I loved the ring. It's beautiful, but after wearing it for only a few hours I got a nice green ring around my finger...making me feel like it's not really sterling silver. I'd hesitate to buy again."
0,"I recived the ring with no problems, but was disappionted with the actual size of the Knot emblem. Would have liked it a bit bigger."
0,"This is a pretty bracelet and someone else might like it, but it didn't have enough sparkle for me."
1,Great craftmanship! Detail is incredible. Bought them for my Mother and she loved them!
1,"I love my gemstones and purchasing on-line can sometimes be quite tricky. With that said, these earrings are a wonderful find! I was pleased with the gem quality and the workmanship of the silver. These earrings are an excellent buy and would make a great gift. I would be interested in seeing my jewelry from this seller listed on Amazon."
0,I purchased the smiley face earrings for my daughter and after wearing them one time I was disappointed to find out that the smiley face was a sticker that came off! I tried putting the sticker back on but in the process it ripped. I was going to return the earrings for a credit but decided by the time I pay shipping it wasn't worth it. I can't believe they think their sticker is actually going to stay on.
0,"Do not even waste your money on these cheap piece of crap earrings! They are total crap, and because the shipping cost was just as much as the earrings themselves, it isn't even worth it to ship them back for a refund! I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased these, but found out quickly that you get what you pay for! When I opened the small bubble mailer that they arrived in, the posts were bent, and I found that I could easily bend the earring themselves as well! They are very light weight and there is nothing to them. Buyer beware of these earrings - when it comes to jewelery, it just pays to spend the extra money!"
1,I gave as a gift and it was received with enthusiasm! The color is true and the workmanship very good.
1,Well this is great. it's what i wanted. chain is 18 inch. great if you like shark pendant.
1,Absolutely loved the cufflinks. They were for my sons kindergarten graduation and he is obsessed with trains. He loved them! They arrived BEFORE I anticipated and I was delighted with the quality!
0,"the earrings were not same size--one end of the left one was longer than the right one. they also were unevenly twisted. the wire is so soft that I could shape the earrings myself just with my fingers. The balls at the end look much smaller compared to the spiral wire piece. Bottom line, no matter how I put them, they stick out to different sides. I definitely think that I overpaid big time for them. If I were to see them in the shop I would have passed on them."
1,"daughter really loved them, but when they came in contact with a hair product, they turned color which tells lme that are not real sterling silver."
0,"thought these were very unusual so i bought them .when they came i was surprised at how long they were. i kept them because i do like different things, but would have been nice to know how long they were."
1,"This was my first purchase of jewelry through Amazon. I have purchase many other products from Amazon, so I was pretty confident.I was not disappointed.The pendant looks very nice. I am happy to be giving this as a Christmas gift this year. As one of the previous reviewers said, it would be good to upgrade the packaging. I received the pendant in a typical jewelry box. It appears that the packaging changes from time to time."
0,I bought this for my dear lovely sister...however it was too small!!! in fact you can get similar design in stores at a dirt cheap rate..i had to return this.Full marks for amazon for their return policy!!!
1,"I was fortunate enough to access my email in time to take advantage of one of Amazon's Deals of the Day (or hour). I was able to purchase this for $189.99, and using a promo code I also had free shipping. I made the purchase on a Sunday and on Tuesday it was delivered by the UPS. WONDERFUL! The wooden box it comes in, makes a nice presentation, too."
1,"This necklace is a beautiful piece with nice stones. Not real big and gawdy, just the right size. I would recommend it highly. My wife loves it and wears it all the time."
1,I was very surprised and pleased when this product arrived earlier then the earliest estimated shipping date. The product is beautiful and of high quality. I highly recommend this product and any product from this manufacturer.
1,"Love the design, and is exactly as I'd hoped. Moves nicely and good fit / true to size. Also good weight to it, and clasp works well. Definitely recommend."
1,"After only doing this video once, I already loved it! It was exactly what I was looking for"
0,Be aware if you purchase this product that there are four small emeralds and one itty-bitty diamond chip in the middle. There are metal prongs where there should be other diamond chips. It's a bit deceiving. I guess I have a gift for my May baby niece.
0,"i like the ring very much..just the right size. i had it for about 3 months, and wore most days. One day I looked down and saw that one of the emeralds had fallen out. I had expected the ring to last longer."
1,"Very good quality. Cord is nice and comfortable. My honey loved it, looks great on her. I choose this for an anniversary present."
0,"I thought customer service was initially good. The first necklace was lost by FedEx. Another one was shipped. When I received it, it was suppose to have the double locking fold over clasp. It came with the lobster claw clasp. I was told the technician changed it in the product code but failed to change the picture to show the newer clasp. I wanted the double locking fold over clasp because in my experience they last longer than the lobster clasps. My acccount was credited, but they did not credit the $10.05 I spent to ship it back."
0,"This was a gift, and the person I gave it to loved it. The ring has a very classic design. It's manly without being in the least fussy. It's large enough to make a statement, without that statement being ""I am a made man."""
1,"These earrings look much much better in person!!! Good weight, shining, and not too long, not too short. The two ovals dangle a lot. It's probably the design, but to me, these earrings are inside out when you put them on. I love them more this way since they look different! Feel like a celebrity!"
1,The earrings are adorable! The colors are beautiful and such good quality. My granddaughter will love wearing them for school or a special event.
1,I like this earrings...they are cute and colorful and quant. i thought it was going to be bigger but its a good size not too big or small.
1,I very much like these earings. I got them for my sister and she loves them as well. They get noticed a lot because they are just the perfect size and they are so unique and unusual.
1,"Since receiving these earrings they havebecome one of my favorites. They are so lovelyin shape and color, everyone admires them.I recommend them to you all."
1,"These earrings have all my favorite colors. They are different, have lever backs and you can sleep in them. Couldn't ask for more they'll match just about anything you wear. Get the multi stone colors I kept leaning towards just the purple and blue. Glad I changed my mind. Great purchase."
0,It's way smaller than I expected. Beautiful color though. Taller ladies should be aware of the size of this pair of earrings.
1,These earrings are beautiful...the crystals just sparkle. They look more expensive than they are. Bought them with the bracelet for my sister and just love them.
1,"MY HUSBAND BOUGHT THESE AS A GIFT FOR MY BIRTHDAY. EVERYTIME I WEAR THEM, I GET COMPLIMENTS. I LOVE THEM. THEY LOOK EVEN BETTER WITH THE MATCHING BRACELET"
1,I love Swarovski jewelry!!! Gem Avenue has some really great ones and their prices are very reasonable! These earrings are really lovely and will look great on my baby! :)
1,"I really like these earrings and so far they haven't fallen apart like other earrings I've bought from Amazon. My best friend thinks I paid too much for them and she doesn't believe they are actual Swarovski crystals. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference, so I am not sure. All I know is they are beautiful."
1,"I received these fantastic earrings and immediately fell in love with them.They go with so many of my outfits,and I have received compliments every single time I wear them.They make me feel *with it* and *jazzy.*"
1,"Awww they are adorable...cute, I totally love this product!!great quality, more than expected!! I got them in 4 days andthey are stunning!...just can't wait to wear them."
1,It is very sparkly and has beautiful colors. Good craftsmanship. Shipping from this seller is very fast. I will definitely buy from them again.
1,They are very nice earrings and even better than the picture. Very vivid colous and you can wear them with almost everything! Great purchase at a great price!
1,"I have a chess club in my school, and this charm has a special meaning for me."
0,"Well you get what you pay for. Extremely light weight links are cheap, clasp the same broke first day. Looks very nice, however smaller then thought and the paws are hollow. Just no quality. Worth $12.00 at most. I'm half Native American and so is the wife and we both love the looks but that's as far as it go's. As part Native american I'm embarssed."
1,This is a beautiful brooch for anyone who loves nature and wildlife. Makes a great conversation piece!
1,These earrings are gorgeous. Very nice color and just enough bling. They're well made and just the right size. I ordered more in different colors.
1,"I have not had a chance to wear it. I bought both the pendant and the earrings. The earrings are nice and I have worn them. There are no signs of tarnish or discloration after wearring, unlike some other silver items that I purchased."
1,"If you can get this for the sale price of 60% off, dont hesitate! Just BUY IT! You wont be disappointed!I am in my late 20s, and own MANY pieces of jewelry... mostly white gold and diamond, so we can just say. I like nice things.This is definitely one of 'em and I was very surprised when I got these! They have a very nice weight to it, looks and feel very expensive, is VERY shiny and eye catching, and very well made..not to mention the design is definitely unique and different, yet sleek and stylish.Buying jewelry online is a hit or miss; I usually end up returning 50% of my internet jewelry purchase, but I am definitely keeping these! You wont see them on anyone else!I also bought the matching pendent."
0,The item was not as pictured. It is funky and of poor quality. The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this.
0,"The chain was smaller than I thought, and the Heart was bigger then I imagined.."
1,"For the money, you can't find a more beautiful pair of earrings. Sparkling, wonderful color, nice size - not too large, but can't be ignored!"
1,"These are so fun and totally useful-just as good with jeans as with a nice dress. Agree with some of the other reviewers that the color is slightly different in person than how it shows in the photos, they are a little darker and the shade of blue has a little green in it, but it's a pretty color so I still heart them. And the price is awesome for real diamonds in a gold setting. Also, the gold is white gold, which is sooooo much nicer than yellow gold! Great job Katarina!!"
0,"I ordered these earrings because I liked the light blue color in the several pictures on Amazon. I was expecting them to be a bit darker based on a few reviews. Theyre not BAD earrings if you were looking for DARK BLUE stones. Depending at what angle you look at them at and under what light, they look BLACK (someone else pointed this out) At best, they are a deep indigo, like DARK blue jeans. Thats not whats pictured! Since I was looking for something specific I wouldnt have bought these. Theyre not bad looking earings (although they do look smaller than whats on the model's ear photo) Just not what I was looking for.My biggest problem was packaging. Someone, in their infinite wisdom, stuck a label on the pretty blue box right under the bow. I tried and tried to carefully remove it but it was impossible because its a paper box. So I ended up RUINING the pretty box and Im now embarassed to give these to my wife in this box, so now I have to find ANOTHER box!!! THANKS KATARINA!!!!***12/21/11 UPDATE*** OK so a rep contacted me, without me having to contact them about the box issue and a new box was FEDEX'ed to me overnight. I ADDED a star to the review. Thank you! I see they changed the color of the earrings to more accurately represent the the actual colors.Once again, these look like nice earings, but I was looking for light blue stones which was shown on the age when I bought them."
1,My wife loves this and I am please with the sparkle and this shade of blue color. It makes them unique and quite attractive.
1,these are very lovely!! better than i expected. sparkly & the colors blue/green are really pretty!! i am pleased. they seem to be of good workmanship too.
0,"I was initially disappointed with the size-they were not exactly as pictured and upon first inspection, seemed too small. But"
1,"The ring is simply amazing! I love it!! the shipping took only 1 week, I live in Austria, I was happly surprised when i got it so soon!! I can only recommend this product!"
1,Love love love it! Its super cute!!! I just wish i could take off the bottom ball maybe i just have to try harder :)
1,I recently discovered Swarovski Crystals and fell in love. This necklace ia absolutally beautiful and an excellant bargin. I've priced these crystals other places and this is a superior product at a great price.
1,"I was a little hesitant to order these online.... The last time I ordered blue diamonds online (not from Amazon), they came so dark and cloudy that I returned them. Fortunately, these earrings are nothing like my previous order. These earrings are fantastic! Gorgeous color, great sparkle, better than I could have imagined! Highly recommended if you're looking for a pair."
0,"A present for my wife, she complained they were too large for the holes in her ears, but kept them."
1,"Very pleased, quick delivery, as described. This is a gift for a lovely young woman who is playing piano for us for the summer."
1,"I couldn't resist these earrings! I love lapis and wear it all the time, and the ferrets sealed the deal; how many earrings do you find with ferrets?? The design is really great; the ferrets are much more delicate than they appear in the picture above. The little tails curled around the lapis balls are just adorable.As the earrings are quite small, a girl (perhaps eight and up) could also wear these. Any age will find these adorable. I'd buy them if I was you! Thank you, Silver Insanity. I'll definitely be checking out more of your jewelry."
1,"This was even better than I expected it to be. I would have liked the chain to be a little heavier but for the price, it is really nice. It was a big hit with my mother, as it was a gift for her."
0,"I ordered six of these sets for a wedding I'm in next month. The are very pretty, but the sets did not come with matching chains. I was surprised because the set is entitled ""Earring and Necklace Set,"" not ""Earring and Pendant Set."" The picture shows the pendant on a silver chain, and the product description does not mention that a chain is not included.Looking back, I should have inquired to see if a chain was included. I recommend other buyers do the same if ordering similar sets."
0,"The silver scarab pendant I recieived does not have the darker coloration; it's entirely silver in color. I was also expecting it to be a bit weightier... the pendant is very, very lightweight. I was expecting a bit more rugged pendant. This scarab pendant would be nice for someone wanting a very lightweight, elegant pendant. It's a decent buy, and the shipping was fast."
1,I actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings. The 14k gold ones were the keepers! They are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears! Thanks to Amazon for this offering!
0,These are a joke. They are barely big enough to see and look more like a gag gift than real.
1,These are simply a wonder pair of earings. What a bargin.I would highly recommend them.
0,"I ordered these as a gift. Purchased a similar pair for myself, recently and was pleased with quality, but this pair had problems. Had to reorder TWICE (thank you Amazon!), but FINALLY got an acceptable pair, just in time. I disagree with the I1-I2 rating these have. I have purchased diamonds before and knew these were not ""top quality"", but the ones I received seemed far below any I1-I2 rated diamonds I've bought in the past. It seemed to always be a problem with one earring. Perhaps, Amazon could make sure these were better matched, as a pair. Also, these had noticeable scratches and divots on the face or table, which is the most visible part on a solitaire diamond. $100 is a lot of money for lesser quality diamonds. Setting and backs were fine. In the end, all is well; but I'm not sure I would order these again."
1,They look even better in real life than in the picture! Very happy with the quality and sparkle.
1,"This is a beautiful piece of art for the egg collector or geologist. The egg arrived exactly as promised, on time and simply lovely."
0,I wish I read the one review available before I purchased this. Just opened the one I ordered and this picture is misleading. It looks nice and somewhat bulky but it is super cheap looking. I am throwing it out instead of giving it to the person.
1,"very nice bracelet for the price...my wife loved it as a stocking stuffer! clasp seems a little weak,but only time will tell!"
1,"I'm a professional musician and bought these cufflinks to wear with my tuxedo at various concerts throughout the year. I've had them for about a year now, and I would have to say that they were well worth the price. (definitely better than the $200 or more alternatives) I have used them several times and haven't had any problems with chipping, breaking, etc. like some of the other reviews mention. Don't be scared off by some of the other reviews; these are great cufflinks and definitely worth the price. I highly recommend them."
0,"I needed some silver tone studs and links for a wedding. These fit the bill, looked nice, decent price, but the shafts of the studs broke the first time I removed them from my shirt (getting ready to send to dry cleaner). Waste of money!"
1,"I wear this necklace on a regular basis. It was exactly what I was looking for. Looks so real, not too big. I really like it."
0,These earrings are hard to latch. I ended up loosing one becuase they don't stay latched either. The quality isn't very good at all.
1,"These are great. They are very pretty, and easy to wear. I am a big ""hugger"" and they are so comfortable! You can sleep in them, shower, you name it....They are a great buy! Thank You."
1,I bought these as part of a gift for my Mother. They are adorable and so cute on. She loved them.
1,"I bought this ring as a wedding band to go with my wife's engagement ring. When I opened the box there was a ""wow"" moment. It was just the right ring and it looks beautiful next to the engagement ring. It also comes in a handsome box. I was a little skeptical about buying a ring like this on Amazon but the easy return policy made it worth it. We bought the wrong size initially but returned it for the correct one. The total cost was only the return shipping (about 3 dollars). We would have spent more than that driving around to jewelry stores trying to find something as nice and it probably would have been more expensive. The most important thing is that my wife loves it. I catch her looking down to her finger pretty often."
1,"I received this ring as an anniversary present from my boyfriend and I absolutely love it!!! It really does have a ton of sparkle! After reading the reviews, I did expect it to be shiny, but it certainly exceeded my expectations! I would definitely recommend buying this ring to anyone! Not only will it make a wonderful anniversary present, but it would make a beautiful wedding band as well. The ring is slim, elegant, very comfortable and definitely looks expensive (would have never guessed it is worth only $216)!!! I've been to many jewelry stores and to be honest, I did not find a single diamond band I liked and they were all at least $600. This one is perfect! I cannot stop staring at it, especially at the right light, when I almost get blinded by the rainbow-colored sparkles! My friends are so jealous! :)"
1,Very well-made; looks real; ended up buying more fr same vendor; why shop elsewhere.
1,"This bracelet is in a setting almost exactly like my wife's real one. I was surprised to see that the stones didn't look like a typical fake bracelet. Now, instead of being concerned of wearing her real diamond bracelet, she can wear this one all the time. And for the price, you can't beat it!"
1,"I have diamond tennis bracelets in white and yellow gold and this bracelet looks even better than the real thing. It sparkles beautifully, is well crafted and the price cannot be beat. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tennis bracelet, this is the one. THANKS FOR MAKING QUALITY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT AFFORDABLE PRICES!!"
1,"just received my bracelet and it looks great!!! love it!! you will not be disappointed at all!!!goes great with a watch, it's not fake looking"
1,"For the price, this is a very pretty cz tennis bracelet with a lot of sparkle. It is delicately made, so be sure to be careful when taking in on and off. The center clasp on mine has a tendancy to stick, so I find its helpful if I remember which side of the clasp to push down on. On mine it's the same side as the safety latch. This way you wont be tugging on it as much and since it is fragile don't wear it in bed or bend it much. As with any fragile or delicate piece of jewelry, (which practically goes for all solid gold jewelry now-a-days), you just have to be careful with it and it will last a long time. I recommend cleaning precious metal jewelry once bi-weekly if you wear it daily. Just warm water with a mild dish soap detergent usually works well. I would definately recommend this piece of jewelry to anyone thinking of buying it. Be gentle with it and check the tightness of the side safety clasps as soon as you receive it. If they seem loose at all you can tighten them by gently squeazing the sides in. If the side clasps fit snugly then it shouldn't fall off your wrist."
1,"This is a really beautiful bracelet. It looks so real, you would never know it is cz. It is the perfect size to be belivable. It is so sparkely and shiny. I wear it every day and get so many compliments. I highly reccommend this bracelet, you wont be disappointed!"
1,"I gotta admit it. After reading the reviews I still was skeptical, but this little bracelet is exactly as described and as appears in the pic. It is delicate, but NOT cheap looking. The length is good. The clasp is one of those lock on clasps that you always get with expensive bracelets. This gives it more credibility that it is real. Hey, what girl doesn't want to show off a pretty sparkly piece of jewelry that looks like the real deal....AND not pay much for it. At this price, treat yourself!"
0,"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful--much more brilliant and striking than I expected! However, the clasp is horrible. The clasp came undone and the bracelet slipped off my girlfriend's wrist (unfortunately in a busy public area...) the day I gave it to her. It really was tragic.However, it was such a beautiful bracelet for such a great price, I think I might order a replacement for her, and then try to figure out how to make the clasp more reliable.This product would definitely get 5 stars if the clasp were better."
1,"bracelet is beautiful -believeable, cz's are very sparkly. It compliments my current jewelry. However, the bracelet was returned within the week I had it. there's a prong broken off, and another piece that is unsoldered and will eventually break."
1,I love this earings i wore this every day they are beautiful and cheap.
1,"I bought this pair a long time ago, and they still look like new. Sturdy hinges, great ""glitz"", and the size is just right"
1,"I bought these for myself for my birthday, and must say they are perfect. They aren't too big to wear everyday. And they don't just blend in."
1,"awesome! i really love them, i haven't taken them off since i opened the package, which arrived 2 days early!! I was so excited to get them early, and my mom is very jealous...she wants a pair too.i get tons of comments every day on them, and i think they'd make a great gift!"
1,"I bought two pair of the same earrings so that when I next lose one I will have a spare(s).They are understated, elegant and suitable for wearing with any outfit, from casual to dressy. They look like the real deal (diamonds set in either white gold or platinum)."
1,"I really love this pair of hoops, they are at a size to wear I would feel comfortable wearing them everyday. I am going to be buying another pair for my second ear piercing."
0,"These are pretty, but very small- which is to be expected when you look at the measurement on the photo. But somehow I missed that when I originally decided to buy them. So that's my fault. What is not my fault is that the seller took 5 days from the time I ordered to process and finally ship them! The same day I bought these, I also bought 2 other items from different sellers. Those items both came before this one even shipped, and they were all shipped using standard shipping. That tells me that this seller is not up to par with the others. In any case, it should not take 5 days to process an order unless it is in a separate warehouse or on backorder. If that's the case, they never notified me I'd have to wait. Unfortunately for me, I suspect the items will still get here within the approximated time, so I won't be able to file a claim. This review doesn't have much at all to do with the product- it's the seller and their slow processing time. Even if the item still gets here ""on time"" it's the principal of the thing. You shouldn't order something and have to wait 5 days before they tell you it's finally shipping out- the item should already be there! Anyways, I still like Amazon, but it seems to be hit or miss with their marketplace stores!"
0,"I expected this product to be a little better than what it is (based on the picture). However, nothing special in it. It is quite small and not that eye-catching. But compared to the price I shouldn't have expected more than this."
0,"The CZ does not sparkle at all, I doubt it is even CZ at all. It looks like gumball plastic. One of the hoops broke about a week after wearing them. Shame because I liked the hidden lock. The design seemed good enough to be considered contemporary not cheesy but oh well."
1,"I am very happy with these earrings! Big enough to see, but not gaudy.. They are exactly what I wanted & I would not hesitate to buy again!!!"
1,Nice quality earring and the price is perfect. They are the earrings I wear most. I plan to buy another pair to give as a gift. Worth the money!
0,"I dont recomend it, these earrings are small, and the clasp broke already, im not happy.pleas try to correct this product for customer satisfaction,thank you ,sincerely Patty Figueroa"
1,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter and she loved them. However, a stone had dislodged in shipping. I called CoolStyles and they immediately sent her a new pair. They were pleasant to deal with and I certainly would order from them again."
1,"These close pretty securely and go well with everything. I have these in the second hole in my ears, and will usually wear something dangly in the first hole. Very nice choice."
1,"I love these earrings. Small chunky hoops, about an inch in diameter - the perfect size. Not to big but still large enough to get noticed. A very expensive look for something that isn't too costly.I like that the clasp is a clasp and not a post. These earrings are not going to come out. They are comfortable to wear, even to bed which sometimes I do when I forget to take them out.The silver goes with everything and the cubic zirconium looks enough like diamonds that people mistake this for the real deal."
1,"These earrings are a wonderful deal for the money. I can wear these earrings in my first hole, and my real 14kt white gold and diamond earrings in the second hole and they blend perfectly. That's what I call a good quality earring! Don't hesitate to buy, I'm picky and would not even write a review unless the item is outstanding. Buy with confidence :)"
1,My earrings would not latch when I received them. I sent a email to the sender they promptly responded to my request and replaced the broken ones in a timely matter.
0,On this almost 9$ pair of earrings SecureHoop charged me 30$ for shipping! That is outragious!
1,I don't know what that other person is talking about. Shipping was a dollar when I ordered the earrings. They're very petite and pretty; and they go with just about anything. I'm very happy with them.
0,"These came as described, and were great... For a few weeks. I used them for daily wear. Before long, the earrings would not stay clasped and the posts bent. Not worth the price, or the wait."
1,"i wanted to write a review on this product but i lost one of the earrings within 24 hours of wearing them. i was very very sad..... THEN!!! i found the earring in my garden but the clasp was not working properly and that's why it fell out of my ear.so, i contacted the seller and they sent me a new pair right away!what great customer service!!!!!the earrings are gorgeous!!!!beautiful and classy with anything you wear."
0,"Expected a little more on the packaging or presentation, they look just Ok to me, gf liked them for like a day to day basis usage."
1,"These earrings impressed me even before I got them out of the red silky pouch they came in. They have such amazing sparkle, much more than I expected. They will be perfect for any occasion, and I can't wait to wear them. My advice"
0,"It is bulky, ugly and useless. I sent mine back to tv boys, or whatever their name was, even though they charged me return shipping and acted like they were doing me a favor."
1,I received my ring and I just wanted to say a Big Thank You for the fast delivery and quality of your merchandise.Looking forward to ordering more items from you.Will recommend you to all my friends!
1,"2 pendants for the price of one, shiny and nice. Although it seems to only want to stay on the white side. Would that side be heavier? Whenever I wear the black..flips over to the white constantly. Didn't let that devalue my star rating, however, as they ship quickly, secure packaging and the items are quality."
0,"the pendant is much smaller than I expected,because it's so small and thick, it's hard for it to stay on one side,it will roll over,I will recommend other people don't choose this one,instead of another rectangle one,also has black onyx and mother of pearl reversible pendant,I brought that piece one in turquoise and lapis,another is carnellian one,they are much more beautiful than this one,big and bold."
0,Was excited to get these in the mail in time for St. Patty's day. Went to put them on and one of them snapped off of the clasp. Only reason that I am giving the 2nd star is because the return/refund process was so smooth.
1,"yeah I loved the ring but they gave me the wrong size, but in the end I was a good deal"
0,A little disappointed as ring has a lot of nicks & rough looking. The onyx looks more dark blue than black.You can tell it's not an expensive ring.
0,"Unfortunately, I also had a bad experience with this ring. I bought it for my husband's birthday the end of October and by Thanksgiving it already looked awful. He only wears it on the weekends because he can't wear jewelry at his work. Needless to say, I am now buying another ring."
0,"Although I very much like the LOOK of the ring, unfortunately in less than a week, the ring began to lose its shape because of the gap between the heads. Definitely not a ring that can be warn constantly and one that is easily lost or broken. Boo."
1,"Perfect for Harry Potter Death-Eater Cosplay!!!Well made, great detail."
1,"Roderick Tenorio Southwestern Sterling 14-Karat Gold Unisex Band RingThis ring is of the highest quality and I would recommend it for a man or a woman, and even as a wedding band!"
1,This is a very nice ring for the money! Very heavy and 6mm! Shipping was also very fast. I have worn it for a couple of weeks now and no dings or scratches.
1,"THIS BRACELET IS MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN I EXPECTED FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH AND I WAS THRILLED WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE AND SAW THE PURCHASE I HAD MADE. THE PRICE IS GREAT AND IT LOOKS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRICE REFLECTS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES STYLE, CLASS, AND FEMININE JEWELRY."
1,"Okay, what can you say about a tie bar. It clips and holds your tie in place. Of course you could say that about a clothes pin to... but this one looks better."
1,This product is exactly as cute as it looks and was used as a center piece in a bracelet for a dear friend-she wears it every day everywhere!
1,"I got this to replace a necklace which I lost years ago, and I couldn't be happier. It is very pretty, dainty, and elegant, and the filigree work is very detailed for something so small. I am actually considering buying another for backup, because the price is so very good for the quality of it! I love it, I am so happy with it. Also Silver Insanity ships super fast, I got my order within two days of ordering!"
1,These are by far the best chain extenders I own. Love the fact that they're in sterling silver. Very sturdy and well made. The three different lengths is just what I needed for different looks. Would highly recommend.
1,The necklace extenders I purchased were perfect. The shipping was very quick and reasonable. I am very pleased with my purchase.
0,"Yes this necklace is lovely, but it is extremely cheap. Less than 24 hours after I recieved it the opal fell out. I honestly don't even think it's real silver. It tarnished very quickly, and I had to gorrila glue the opal back in, and that helped it hold. Other than those it was a beautiful necklace and I got many compliments on it."
0,"The detailing is great, but it is very light....about the thickness of a dime. There's only enough silver behind the design to hold it into place & unevenly at that. The back is kinda lumpy, definitely not worth this kind of money. I agree with the previous reviewer, worth about $30."
1,I get from a friend in USAshe said she love it .. thanks
1,The person I gave it to hasn't taken it off yet! Sturdy and cute!
0,"I was kind of disappointed with this because it's really small. I don't think my toes are fatter than anyone else's but this ring cannot fit even near the base of my toe. I have to put it on the smallest part and even then the adjustable part doesn't come close enough to be secure. I can't even get it past the nail on my pinky finger. I have a feeling it will either break or im going to lose it. It also disappointing because I was looking for something that would be secure and sturdy. It looked in the picture like it would be something that would meet my needs. In reality, it's really just a sliver of silver that's tiny. It did, however, arrive pretty quickly."
1,I love the size of the box. Stays nice wrapping any item as a gift. Would love to see other than standard sizes. Thank you.
1,"I liked the look of this necklace a lot. The citrine was a very nice dark golden, not washed out and the garnets were a crisp red, not too dark as to look black. The design was different and looked great."
0,this lightweight necklace makes a very pretty statement..it adds just the right 'punch' to any solid basic colored ensemble...
1,i love this itemit looks really nice and everybody who saw it said looks really good. It was on time too
0,"The pendant painted not perfect, but looks good enough for this money."
1,"Nice big thick ring - just as pictured. Nice shine to it, too."
0,Expected it to be larger. Will pay more attention to gram weight/price in the future. It would be fine for a teen.
0,Ordered for my wife and gave to her for our anniversary. She likes them but one diamond chip was missing. Amazon indicated you had no more available and offered a 'return'. Elected to keep and had a local jewler replace the chip. Similar earrings in local stores were three to ten times the price so I cannot complain. I think the 'fix' only cost about $20.
1,I have just received my new earrings and so far I love them. The stone is really pretty and the stem of the earing is quite long which I personally like because the earring will stay on tight without coming close to pinching my ear. I bought these to use as my everyday earrings and needed something sterling silver so my ears wouldn't get infected. These are perfect so far. I did see one other review that said the earrings broke. I will post an update if they do indeed break.
0,"I bought this pair of earrings for my daughters birthday, and was very happy when I got them. I gave them to her and she went to put them on and the post broke, she was really sad....would not recomend them to anyone....."
1,"This chain is tougher than many chains, it looks nice, fits nice and is made of silver. I put a pendant from another necklace where the chain was too flimsy, I like this one much better and I fee it should last a long time."
0,I have to clean it every time I wear it. It is not sterling .925. I have a lot of sterling and have never had this happened to me. So not worth the money :(
1,"Great chain bought several.....Sterling Silver Snake 1.4mm Chain Necklace 20""....great price nice quality!~Very Happy with purchase!~I recommend this chain great prime item!"
1,These are ideal for an everyday look or if you want a simpler look. Small but noticeable. They are worth the price for sure.
1,This ring was exactly how the write up described it. I have worn it everyday since I got it.
1,"Perfect size, more shine than photo, high quality feel, heavy weight sterling silver. Size is perfect, great value for price. Will definitely order more from this seller."
0,"Do NOT purchase this item! It does not fit properly on the ear, and when you try to wear it it falls off. In the picture it also depicts the cuff as larger than it actually is. I would not recommend this for anyone."
1,This is a great item for someone who wants to add a little extra to their look.The item arrived on time and is good quality.I looked at this a few times before finaly deciding to purchase and I am glad I did buy it. I am very happy with my purchase and would recomend it to anyone.
1,"This ring is unique, beautiful and LARGE! I have very large hands, and it's even big for me! When I had it sized at my jewelers, even they said WOW. The quality of the amethyst is fantastic, and the design holding the stone is so unusual.The sellers were extremely helpful and went out of their way to make sure I was satisfied. I'll buy from them again!"
0,"I really like this size ear ring. It shows my preference but does not overpower anyone at work. However, this has a quality control problem, The Yin-Yang symbol is not always correct. The dots are off of the fishes are misshaped in about a third of the ones I purchased. I ended up buying several more pairs than I needed in order to ensure I got enough good quality ones."
1,"These are the tiniest, cutest things ever! My only complaint is that the back fell off one of them, on the first day, and I almost lost the earring! Other than that, they are too cute and perfect to give anything less than 5 stars!"
1,I've been looking for a longer anklet for awhile and was so pleased when I saw this. The price is great and the anklet is beautiful. Very shiny and good durability. 
1,It is exactly as described...Love it! Received it quickly...easy transaction. I would highly recommend this to others. Thanks very much!
0,"I was disappointed when it arrived. First of all it was tarnished. The silver had black lines all around it after just coming out of the package and I understand silver does do this overtime but it should not do it before I even get it. And the 10"" was way to big. Just disappointed in general. Hopefully Amazon will give me a refund and I can buy one elsewhere."
1,Loved the anklet. The first time I wore socks I forget I was wearing it and broke the clasp when I removed my socks. Accidently hooked the chain and yanked too hard. Totally my fault. I will be ordering another one.

0,"A story below,Attn"
1,"This is the third pair of earrings that I have bought from this seller, and I have been satisfied with each purchase. I was looking for dark purple amethyst. While I prefer a real stone I wanted to make sure that I got a dark purple stone to match a AA amethyst stone in a pendant I own. The stone is a nice dark purple and is sparkly. The silver is good quality and is sturdy. This was true of the other two pairs of earrings I bought as well. The price is definitely fair."
1,"These earrings were even prettier than I expected. Nice length, and great tiger eye color. Good for casual or dressy occasions."
1,"lovely, the packaging could be a bit classier but the earrings are beautiful and look well worth the price. a good deal"
1,look nicer in person. Nice item for the money. look better than expected. If you like tiger's eye you should be very pleased with this item.
0,I bought this pendant as a gift for my daughter. Pendant was received in a timely manner. Very pretty but crystal fell out within weeks.
0,I ordered this product for my wife. It is larger than I expected. The quality is ok. I'm not sure if I will order this type of jewelry without seeing it in person first.
1,This is really a good buy for such a beautiful smokey quartz stone. It's just as pretty as advertised and I highly recommend this purchase. I have two large (stand alone) smokey quartz stones but this is my first purchase of the stone in the ring setting. Wonderful.
0,"Overall these are disappointing. First, the length is smaller than advertised, under 1 3/16 inches, that is about 30mm, as compared to the advertised 35 mm in the product specifications table. More importantly, unlike the photo, the ""blue"" topaz is so pale as to look white rather than blue. The result is that the stone blends in so completely with the silver that it is essentially invisible except under very close up examination. In fact, at first I thought there was no stone at all.On the plus side, they are fairly sturdy and feel like good quality, but I shall have to make an emergency trip to the mall for a different gift."
0,"when worn with the other necklaces that it is supposed to go with, it gets EASILY tangled... I also tried doubling up the necklace and it did OK, but once again it did get a little tangled up."
1,I was very pleased with this transaction. It arrived in a timely manner and was just what I had expected. Am recommending this vendor to all.
0,"I bought this piece several months ago and have worn it several times, though I am not personally crazy about a ""lariat"" style of necklace. I would have liked it better if it were just a circular choker. In fact, I have decided to take it apart and make a choker using leather cording and the ""poppy"" shells.The only problem I have with it as a necklace is that some of the beading string can be seen in between two of the flowers. I would suggest using a permanent marker in either orange or red to color any part of the exposed string, (which looks dirty, btw...probably from string wax or something). Otherwise, it is rather lovely. The colors remind me of tangerines and blood oranges. It has an extender chain, so I imagine it should be able to fit any size neck."
1,"WOW! This stunning show stopper gets me rave reviews, and NO ONE suspects it is not real! It is VERY convincing! It is sure to bring you loads of compliments. Be warned, it is not for the shy among us!"
1,"This necklace is great - a little darker than the photo online. It's a perfect fall/autumn necklace. Good quality, great packaging, and it comes directly from Amazon, no 3rd party dealers."
1,Very solid. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Not chincy at all. Looks good too.
0,The necklace would not lay flat...the strand was slightly wavy instead of straight. Just truly uncomfortable.
1,I LOVE these earrings... I think I actually ordered them/got them from here maybe 2 years ago... I wear them nearly everyday... these ram's head earrings have always been my favorite... they are hard to find if you DON'T want yellow gold (I would like a pair in white gold too) but these particular ones are holding up perfectly I love them!
1,"I bought these for my wife for a Christmas Present along with three other pairs of earrings. Even though these cost less than the other pairs, she gravitated to these immediately. They are very attractive and are big enough that they make a statement. Buy them; you won't be sorry."
1,"I have a large emerald cut diamond solitaire and this gel cleanser is sure to make everyone notice it. I think it sparkles more than when the jeweler cleans it. The brush that comes with it works well. This was a good purchase. This is a must have. It is part of my routine to clean my ring everyday before leaving the house. It really allows you to see the flawless nature of the rock you are sporting. Sorry, I like to make the girls at the office jealous :-)lol"
1,"This ring is really comfortable for a wide band, as the back of it narrows. I get lots of compliments on it too."
1,I THINK THIS RING HAS GREAT QUALITY. The engraving on the ring is extraordinary. Exceptional quality with a thick band. Perfect gift for a friend or yourself.
1,"I ordered this charm for my Twilight bracelet. While the description says ""cougar"" I thought it would be a nice representation of a Mountain Lion which is, as we all know, Edward Cullen's favorite vegetarian vampire meal (spoiler alert) and Bella's first vampire meal. The sizing is perfect with all of the charms I ordered from ""Runs with Vampires"". This is a lovely addition to my Twilight charm bracelet."
0,"I personally rarely spend much money on jewelry. I thought this item looked like a fun finger toy to have, so I bought it. I don't regret buying it, but I wouldn't buy again. It is fun to spin, but doesn't spin very well. Soap gets caught into it, and it is such a hassle to clean! Buy this if you have a lot of money in your pockets and you want to waste it."
1,"Looks exactly like it did in the description picture. It spins really well!!! Great little ring. I love it. Which is a good thing since its my wedding ring. But yeah, it's beautifully made as usual. I've never gotten a bad product from Silver Insanity."
1,Comes in a cute black gift box with a bow. Also included was a tulle pouch to store the necklace in if desired. Perfect gift item!
1,Bought this for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! It's the perfect addition to her collection and it's a fun way to show team spirit. The quality is great and I would highly recommend it for any Braves fan.
1,"just received both my bracelets, one in multi and the other in lime green. I like them both a lot. I'm a fan of green and was pleased with the color as well as the multi."
0,This necklace was a X-mas gift and it took quite a while for it to arrive after X-mas.
0,"Very disappointed, tie tack is very small compared to picture that is shown . Expected it to be larger the price was a little steep but it was purchased for my teenage son who loves eagles. would not order from this company again"
0,"A word of warning. Totally don't get this if your girlfriend's or wife's name begins with a letter other than ""C."" And if you do accidentally get it, and she gets mad, don't shrug your shoulders and say, ""eh, close enough."" It's just not a good idea."
1,My mom ordered this because she had heart surgery a few years ago. Loves wearing it. Does not bother her or fade. Great great purchase!
1,I recd these earrings very quickly...they are very pretty and dainty and sparkle and pick up colors like a prism....the price is right too....i ordered others in the same style but different color combinations....thanks
1,"We bought this ring as my husband's wedding band. I loved how they combined the silver and gold to make it more affordable! The ring is beautiful in person and we were highly satisfied! The ring is a thick band and looks wonderful on my husband's hand. The fit was perfect. We did get sized at a jewelers for comfort fit rings. Customer service was wonderful and worked with me concerning size, and shipping was fast!"
1,"My husband was looking for a two-tone wedding band when we recently got married and the costs at most stores were outragious. He wanted quality and affordability, and this ring offered both. It was sent fast, arrived in really nice packaging, and he really loves it. If you are looking for something like this I'd recommend this seller."
0,"Bought this ring for my husband for a Christmas present. He hated it!! Thought it looked like a piece of jewelry from a 25 cents vending machine. Had to wait over 10 days to reach someone by phone since the company was closed. The first person took a message and never called back. The description and picture in no way fit what we actually received. It is certainly not stunning. When we actually talked to someone about returning it, we were hit with a 35% restocking fee because the ring was ""custom made to our specifications"". What a joke!! This is the worst item I have ever ordered from the amazon site since I began using it several years ago. Will never order from this company again."
1,Everything about the transaction and product was great. Make sure you know your ring size first. Here are some more words to make this review long enough.
1,The ring was exactly what I expected it to be. It fit perfectly and arrived promptly. I couldn't ask for more.
1,"VERY GOOD RING, GREAT SHIPPING SPEED, AND IS EXACTLY THAT WAS EXPECTED A PERFICT PRODUCT"
1,I'm rally happy with the ring. I'm glad to say that i had a very good experience with you and ofcourse that i would by again from you thank you very much!!!
0,"I really like the customer service, and the box it comes in is absolutely adorable...however, the ring is not at all what I expected. A little smaller than I expected, and the top...well, the little circle thing with the knot inside? Well, it juts out so far, that it reminds me of one of those Egyptian signet rings. I almost dipped it in wax to see if it would leave an imprint on an envelope! The design is great, except for the fact that the top juts out and I haven't gotten any compliments on it, except for my Mom's. Ah, I would not really recommend this ring, unless you wouldn't mind it looking like a signet ring. It is real silver, though, and very glossy and shiny, so I would give it a three star rating. Just my personal opinion."
1,The ring fits my finger beautifully! It is gorgeous! I love it! Gorgeous Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
1,"This ring is exactly what I wanted, I actually bought another and it wasn't quite as solidly made as this ring is. Thanks for the great ring!"
1,"I ordered this ring because I was really impressed with the detail shown in the picture. But when I got it, I was even more impressed. It is absolutely beautiful. High shine and beautiful craftmanship. And the price was amazing! I would definitely recommend this ring to anyone who loves celtic jewelry."
1,"Bought this ring to wear on my pinkie. It is well made, shiny, and perfect. I am extremely happy with it."
1,I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design. I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase. This is an excellent deal for your money!
1,"Great ring! I bought it for myself and its just wonderful. Sturdy ring, beautiful design. I would highly recommend this ring to anyone who likes celtic jewlery."
1,"I just got this in the mail today, and I am quite pleased. I had seen this bracelet several times and wanted to buy it except for the fact that it is advertised as only 7 inches long, which, for me is not loose enough - I usually wear 7.25-7.5 inch bracelets. This is the best-looking Hamsa bracelet out there, so I finally bit the bullet and bought it with the intention of adding an extender. However, when I got the bracelet and put it on, not only did it fit well, I had room like I do with the bracelet sizes I mentioned above that I prefer! So I would say that the length is incorrectly advertised. In fact, in measuring mine out, I am coming up with it being just shy of 7.5 inches, or about 18.9 centimeters. It really is a lovely bracelet, and yes, it's delicate, but I wouldn't say it's too fragile to wear. Just use some caution, but all in all, a good buy."
1,Fast shipping and great product. Just what I expected and it looks just like it does in the picture (which is not always the case). I would highly recommend this product to anyone..in fact I am wearing it now!
1,"I bought these earrings for my nine year-old niece who is obsessed with peace signs. She just got her ears pierced and they are still quite sensitive, so I wanted a pair of earrings that her ears could tolerate. These are perfect! Just the right size for a child, too."
0,"These earrings are a little thin and more delicate than I expected. They will be fine for my ten-year-old daughter, for whom the earrings were purchased, but I was a little disappointed when I opened the box."
0,"The item arrived on time but is very thin and broke after our daughter wore it just a couple of times. We didn't contact the seller because the piece fell and we didn't have much of the earring to send back. In addition, we waited a few weeks to give it to our daughter so by the time it broke the return period expired. Very bummed about this product."
1,"I bought this ring for my little finger and it looks great there. I agree with the reviewer that the metal is thin, but I guessed that by looking at the picture and it doesn't bother me. In my opinion the ring looks good, fits well, and is all sorts of shiny so I'm pleased with it."
1,I am very satisfied with the purchase i made. i do not take the ring off because it looks so great with everything...buy it.perfect size and cut
0,the material the ring is made from is a little too fragile. otherwise its ok
0,"I got this ring and I never wear it. The sizing is smaller than it saids. And the turquoise stone stick up way to far, the one time I wore it it got caught on everthing!"
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product both heart and chain. Excellent price for the productFlawless Sterling Silver Floating Heart, 13/16"" X 13/16"""
1,This is a wonderful piece of jewelry. I am happy I got this as a gift for V-Day. It is simple but very stylish and classy.
1,"My husband gave me this necklace for our last anniversary. It's beautiful, shiny, substantial without being heavy, and very uniquely shaped. It's classy looking and I wear it more than any other necklace. It looks good on any kind of chain too."
1,"This piece is simple, yet striking! Perfect size and looks great with anything from casual to dressy, I highly recommend!"
0,"Why you may wonder I wrote this tittle, nice, well to tell you the truth I brought this chain to my girlfriend and she was pleased, indeed, sadly the chain has a mayor issue, its weak and can break in a hearthbeat, yes I still have the chain but as you may guess already it's broken."
1,"The chain alone is great, very sturdy. the Heart is flawless and very beautiful. My girlfriend loves it. what more can i say? its a great necklace. very much worth the money, but for her i would have paid more for this beaut."
1,This looks absolutely beautiful on our 18 year old granddaughter. She wears it all the time. Highly recommend for any age. We bought the Sterling Silver Guardian Angel Pendant for her twin sister. Both are beautiful necklaces.
1,I bought this for my girlfriend for a Christmas and she absolutely loves it. Never takes it off!!
1,The necklace looks great when wearing it. The length is perfect. The chain is a snake or rope style so it does not kink or break like typical link changing will.
1,The simplistic beauty of this pendant is priceless.I love the Chain it comes with. Smooth as Silk on your skin. Looks pretty w/ the Heart Charm or worn alone. Makes for an easy glide of the pendant. No kinks or pulls of the skin or hair.The Floating Heart is a nice sized Piece.Lovely addition to your pendant collection.Basic Beauty.Love it!!
1,Sterling Silver Floating HeartThis floating heart is lovely. I purchased it for my wife for part of her Christmas present and I'm sure she will love it. Sabrina Silver offer faultless service and I can't complain about the product quality or service from Sabrina Silver.Thank you
1,i bought this as a gift and examined it closely upon deliveryi wished i had purchased another for myselfit was just beautiful!
1,"I ordered this necklace on a Tuesday, and got it on Thursday. What a fast response. But, the best thing was seeing it. If you love sterling silver, this is a must have. It is beautiful. The heart glides on this absolutely stunning snake chain. It sparkles and shines like no other I have ever seen. This is the necklace I will wear as my signature piece. I love it!J.P."
1,"It's as beautiful as it looks online, even better in person, don't usually wear necklaces but this is just the right size and have received many comments on how lovely it is, glad I bought it."
0,Pretty flimsy bookmark for the amount of money. Jewel broke off immediately after purchase. It looked nicer in photo.
1,"While I was not entirely thrilled with the choices of color or texture for many of the bags, I still felt their physical designs were useful and inspirational. Although the book is actually intended for practitioners of crochet, the line drawings would easily suggest amendments that could make them useable for knitting as well.The most innovative thing about the ""book"" is that it isn't one. The format is that of a box containing individual, plastisized folded cards, each displaying a pattern and its instructions. I found this a useful facet, since I enjoy taking my handwork when I go to work or if I expect to wait anywhere for a while. The light weight cards mean one doesn't have to carry a book or magazine with one. The coating on the cards also means that the patterns are safe from crumpling, water damage, and sticky fingers, something I was especially impressed with since often my loose leaf patterns get a little beat up even in plastic sleeves.For those of you who like beading, take note of some of the handles. While most of those displayed are commercial handles, there is no reason one could not produce the same results with beads in glass, metal, ceramics, stone or bone. You might use one of the bags to showcase your handiwork in beading.Button enthusiasts might also use one of the bags to display their favorites. My mother had a set of 5 ivory buttons with sculpted faces on them that my father purchased for her in Japan in 1952. I have since inherited them, and I've wanted a way to show them off. I've plans to create a handbag and display it with the buttons in a shadow box.One of the bags is composed of simple granny squares, but those of you who are big into crocheted afghans may have designs you like better with which to construct that particular bag. There are tons of crocheted block designs out there with which to experiment and no reason why the bag could not be constructed of them, so experiment and see what you come up with.An interesting and useful formate with inspiring ideas to create truely individual hand bags."

1,The locket is very nice and have received compliments. I have miniature photos of my family in the locket. Good price and value. Packaged nicely and sent timely. Will buy from them again.
0,"The pendant is nice; however, it's not nearly the color in the advertized photo. It's more yellowish in color. I would prefer the darker shade, since the features in the jasper seem to stand out more clearly. I was pleasantly surprised that a chain came with it. I've worn it almost incessantly since receiving it. It's a good deal for the price!"
1,Its a really nice piece of jewelry. So far the color hasnt faded so it good. Looks really good in :)
0,"Personally I didn't like it and my piercing started to get infected although I disinfected it and cleaned my piercing. Didn't happen with my other jewelry, just this one."
1,This is a charming locket. It is a good size and the smooth area is perfect for engraving. You couldn't buy costume jewlery for this price. Will make the perfect gift!
1,"I bought this for my seven year old daughter for Christmas and she was quite pleased with it. It is compact once you open it up, so the space for the photos is small- maybe a half-inch diameter inside. For a larger person you might opt for the next bigger size pendant, so you can better view whatever photos you put in there. Whoever wrote that it didn't come with a chain was misinformed - it does."
1,The locket was just as the descripition said it was. Putting a picture in was at first a challange but all in all it was a great item.
1,Can't beat the quality and price for these onyx and silver post earings. Is actually even nicer than what looks on line. Very pleased with purchase
1,"I received these earings rather quickly and when I opened the box, they were just as I imagined. They are light and delicate. The earing is also three separate pieces so its cute when it dangles because the three pieces move. Also, you get what you pay for because the color seems to be painted on and I hope over time it does not fade away. Nonetheless, I like them and would recommend purchasing these earings. I have received many compliments on them :)"
1,One of my photography jobs didn't allow us to wear jewelry (get with the times!) and with these in most people couldn't even tell that I had piercings. Make sure you get the right ones for your skin tone.
1,"When I'm wearing metal or wood plugs I cannot rest my head on my hand (small problem I know). With these I forget they are in, they are just more comfortable. Best yet, they actually blend into my ear pretty well from a distance which is important because I work at a hospital. Just be aware there are something like 3 shades, this shade works for me and I'm relatively light skinned."
1,I bought these for my 9 month old daughter. She has had them on for about two weeks straight now with no problems at all.1. We've gotten tons of compliments on them.2. They stay put.3. They fit snuggly around the earlobe5. Doesn't dangle - Reduces the risk of getting pulled out.6. Sparkles.7. I have no complaints.
1,"I'm very please with this set, just as pictured, very good quality. Simple, understated, perfect sized unlike some that stand out way too much. Perfect for the extra touch of class."
0,"I am looking for a small hoop earring with a locking closure -exactly like this product.Since I participate in different sports, some involving helmets, I have been desperatelysearching for a style that was comfortable (no posts sticking out the back)and secure (one that I couldn't lose) during sports; yet simple and elegant.I also wanted one I could leave in during a shower or sleep that wouldn'ttarnish (hence white or yellow gold) or fall out.I like a matte finish and don't really care for cheap diamonds. The styleI chose had diamonds that were so small, I thought they compromisedthe look to the point that it would have been much better without (I didn't see anyon their site without diamonds).The style"
1,I ordered these as a Christmas gift. I was suprised how big they were. I was very happy with them and they were a big hit!
0,"I bought this ring for my soon to be husband for his wedding band. He wanted something different like carbon fiber but he has very large fingers and most rings don't come on his size. The ring arrived and I was very pleased with the appearance however it did scratch fairly quickly, within a month. The scratches were small and not that noticeable. Nice enough for the money but you couldn't wear it every day."
1,This is an amazing ring; I gave it to my boyfriend because we plan on spending our lives together and this was kind of a forever ring. He never had an all black ring and that is his favorite color. It was the best gift I could have given him. THANK YOU!!!
0,Nice pc but ring is not the size it said it was but I like it. Works 4 me
1,"This ring is very beautiful. The picture doesn't do it justice. They turned out much better than my fiance and I expected. We wanted something somewhat ""goth"" looking and non-traditional and these were perfect. We love them!The only problem I have with the ring is that it scratches fairly easily. I got a scratch on it the first day I wore it and I wasn't even doing anything that would cause such a thing, so you do have to be careful with it because it does scratch up real easy.Otherwise, it's a gorgeous ring and we love them."
1,This jewelry set is very beautiful. I love the elegant long drop of these earrings.
0,The insert piece to lock in the earring broke. I never even got a chance to wear them so I was a little disapointed.I really love the style of this earrings. Can you send me a new pair?Thanks for your concern on this item.
1,"The quality of the earring is superb. It is a very life-like depiction of a real feather, albeit in a minature form. The feather can be rotated so that you can wear it pointed up, to the side or down. If you are considering these, just keep in mind the size and compare the mm to a similar earring you already own. They are smaller than they appear in the picture, but still NOT tiny for stud earrings. Given their quality and price point, their size is more than generous. Go ahead and order right now. You will be happy you did!"
1,"For the price, I think this piece is the best you can get. 1928 is a good company with fast delivery time, and this particular piece is even more beautiful and unique than it looks in the picture. Overall, a fantastic buy. The organza/chain twinning was especially pretty."
1,"I ordered this necklace as a Christmas present for my niece. It came quickly, nicely packaged, and she loved it.... and the earrings I got her from 1928 Jewelrey too."
1,"I just wore these tonight after receiving them the other day, and they were the first clip-on earrings I have worn that didn't feel pinchy - I could barely tell they were there at all! And they are so pretty and sparkling without being too gaudy. A good balance between delicacy and being noticeable. I love the way they swing and sway. As someone who can't wear pierced earrings, have never found any clip ons that were comfortable, and loves the look of pretty earrings on other people, I am so happy to have found this. I will definitely look for others from this maker!"
1,"These are great little earrings. And by little, I mean ""tiny"" - they are only 9mm long. I like wearing mine to work - it shows everyone what I'd rather be doing!"
1,"I really like these earrings, the green and black are very beautiful. I did put tighter backings on them though and clipped the posts shorter so they stay on tighter and dont stab."
0,I bought this item for my soon to be hubby it was so small i could have just threw it in the trash.
1,This is a really gorgeous piece. I don't usually wear such large jewelry or much jewelry at all but this one is a great one to wear.
1,"This is a lightweight beautiful and original piece of wearable art. The phoenix, most recently of Harry Potter fame, was also an early Christian symbol of the resurrection. As has been noted previously, it does not come with a chain. I paired it with a black cord which looks great. I have bought several things from this company and have been very pleased with the service and quality of their products and look forward to future purchases."
1,"I was looking for a new pendant, something to signify big changes I am making in my life, something to wear as a reminder of my ""rebirth."" I love this pendant. It is a nice size and weight, the edges are smooth and it is comfortable to wear. The matching earrings are small and probably won't get used much, but this will get lots of wear."
1,"Got this pendant about a month ago and, once I tracked down a chain I was happy with, have worn it every day. After going thru a series of personal tragedies last year, looking at this phoenix symbolizes and reminds me of the new beginnings and rebirth in my life.Well, back to the phoenix. It's well crafted and I LOVE the design. While the image on Amazon is very good, it really doesn't convey the intricate details on this pendant. Looking at it, you can see the attention to detail that went into the design. From every feather on the wings to the eyes and beak on the head (the triangle at the bottom)Excellent service and prompt delivery from Silver Insanity. Would be happy to do business with them again (and I already have since)."
1,"The necklace was gorgeous and very detailed, it is not too big and not too small so it is just the perfect pendant to wear during special occasion."
1,"My pendant came today and I am very happy with it. It looks lovely on a 16"" black silk cord. It's the perfect size, not too large, and the curves soften the effect. I wore it today with a turquoise V-neck T-shirt, and the effect was striking, but not even remotely gaudy. Very good value. Silver Insanity was very prompt with delivery."
0,"a few days later I asked to see her new earrings.""I'm not wearing them"" she said.""Why not?""""They broke.""They broke, both of them at the clasp, the day after Mother's Day--the day after I gave them to her."
1,"These earrings are just what I was looking for. Make no mistake, they are pretty big, but that's exactly what I was looking for. I've had them for 2 months now and wear them a lot and they are still nice and shiney!"
1,"Beautiful sterling silver hoops! Love the hinged closings! Big but not too big even for my 5'2"" frame!"
0,"Somehow the photo makes the earrings appear thicker, wider than they actually are, a disappointment."
0,Well this is the first thing that I bought off of Amazon and I can say I was honestly unsatisfied. This really seemed to be cute and I thought it would be a great Christmas gift fo my daughter. Well it broke the same day she got it. Thanks a lot........
1,"These earrings are subtle and elegant; beautiful brown stones to compliment office attire or evening wear. Can't speak to the shipping experience because I received them as a gift, but I love the earrings."
1,"This is a lovely celtic-inspired design, a little less intricate than most celtic cross pendants, but perfect for the girl with more conservative tastes."
1,"I saw a similar chandelier earring at a store and was shocked at the price. This pair from 1928 is not only well made, but gorgeous! It is stunning and has just the right amount of sparkle. It would look great with hair down or up. They are not overbearing at all and very light weight. I'm glad I ordered them because they look vintage and look terrific with jeans or dresses."
1,"I'm very picky about earrings and I hardly likes any, but I really like these! They look very pretty and they are very light. They have a lighter color in reality, they look much nicer than in the picture I think."
1,"I just LOVE everything I have purchased from 1928 Jewelry. Everything is of a great quality, arrives in a timely manner and is packaged well.These were a little smaller than expected, but I many not have read the full description for them."
1,"I HAD LOST ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO AND COULDN'T FIND THEM AGAIN, AND WHEN I SAW THEM ON AMAZON, I WAS THRILLED!! MANY MANY COMPLIMENTS."
1,"These earrings are really great and came out as I expected. Silver quality is good and pattern is clear. Yet you need to have eagle eyes to notice, since they're really small. I checked the product info to see that I have missed the measurements but there isn't any. So it might be useful to notice the hooks are almost larger than the circles."
1,"I wear this alot, its nice, metal, not some cheap stuff. Also I am a huge fan of Naruto."
0,"You want my input? I'm giving you it!My fiancee ordered directly from Evesaddiction.com because they had a free shipping weekend, where amazon would have charged.Unfortunately we made the mistake of ordering directly from them rather than through amazon.com.We had to cancel the order because we had came accross something and we weren't sure about it.. than after double checking we decided to contacted evesaddiction.com.they went ahead and canceled the order but had told us that we would need to re-order the rings since the order number was no good.We went ahead and did so, and after almost a week now.. not only have our rings not arrived yet.. the order that we had canceled turned out was never canceled and they charged our bank account twice and refuse to refund unless we ship back their product!I'm a little nervous about that because i'm not even sure we'll see that 53 bucks that was charged extra to our account even if we do send them back their package.You want my advice? Order directly through amazon... they would have taken care of this problem long before any of this crap happened."
0,"This ring is fine - the size fit me perfectly. It's very light weight (which I like), and it fits well (size 11 really is size 11). However, it scratches much more easily than I was expecting, given it is titanium. I really like the color, just a little darker than white gold. For the money, an ok deal..."
1,I bought this ring for Valentine's Day for my daughter. It is a lovely ring and well worth the cost. She loves it.Service from the seller was excellent. Expedited delivery great.
1,This was a gift and was received with much appreciation. It is difficult to find petite clip-on earrings for my aunt and these were perfect!
1,"i bought these for a friend of mine that does not have pierced ears, they are dainty and very pretty, usually clip earrings are cheap and look it, but these are lovely and worth much more than the price amazon charged, my friend loved them!"
1,"The necklace is stunning once it's out of the package...the pearls on mine are more white than cream (shown in the picture) but still gorgeous nonetheless. The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed. Delivery was unexpectedly fast. It was definitely worth the money."
1,I was quite pleased with this pendant and so was the recipient! The stone sparkles very well and the silver is very delicate. This is perfect for someone with exquisite yet subtle tastes.I would definitely buy this product if I had it to do over again. Peora is the best jewelry seller on Amazon!
1,Very inexpensive and fits me nice. I bought one for my daughter as well. She looks beautiful in it. The price is right and Red Coral color is amazing.
0,"I bought this as a gift for my goddess daughter. Unfortunately, it is completely illegible--worse than pictured. You can't make it out, even when staring at it up close, let alone on someone's neck."
1,I love these earrings! I can wear with casual black outfits or more dressy type wear. I highly recommend this.
1,"I bought this for my husband's birthday and he loved it. Unfortunately, I was unsure of the size and the 15 was a little too big. He should have had a 14 and maybe even a 13. The ring was lost one cold day when he was raking leaves. We think the ring went into a trash bag, never to be seen agin.That is my fault though so I say to please get sized to ensure proper fit. Obvious advice but still good.I loved the dragon silhouette. It's nice looking in it's simplicity and you can still tell what it is. I say a great buy for dragon lovers at a great price."
1,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He has an allergic reaction to some metals, so I was pleased to find a titanium ring that was priced well and intricately designed. The carvings are very nicely done, and the finish in the ring is superb. And the seller was very helpful when we had to do an exchange for a bigger size. Overall, a good buy."
1,"I received my order quickly and in great condition. The ring is very well made, heavy and the design is cool. High recommendations for quality and service."
1,"Ever since I have started wearing this, I have been asked questions about autism. Because it is bold - it is a great conversation starter. One of the reasons I wear it is to create more awareness. This does that. It is eye catching and beautiful. I have been asked by many people where I found this. I absolutely love mine."
1,"My fianc&eacute;e ordered this ring as my wedding band. It is very nice and ""simple"".. just what I was wanting. Should note that it appears slightly different from the picture.. the edges and interior appear silver in pic, however it's gold. Arguably nicer looking than shown. Also, after trying it on a couple times over several weeks prior to the wedding I decided it was too large (my bad)... Exchange was very quick and painless."
0,Its not bad but it appears a little thicker in the image so i was a little surprised at its width/thickness. I haven't proposed yet though so lets see how it goes ;-)
1,"Gave this pendant to my assistant for Christmas. She raved about the color and unique design, and wears it often. I was just as pleased with the other Peora jewelry I purchased."
1,"I collect crosses, and many are not half as pretty as this one. It has a very antique look to it, and is very different. I am glad they put some lighter blue stones in it along with the dark blue ones. Otherwise, it would be too dark considering the metal has a dark-antique look to it. For the price, it was one of my best buys!"
1,"This is a very beautiful and high quality pendant and necklace, worth much more than the selling price. The sale price is great, there was no shipping fee, and for some reason I received a $2.60 off discount. The package came in about two business days, and in perfect condition.The gem color isn't exactly what it looks like in the picture; it's a bit lower-tone, but it is a very pretty, subtle blue, that would match well with any casual blue top. If you are looking for brighter, or more teal type of blue, I would suggest to look at the ""Swiss Cut Topaz"" which is identical and by the same company -- just search it. In conclusion, I'd like to say that I am very pleased with this necklace, and its company."
1,"this was a great purchase and I would like to order another very pleasedIt wasa great iem, great price and easy transaction"
1,I love this pretty blue butterfly. It's not too long or delicate but very feminine
1,"The product I received looks just like the pictures. I'm worried about it tarnishing, but for now it looks spectacular."
1,"Pretty necklace, definitely met my expectations. I would buy this again or give it as a gift."
1,"I was worried that a solid necklace would be annoying and somehow pinchy or too heavy to be comfortable, but I figured I'd take a chance on this because I had a gift certificate and it looked cool. It's substantial enough to not feel like it's going to break, yet light enough not to notice too much when it's on."
1,"This ring is is absolutely beautiful. The intricate lacework makes it look delicate, but it's very sturdy. As it only comes in a size 7, I like to wear the ring on my thumb and it fits perfectly. It's definitely eye-catching and I receive compliments on it all the time, certainly worth twice it's actual price."
1,"The pendant is beautiful. The description omits the measurements and when I called Pugster, they were unable to help me. I took a chance and ordered it anyhow. I'm glad that i did. Very nice quality. I took some measurements and the pearl is approx. 8-9mm with the total pendant length being 1.5cm."
1,Very Nice and is very beautiful. Love the quality and the seller is very professional in the way they conduct business. It arrived ahead of schedule and is well worth your money.
1,This ring is EXACTLY like pictured. It is VERY beautiful and makes a statement without being too bold or gaudy. The detail is amazing.
0,Good. little bit loose. i don't know if the diamonds are touching my skin on finger. The damonds should touch the skin for good results.thanks.
1,I really like those earrings. I find the size is just right. The metal is nicely polished and has the right size too. The stone is beautiful and very clearl. The blue is very pretty. They came very fast with a certificate and a pretty box. I would recommend them for sure.
1,This necklace is great for the money. The beads are well matched & the necklace is just the right length.
0,These earrings are much bigger than they appear in the photo.I am not very fond of them.
1,"These earrings are not as versatile as some I have purchased through Amazon.com, but they are noticeable and get good comments. When friends ask where I got them, they don't realize you can get such nice earrings on Amazon.com, so I've passed the word to try it. The leverbacks are my favorites, anyway, and these are very comfortable!"
0,I love the concept of this armoire. The product is cheaply made and the sliding part of the table does not work well. Better quality parts would make this item a joy to have. I am not able to use it as designed. I don't pull the table out as I'm not able to slide it back in and close the doors. It does not work as it's supposed to.
1,"After much searching, I decided to order this armoire for my sewing room as a compact storage piece and worksurface. It arrived in about 1 week and took my husband about 2-1/2 hours to assemble. All the pieces were there and the instructions were easy to follow. I've now had a chance to organize it and work at it, and I love it!The quality is what you'd expect from Sauder"
1,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PIECE! VERY NICE LOOKING ANDHAS MUCH STORAGE SPACE; THE NEAT THING ABOUT THIS ISTHAT YOU CAN CLOSE EVERYTHING UP AND ONLY SEE THENICE SHUTTER DOORS.TAKES MUCH TIME TO PUT TOGETHER BUT WORTH IT!
1,This is a really pretty necklace. So sparkly. Looks nice and sturdy. Perfect length and size of onyx beads!
0,This is definitely not a toe ring. Wore it on my thumb because it was too big for any toe. Plus all the stones fell out.
1,"I ordered the necklace for my mother. She loved it. I looks great on her. I didn't realize we were getting a chain along with the pendant, so that was just an added bonus! I would order from this company again."
1,Excellent clarity and sparkle! This is a lovely set that I enjoy wearing. The cut of the stones and the setting set off suits and more formal attire beautifully. Definitely a bargain!
1,"I bought these for my mother on Mother's Day and she loved them. They are very pretty and a decent size for the price. Just don't put the chain in jewelry cleaner!! She did and it turned a weird color but the pendent and the earrings were fine. All in all, for the price, I think it was an excellent purchase. I wish I had bought a set for myself."
0,"The earrings were a good price, but I would have preferred to pay more and get a better quality diamond. Unfortunately, buying in Canada requires additional expenses - broker fees, duty taxes etc. It would not have been worth it to return and buy better."
0,"I purchased this product through Amazon several weeks ago, and was very disappointed when it arrived. It is much lighter in color and weight than I expected. A nice necklace for a teenager but not bold enough for an adult. I have returned it for a full refund."
1,"i was sent the wrong earrings first. but when i brought this to their attention, they sent the correct pair the next dayI am very pleased"
1,"This egg/chick pendant is so well made, of good weight and fun to wear. I'm a new real chicken owner, so I thought this would reinforce my commitment to my girls!"
1,I am very happy with these earrings. They are well made and make a statement when you wear them.
0,This turned my ears green! And after wearing them only a handful of times one of the stars fell of. Not worth the purchase at all!!
0,"rather than travel to japan or the south seas, why not buy your pearls here? completely as described, black-green color was strong and size matching was good. I candled a few pearls, and the pearlescent layer was pretty good over the core.still...buying pearls online is....Not everyone is going to have the same experience."
0,"The ball is much smaller than expected. Apart from that, we are happy with the product."
0,"In the past i have ordered so many items and amazon had always exceeded my expectations.For our anniversary, thought would order jewelery from amazon as we had liked their excellent service in the past (i looked for items from amazon store only under jewelry instead of amazon affiliates due to loyalty). The time estimate for this ring said 5 days, since i had 8 days to our anniversary, decided to buy.On purchase amazon sent an e-mail that its going to take 10 days, rigthaway I decided to cancel the order (as its few days out of my required date) and send a note to the customer service and they promptly replied back with a note that its already been shipped and can't cancel it.Now i was hopeful that it might arrive on time, but worst happened, it came as previously mentioned (11 days later). This is totally wacky, how in the world it could have been shipped and it took 10 days to arrive ? Even balance bar and stuff arrives within time where as key items that were promised to be delivered in 5 days can't be delivered ? I ended up screwing the anniversary and gave so many excuses not to have a gift (to my wife because of this) - i would never buy/recommend jewelry from amazon.The story is not over, they had shipped wrong size of this ring to me, so i decided to return it. There we go, the second saga of my experience, they received it and rejected it and sent back the ring (actually they rejected it on my second ring). Unbelievable worst experience from amazon.I usually don't write reviews or feedback, am writing this so people like me can at least think twice before they buy jewelry from amazon. If you're buying any jewelry, please go to a reputed store (online i had wonderful experience with other top 2 merchants along with returns). wouldn't recommend amazon, unless you have time and energy to test these folks (not worthy risking the occasion)."
1,"I bought this for my future Husband, and he loves this ring. With my man being an eternal skeptic, I was so happy when he embraced this ring, as the ""important"" ring, to wear at all times.........."
1,beautiful blue ring and very good prices was very happy to find it thank you so much for the sale
1,I got this ring as a gift. I love it because of its unusual and beautiful design. My only comment for those who are considering buying it is that the image makes it look bigger. It's not as big or thick as it looks in the picture. Very beautiful though.
1,"After troubles with another online order, I placed this one with some hesitance. The ring looked nice in the photo, but would it hold up in real life? And, would it be shipped in a timely manner?Both concerns were answered when the ring arrived only days after the order was placed. Not only did it come in a cute gift box, it was more beautiful than in the picture. My wife loved it. It is a promise ring of sorts, after my initial proposal seventeen years ago. I told my sweetheart that this ring is a token until our twentieth anniversary, when I want to renew our vows before friends and family.Until then, this ring is a great reminder of two hearts joined as one."
1,This ring is absolutely gorgeous! The setting is unique and the ring sparkles and shines. A wonderful piece of jewelry to wear every day. I'm very satisfied with Eve's Addiction; the price is right and the delivery is very fast. I will be ordering more jewelry from this company for years to come.
1,"I have only worn them a couple times--slept in them, even-and they are very comfortable and seem to be of quality. The posts are long enough (I have bought earrings online that barely had posts!), and I think over time I will continue to be very happy with this purchase."
1,Love these earrings. They are super comfortable and just the right size. I have wore them twice so far and have gotten several compliments.
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. It was absolutely lovely. The price was right, the shipping was fast. Will definitely continue doing business with this company. My only complaint is that the chain was a little tangled when we opened it, but that was easy to fix. Very pretty piece of jewelry."
1,"Adorable little pendant. The chain was kind of cheap, so I swapped it out with a better one of my own. I've gotten several compliments on the pendant, it's very pretty and a little bit different from the norm. My favorite winter accessory now!"
1,This item is wonderful and great price on two. I gave one to my 18 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it too! Fast delivery and unique and beautiful packaging.
0,"Cute idea, but the poor quality music component realy was a disappointment. My daughter is such a fan of the 12 Dancing Princesses movie that I was sure this would be an ideal gift. She can't wind it up by herself, the music sounds cheap and off-key, and the little doll broke off the first time she touched it."
1,"This is a beautifully crafted piece, true to it's description. I found it to be an excellant value, and intend to purchase other items from this seller."
0,"I had wanted to get this for a while as a gift for a friend. she loves atlases, maps, and globes so i thought this would be perfect.it is beautiful online, but i was slightly unimpressed when i received it in the mail. it doesn't come with a chain and it is quite small. if i had to make the decision again, i think i would still buy it but ONLY because the idea of it was too perfect and there's nothing else like it out there.but other than that i would not think it is value for money."
0,This is one of those items that looks much better on picture than it is. I received an almost rusted pendant that was impossible to open (as they are advertizing). Don't waste your money!!
0,"The picture online was so beautiful. To me it reminded me of the Cat collar, ""Orion's Belt"" from the first Men In Black movie. Not that big of a MIB fan, although I was interested in a necklace look-a-like I searched online and stumbled across this pendant.When I finally got it I was severely disappointed. The cage that was supposed to ""open"" Was stuck and I broke a nail attempting to open it. It's about the size of a quarter and doesn't even come with a chain.The small hole where the chain goes through is about the size of a needle head. Most of my chains wouldn't fit and the ones that did were too delicate for this half pound paper weight.The globe itself is very beautiful but the thick fake gold gridlines running through the entire globe ruin the effect.I wasn't SEVERELY disappointed but then again I didn't think I would pay nearly $40 for something the size of a bottle cap."
0,"Although I was pleased with the overall appearance of this pendant, after opening the world cage the clip fastener refused to re-fasten properly. It cannot be worn with confidence. Too bad!"
1,"I received these earrings as a surprise Christmas gift and I couldn't be happier with them! Not only are they beautiful (I get so many compliments on them --even from guys!) they are very unique, which I love. I'm surprised at some of the reviews that say they don't like how thin and light they are --that's one of my favorite features. I have bought several pairs of earrings only to lose one almost right away because the clamps don't stay closed. Getting these on and off takes a little getting used to, but they won't fall out of your ear unnoticed! The trick is to look in the mirror and ""twist"" them in a continuous spiral motion starting at the tip of the curl. Once you get the hang of it it's super quick. I will definitely check out more of their jewelry to add to my Wish List!"
1,"I was looking for something simple, but a little different. The earspiral is perfect! I liked it so much I bought a somewhat different one in gold. Good quality."
1,"I was delighted with the quality! They are delicate, not imposing looking. My daughter-in-law will LOVE them. Thanks for the prompt delivery too!"
1,"I've had one of these for years. I also have one in 14K gold from another source.They are very well made, and draw a lot of attention due to the nature of it's design.I would love to find another gold one, but they are tough to find these days.You definitely can't beat the price for this one."
0,I bought this earing to gift it to my Sister-in-law... Its cute but it doest sparkle as shown in the picture..In the picture the stone s are very dark in color but the one i got is not as bright as i expected to be... The design is nice..
1,"Just love these earrings. They are so delicate and pretty. They are tiny but still big enough to be seen. I dont like big, heavy earrings so these are perfect for me. They are well secured so dont have to worry about losing them."
1,"These are very dainty and pretty. They are definitely pink, not red. I wear them all the time. If you like dainty things these are adorable and you can't beat them."
1,"Ruby is my birthstone. I've never had real rubies but always wanted some, so I took a chance on the one 5-star review that was already posted, as well as the bargain price. I'm so glad I did. These earrings are simply beautiful. They are tiny (be sure to check out the measurements listed), but you have to expect that for precious gems at this low price. They are still big enough to be seen and admired--I would call them a delicate size. They are subtly beautiful and perfect for my style, which is not flashy, garish, or look-at-me. As the description states, they are opaque, PINK-RED stones. The hinged lever-back clasps are sturdy and tight. I love the color--it's not quite fuchsia or magenta, but note that they are NOT PRIMARY RED. I'm using a Dell monitor, and the color is reproduced exactly on it. The center diamonds (diamond ""chips"" I believe) are minuscule but still add sparkle--the entire setting sparkles delightfully under incandescent lighting."
1,I love this earrings. It's adorable and looks beautiful on my 6yrs old daughter. It's very well secured and I don't have to worry about loosing one of them. It's not that cheesy thin wired earrings that Amazon sells at times. It's very well made. I am completely satisfied.
1,This little pair of earrings are so dainty and petite... just the way I like them.
1,"I gave this to my mom as a gift, and she said that she really liked it. My baby niece was quite attracted to it as well."
0,"When I saw the discription (RUBY), I assumed red...and the stones are actually PINK. Don't need or want pink earrings...need dark red. Also, very tiny, not worth the cost."
1,"Simple, classic style. Very lightweight and easy leverback style makes it secure. Great price for 18k gold jewelry. I have purchased this product two times."
1,I bought these ear rings as an exchange for a book I received as a gift. Much prefere these ear rings and really enjoy wearing them. They are light and dangly and easy to wear.Very happy I bought them.
1,These earrings are lovely. I bought them for my mother and I know she will love them also. Excellent price for the product.
1,"They are smaller than the picture makes them appear, but otherwise are identical.I gave these to my sister, who is a picky person when it comes to basically everything. She loved them. They are quite unique and look ery nice. A different look for people who like studs."
1,"This pendant is good looking and came just as advertised. It would have been nice of the company to have put each of the seven pedants, which I bought at same time, in separate gift boxes rather that shipping all seven in the same gift box. They must have thought I was going to give them all to the same person."
1,"I thought the product was highly accurate compared to the Anime. Although the Anime showed that Uryu had a cross bracelet and not a necklace, the cross piece of the product is good."
1,"I used this in an Uryu Ishida costume for my 11 year old son. It's a beautiful piece that looks just like Uryu's cross in the anime.The chain and clasp are nice and sturdy. Both held up to a lot of fidgeting and fiddling with. The only slight apprehension I have about the necklace is that it's made out of metal, but I'm not sure what kind or whether there's any lead content in it. A few years back, there was an issue with imported jewelry, so just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't let a child or teenager wear this against their skin for extended periods of time. Aside from that caution, this is wonderful and worth every penny."
1,It was a great buy. my wife LOVED them. Showed up on time and was what I asked for. thanks again
1,"Very pretty, clean/clear and well-made;look just like the picture. Perfect size for my ears and show up really well. I am very pleased with these earrings! (The faceting is of the ""square within a square within a square"" type."
1,These earrings are very sparkly and beautiful! Very well worth the money.....I was completely impressed by how nice they are!
1,I LOVE these earrings. They are really pretty and go with several outfits. They are so delicate and elegant looking!
1,"I ordered this ring and another exactly like it in another stone color. Both came in a shiny little box. One was heart shaped and the other was a traditional square box. Both had tiny matching bows on top too. It was cute already and I had not even opened the box. I was very happy when I opened them. The stones are beautiful and the Celtic design on each side is well defiined yet delicate. Excellent presentation, beautiful sterling silver ring, and a reasonable price. Could not ask for more."
1,"I love this ring. I have purchased more than one item of jewlery from Amazon and love. I will be purchasing more in the future, weather it be for me or as a gift."
1,"I wear this ring almost every day. I get compliments all the time. They can't believe how much I paid for it, so I have stopped telling them."
1,This was a very pretty ring with a nice amethyst. The celtic design matches my wedding ring very well.
1,"I love this ring, I've bought several recently and this one is my favorite. The design and detail is beautiful and it's very well-crafted, the sterling silver is nicely polished. Incredible price for the quality and value of this ring!"
1,so i got this ring for my other good friend and she loved the color. its perfect for teenage girls.
1,"This Celtic knot ring with the amethyst CZ marquise is just as beautiful as the photo. I was really pleased with this ring when it arrived, it was exactly as I expected."
1,of the 3 pair I Bought these seem to be the ones I wear th emost. Really love them. They arrived in the stated pkg. in brand new condition.
1,"For the money, this is a great ring. My husband loves it."
0,the ring is beautiful and i've received tons of compliments for it but the gold wore off very quickly. i've only had it for 2 months and half of the gold is gone.
1,"I bought these as a suggestion from a friend. It ended up being an excellent idea. They look very good, they fit my style and they are unique. I wear them a lot, cause they are comfortable to put on and off and also to style. I get lots of compliments for them. I already have them for more than 8 months and they seem fairly sturdy. Once note though, need care when handling as the wire that holds them together can get a little worn and the earrings can look a little lopsided, so once in a while need to be re-shaped them by hand (easy to do). Overall, beautiful earrings!"
1,I love the silver jewelry I bought. It was better than I could ever imagine.
0,"This wrap bracelet was not as expected. It is unique, kind of pretty and sytlish but i did not like the quality once it was received and I would not wear it.."
0,"The collar stays are what they are, collar stays. They work fine.The reason I chose these over other ones an amazon was so I could have a nice way of storing them (I keep losing the plastic ones that come with shirts).Imagine my disappointment when I open the box, and the first thing to come out is a shard of broken glass.The metal stays were shipped inside the bottle, which was inside a small cardboard box, which was inside a larger box with thicker cardboard. There wasn't any padding or anything, so I'm not surprised the bottle was broken."
1,"Not sure why people say these fit really tight--I wear pretty standard mid-range clothing (Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, etc.), and they fit normally. On one shirt, they're actually too small. But regardless, nice, sturdy, effective collar stays. Just make sure to take them out before dry cleaning!"
1,"I purchased these collar stays for my husband. He's an accountant, and has to wear dress shirts almost daily. His biggest pet peeve is not having a neat collar. These things work great. You simply insert them into the small pocket in your collar. It stays crisp and neat all day. I'm sure I will be a lifetime buyer."
1,"It can be difficult to find collar stays, especially the non-plastic variety. These were shipped quickly and packaged very well. They came in their own pouch and were individually wrapped. The stays work very well. The metal variety works much better than the ones made of plastic. It will keep the collar down without a problem. Highly recommended."
1,"I am more than pleased with this silver Medusa pendant. For various reasons I am attached to Medusa and the ideas she represents about strong, misunderstood, and misrepresented women, so I was very happy to find this on Amazon. It looks much better in person; the photo doesn't do it justice. The chain is silver and a good length--not too short--as sometimes occurs with an accompanying chain."
1,"I loved this beautiful, simple, yet complex anklet. It was a gift that almost did not get given because everyone who saw it, inducing myself wanted it. My friend was pleased to get it after hearing the story of how it almost was not!"
0,Tough synthetic leather of very bad quality. Looks very cheap. The only pro is that it fits for 100-euro banknote. And does not fit for US dollars at all!
1,"I just received these earrings and they are very pretty. The 1/2 carat for each ear is a really nice size, and the color of the stones is wonderful, sort of an ocean/island blue, deeper than swiss and lighter than london blue topaz. The color in the photo is almost right if you can imagine adding a hint of yellow or green to the blue, causing it to look a little more medium aquamarine or, again, like ocean/island water. The faceting is nice and the earrings show good sparkle and allow light to come through, without diminishing the color. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,"The quality of these earrings is absolutely amazing! They were a little bit bigger than I thought they would be, but they are very lightweight, so they don't drag down on your earlobes. The gemstone color is exquisite, and although they are a bit larger than the average stud, they fit with casual wear."
1,"This picture does not do justice. This item is bold and elegant, and fine quality. I recommend it as a gift, or treat yourself. Fast delivery, and a real find at his price."
1,My wife was so excited when she saw the ring...it truly is a quality ring.We will definitely look to purchase more jewelry from your site.
1,I love this ring because of it's size and boldness. I love chunky jewelry that doesn't look cheap. This ring is goth-light and not overbearing. I would love to see more rings like this one on amazon.
0,"cheaply made, falls apart regularly. very pretty tho. maybe i could take it fully apart and use the beads and cross on something a little better than the low quality wire that breaks often."
1,"I purchased this pendant & chain for my sister, for Christmas...she collects angels. I wanted to send her something special for Christmas, and this cameo was perfect! It even came with a little ""sack"" which had a cord to tighten the top...much like a minature version of Santa's!She loved it...great price and quality! Thank you!"
0,"The angel is a glued on piece of plastic that looks horrible. The silver pendant itself looks poorly made with minimal detail (looks like a bad soldering job). The chain is very flimsy and the clasp is extremely small (not easy to use for anyone with adult sized hands). I will be returning this immediately, sad because it was supposed to be a birthday gift I bought because it looked nice in the picture. I now know why the picture was low quality and you couldn't zoom in! I was tricked!"
1,"this was a beautiful pendant i bought it for my mother and she loves it. this item is just like it looks in the picture, it is made with quality materials and would be a great addition to any womens woredrobe."
1,"I usually don't write reviews, but these earrings deserve one. I gasped when I took them out of their package and tried them on. They're perfect--not too big, not too small, and they'll match the necklace I was looking for them to match perfectly. Great pair, and the price is fantastic. Don't skip on this pair of earrings! You'll be sorry if you do."
0,Fun piece to wear out to a club or party. For $4 how could I go wrong taking a chance? Not too cheap looking. Wood beads and chain.sweet.
1,"I LOVE these earrings! They look just like the photo. They are a perfect size and a really unique color, plus I like the box-shaped setting. Great purchase!"
1,"Def. a great bang for the buck, i picked up a few of these because they are suprisingly hard to find in a size 4. but the quality was great along with size and shape"
0,"I ordered a ring that stated ""Toe Ring"" in the description. The ring came very quickly but was not a toe ring. I don't know anyone with a size 8 toe. If you know anyone please direct them to this seller! Is it a wedding band, toe ring or thumb ring? Pick one!"
1,I am happy with this product. I was looking for a cheap ring to test my ring finger size. This ring did the trick. I would buy this product again.
1,"The ring is perfect if you don't want anything too big or overbearing on your finger. I ordered the size 3 to use for a cute little pinky ring and it suits the use nicely.However, it's not as nicely polished as I'd hoped, but it will do fine."
1,"Love this ring. perfect fit, perfect size. will highly recommend to anyone looking for inexpensive, yet stylish band. cudos to the customer who recommended getting one size larger. try it. you will like it."
1,"It's cold here in the Northeast, and that makes my fingers shrink. So, my wedding ring has been flying off and landing in unfortunate places (under the couch, in the washing machine, in my baby's diaper!). So I ordered this ring in 4 sizes so I could use it to hold my ring on no matter how small my finger shrinks. It's PERFECT! Great customer service and shipping too. It left LA on Friday and arrived in NY on Monday via USPS! Great service, great ring, great price."
1,I bought two of these rings to put on either side of a solitare ring. They look great!
1,This was better than I thought it would look. I wear it as a toe ring and fits fabulously!
0,"The ring is like used, has a rayon and beaten in one side. Money wasted! I did not like it!"
1,this shipped quick and was exactly as described. It was purchased to help keep another ring in place on my finger and it works great! sturdy hasn't bent yet and its been a month of constant wear
1,"Ordered on the 7th,came on the 10th. Amazing service. Product is better than i imagined. Its a great buy! Band is as thick as my 4mm so i wont worry."
1,I love this little thin band. I wear it on my thumb and it is thin enough that it doesn't bother me while I am working. Silver is my favorite colour when it comes to jewlery and this little ring shines and silver is so easy to take care of. I love it!Sterling Silver 2 mm 1/16 in. Thin Wedding Band / Toe Ring / Thumb Ring size 8
0,"Beautiful ring setting, but didn't like the stones, particularly the blue one. It was too flat on top and looked like plastic. Too bad, because the setting is first class. Hated to send it back, but couldn't live with the stone."
0,"I got this necklace for my brother because he's really good at chess, and I thought he'd like it. But he ended up saying that it wasn't the universal sign for a king."
1,"I added these to my wish list this year while browsing through earrings.. I can't say enough how glad I was to have received them as a gift. They look even more delicate and elegant in person. I have received countless compliments on them, and cannot believe the reasonable cost on these earrings. I haven't gotten such unique and affordable silver jewelry in the US ever! At this price these are the kind of earrings I would have expected to get while traveling in places like Guatemala, Thailand, Indonesia, or Honduras."
1,"i like it. This earrings are lovely, small and delicate. I recommend this product 100%. are perfect for all occasions"
1,This is a beautiful necklace. The silversmith work is superb. It is very unique and a nice addition to any jewelry collection. NOVICA does an excellent job of communicating status of the order. The packaging is very nice as well. You can sense the pride they take in their profession.
1,"I gave these lovely earrings to my daughter this past Christmas, and she loved them. They sparkle beautifully in the light, and their color goes well with many of her clothing choices. I would purchase these earrings again.SCER007 Pink And Clear Genuine Genuine Swarovski Crystals Cluster Sterling Silver Leverback 1"" Dangle Earrings"
1,I love the clear crystals and low profile of this earrings. Seller shipped the item very quickly.
1,These earrings are gorgeous and look exactly as they are described and pictured! I would buy more of them. Also got the blue lavender ones.
1,"I absolutely love Gem Avenue!!!! Every time I buy jewelry from them, I am always amazed at the quality of the pieces. I love these pink and clear Swarovski earrings very much!!! They are cheery and brighten up any outfit of mine. They sparkle immensely!!!! I am never disappointed with this company!! :)"
1,Just the right size of pink sparkle around your face. Got the pendant to match. Love them both.
1,"I was searching for a combination white/yellow gold bracelet in addition to one I currently possess. I was lucky enough to come across this bracelet while surfing the Amazon.com website. The bracelet arrived yesterday and I was, to say the least, very impressed. It is beautifully crafted and looks wonderful on my wrist. I happen to have a small wrist for a man and men's bracelets of this size are not too common.I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for a high quality, gorgeous gold combination piece of jewelry."
1,"These earrings are light in weight and dangle nicely from comfortable and secure leverbacks. The colors are pure and when the light catches them they almost twinkle. I am most satisfied with the earrings and the company that shipped them in two days. They came in a sturdy, pretty and giftable box. They are winners in my book! {also come in a variety of colors}"
1,"I bought these for my 12 y/o daughter. I was afraid they would be too long. They are the perfect size. They feel and look like they are sturdy and well made. Take them out in the sun and they sparkle. These are stocking stuffers for Chistmas. I know I will get a big hug and a ""Thank you Santa"" on 12/25/09."
1,Bought these on a whim to match a blue sweater I like to wear. I've had SOOO many compliments on these earrings. They have flash & sparkle but not gawdy. Can wear them with several outfits. They are very nice & price was reasonable.
1,"These earrings are lovely, they have a great sparkle to them, especially in the sunlight.They made a wonderful Christmas present for my friend. She likes them very much."
0,"Like many of the other customer reviews, I agree that the ""crystals"" are not much more than plastic. The picture is also misleading because the beads look like they are dangling off the earrings, free to move around. However, this is not the case; the beads are completely stationary and do not move at all. The only way they could move is if you manually turn/twist the beads around the single post that goes through them.Although the beads and the aesthetic design are lacking, the lever-back metal quality is very good. Putting the earrings on is simple, and the lever is very secure and strong. I don't feel as if the lever-back mechanism will break or wear down anytime soon. It is also designed so that it would be very difficult to lose the beads or separate the dangling part from the earring. It is great for me because I wear out my earrings pretty easily, and these earrings feel very strong and secure--not easy to break or fall apart. In the end, I feel that it is barely worth the sale price, but definitely would not be worth the full price."
1,The item came in a bag in a nice box. Packaging was nice as this was given as a gift. They were really pretty and sparkly despite some of the negative comments on the item and my friend absolutely loved them! I almost didn't want to give them to her and might have to order myself a pair =) They are nice to dress up or dress down. Great buy!
1,"The complete set---earrings, necklace, pendant---go very well with everything you want to wear. I'm glad I did buy the set."
1,"i thought these were pretty in the photo, but when I got them I thought they were beautiful.... I love them..."
1,"I got this for my coworker for her birthday, and she loved it. I have bought those earrings before for a gift, and my friend was happy with it, so I thought it will work for my coworker; she loved it! It is shiny and feels comfortable to the ear. I saw that there is the bracelet online, too. Maybe I can buy that for my coworker for Christmas and make it a set for her. I will recommend those earrings for every day use, but they also work well for going out, too!"
1,Made well. Great crystals and different tones. Looks more expensive than they are. She was happy to receive them. Buy it!
1,I couldn't be happier with these earrings. They are as lovely as pictured. I have received so many compliments on them and people ask me where I got them. I have purchased several items from Gem Avenue - the prices are very reasonable and I have never been disappointed. I highly recommend these earrings for yourself or as a gift.
1,These earings are very pretty and not heavy on the ears. They realy sparkle when they are in the sunlight and they go great with the braclet.
1,I gave a pair of these earrings to a friend for Christmas and they were a great hit. She simply bubbled with joy when she opened them.
1,"Good product, looks nice and I gave it away as a Christmas gift so I can't say how it performed."
1,I love these earrings. I got these and they are easy to put on and take off and they stay in well and the lever doesn't pinch my ear. I got many compliments on them. Great buy. Would totally recommend.
1,"Lovely, lightweight earrings that catch the light and sparkle nicely. Can't go wrong for the price."
1,Earrings really sparkle. Love them Will dress up any outfit. True quality
1,"Bought these with the matching bracelet for my bridesmaids, and I was thrilled when I saw them. Perfect, sparking, beautiful!"
1,These earrings are really pretty. I was not interested in spending a lot of money and these look much more expensive than they were. I ordered three diffeent colors. I get a lot of compliments when I wear them.
1,I think these earrings are reallygreat. The color and sparkle arejust the thing for anything youwear.
1,These earrings are beautiful. The colors of purple and blue are SO pretty together. I will wear these earrings at least once a week.
1,"These earrings are gorgeous and are exactly as described. I bought them as a Christmas gift and wanted to keep them myself. My cousin, the recipient, loved them."
1,I originally ordered the clear style of these earrings and loved them so much I then ordered the lavender ones and the multi-colored ones. I love all of them and get so many compliments when I wear them. They sparkle and are lovely.
0,"They are much smaller than the picture depicted, but I will save and use for a birthday gift in Fwbruary."
0,"The earrings arrived quickly and the quality is nice. However, the colors are very faint which is very disappointing. I'm glad the price was low otherwise I would return them."
0,I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE MY ITEM. SO I COULDN'T POSSIBLY RATE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE. EXCEPT TO SAY THAT ITS TAKEN WAY TOO LONG TO RECEIVE.
1,"I was so pleased to receive my earrings and find that they were as beautiful as they looked online. In addition, they weren't 1/4th the size that they appeared as so often happens when you by on the internet. I will use this company over and over."
1,"I love the sparkle of these earrings. They reflect any color that is nearby so is constantly changing. More importantly, they never clash with what you are wearing. I love the clasp backs and the price. A perfect gift. Amy"
1,"I have been looking for lever-back dangle earrings for my black outfits and I am so happy I came across these and ordered them. When the sun or light catch them, the earrings glisten so much. Perfect pair of earrings. You can't gp wrong with them!"
1,I wore these with a nice black dress and they looked great. I agree with the other reviewers that they look high quality for the price.
1,"This is just beautiful!!!! very shiny and very sparkly!!! If anyone is on the fence about it, I say to get it!!! You won't be disappointed !!!! It's not too big....just the right size, perfect for everyday use!! and the delivery was very quick!!!"
1,"I have both the black-and-clear version and the blue-and-lavender version, and I love them both. The weight and length are nice for everyday wear, and even with long hair they have a nice ""flash."" My mother talked into giving her my first pair of black-and-clear ones, so I just ordered a second pair. I love lever backs, which are getting harder to find."
1,"I bought these for my wife because we agreed to not buy each other gifts this year so that we could save money for our home downpayment. I wanted to get her something that was nice, but inexpensive anyways (and break our agreement). I liked these because they matched a black & white diamond necklace I bought for her a few years back. At the price I didn't expect much, but hoped they would at least be presentable. I was pleasantly surprised. The quality is excellent. Though obviously not to the standard of a true swarovski piece or other fine jewelry, it holds it own very well and is among her favorite costume pieces. I had to show her what I paid for it to prove I didn't splurge. She thought they were worth much more than what I paid."
1,I really love the look of these earrings! I was trying to match a necklace and they turned out to be perfect! Another advantage is the Leverbacks since I don't like hooks that get caught in my hair. The Black and Clear Swarovski Crystals are beautiful and the earrings have a very dressy look without being too long for me.
1,These are beautiful and sparkling - the picture doesn't really capture how pretty they are. I love them!
1,The earrings are beautiful. I have received compliments every time I wear them and the matching necklace. I love the way they sparkle.
1,Very pretty earrings. They sparkle nicely in the light. I love that they match almost anything that I wear.
1,It was a gift for my sister and she loved them. They were exactly as shown in the pic.The ear rings were neatly packed and it was ensured that they don't get damaged in transit.
1,Second pair of these I bought for my girlfriends went with the black because its a nice neutral color and she loved it. Wearings with her neutral colored clothing and looks great. She loved them. Recommend.
1,"These earrings arrived yesterday, nicely packaged and right on time. They look pretty much like the image, but of course, the cyrstals are much more sparkly. This is a wonderful addition to my earring collection; they can be worn dress up or dress down."
1,I bought these as a gift for my wife from her amazon wish list. Could not have been easier or more economical and they were just what she wanted. They go nicely with a necklace I purchased on Amazon before.
1,"I love it. The service was great right from the start.I love the e-mails that tell me where the shipment is, and when I can expect it.The product is just as beautiful as it was on the site.I am very, very happy!"
1,"Sterling Silver Marcasite Cross Pendant, 20""I Love it! I have been looking for a long time for this exact one and found it. I had been given one just like it on my 16th birthday by my first love and lost it. This is exactly like the one I lost. I am so happy."
0,"It kept falling off, I loved it so much I just kept it, now I lost it on vacation in Las Vegas and I am very very upset. Its gone now forever, I feel as if I left my heart in Vegas now. Thats probably why they stopped making it!Janine in NY"
1,"I really like my gold cross. I am going to wear it to church this sunday. I feel protected when I wear it! It's perfectly sized. It's smaller than usual, but that 's the way I like it. Very fine and delicate. I am happy with it, as I lost my confirmation cross many years ago at my grandparent's farm. This is perfect."
0,"Bought it for an adult. Cross is too small but the necklace was worth keeping even for $30. Necklace is gold filled, not gold plated and that is a big plus. The color is a perfect match for 14K and it should be since it is gold filled. Great length for a cross or pendant and it is a pretty chain. I needed something strong that isn't going to break and lose a real 14k cross but didn't want to pay a fortune for a chain. This was so much better than any 14k gold chain I was looking for and again for $30 it was better to keep the chain and use it for the cross I already have now. This cross is too small, I will give it to my little girl and put it on a small chain she already has. So giving it a three stars for the great necklace."
0,"Charm looks much better in the picture, of course I understand that it's much smaller in person. The quality is not that great, unlike the description. I've seen much better in the stores!! I will not return it because the shipping will cost me more than the charm is worth. Too bad for me, I've learned my lesson! Thanks anyway - my fault!"
0,"I liked the appearance of the pendent, however the the chime was more of a rattle. I had ordered the larger one also, and enjoy the mellow chiming sound."
1,The sterling Silver Harmony Ball Pendant with snake chain arrived today. The shipment was very fast as I only ordered it 1 week ago. It is very pretty and the chain is very nice. It looks very expensive and the chime is perfect. I am very pleased with the product and will order from Sabrina again
1,"And so does my daughter. She got these for Christmas, and they are stunning! Excellent purchase, and I'm thinking about getting me a pair of my own."
1,"I ordered these as a gift for an 11-year-old girl who is not permitted to wear large earrings. Though they're not blue (the blue hue in the picture is most likely the result of iridescence; the cubes are clear, traditional crystal) they're cute. They do measure an inch in length; however, this is outstretched from the tip of the post to the finishing bead beneath the cube. The dangling portion--cube and all--is 5/8 inches, and the cube itself is a little under 1/4 of an inch; the metal rings are the remaining 3/8. They're very dainty, very pretty, and at a very reasonable price. Would recommend."
1,"I bought these for my brother-in-law for Christmas. When I received them I was very pleased with the quality of the product, as well as the packaging of the item. I know he will like these."
1,I love my snake chain. I wear it 6 days out of the week. It was the lowest price online - even cheaper than ebay!!! I received it quickly as well. I highly recommend this seller. Great product at an excellent price! I will shop again!
1,"These are absolutely gorgeous! Bought them to color complement one of my outfits, but on its own it is very attractive. It looks better real than on the display. Can't wait to use them."
0,"always on time, efficient and as advertised. they are very small chips, but appropriate for the price. have used them many times for pieces to incorporate in my jewlery"
1,"The earrings are very elegant and the absence of a visible hinge is wonderful. There are, however, minor discrepancies with them that, though they did not affect me, might be an issue for others.Things to take into account with these earrings before you purchase them:The hidden hinge is placed a little low so if you have small lobes or your hole is less than 3-4mm below your the top of your lobe, the top of the earring will come up above it. They fit perfectly for me, but every ear and piercing is different. MOST people will not have a problem with this, though.The post is not the typical rounded post wire. It is a rigid bar with a slightly larger size than post wires. Freshly pierced ears that have not stretched out a little may find this to be a tight fit at first, but it passes.Otherwise they are absolutely beautiful. Wonderful earrings."
0,"I had these earrings on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are light-weight and comfortable, but I was disappointed to find that the front of the hoop tends to tilt forward, exposing the hinge and part of the post. The post is fairly long, 11 mm from the hinge to the catch, compared with 8 mm on another pair of hoops that I like better. These earrings might be better for someone with thick earlobes."
0,"These were nice earings, which I received as a gift off my wish list. But after I wore them about 3 or 4 times, one of them fell out and is now lost. The post does not stay in place very well. I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an ""innovative clasp"" which avoids lost earings. But they did not work well for me.By the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain. They sent me another pair right away at no charge. This suggests to me that others have complained in the past. I appreciate that they were so responive."
1,this was well packed and came in a box with a tiny bag and inside the earrings. they are beautiful =) love it. =)
1,this is a grad. gift for our daughter and I'm sure she will love them THANKS
0,I looked forward to receiving these earrings in the post and wasn't disappointed until I tried them on! They never stayed in place at all they kept tilting forward exposing the post and hinge.
1,I love this necklace especially the price. It is so deceiving to look at on the screen. It is beautiful.It shimmers! i should have bought one for each one of my daughters!
1,Great necklace. It's an eye catcher. Fits well for average build guys. Might seem a bit small for well built blokes. It's been subjected to a lot of wear and tear and it's as it is. Total value for money.
1,"I love these earrings! I actually purchased these to replace ones that I finally lost after ten years. However I was disappointed with Amazon as I found them $50 dollars cheaper at pagoda.com which is a mall piercing place and they have an online site as well. The ones on Pagoda are exactly the same, so I called Amazon to see if they would price match but they wont so I'll be returning them!"
1,"I love these earrings. They're quite small, but they never catch on anything, and add a bit of polish to whatever you're wearing."
1,I love the earrings. The hoops are small enough to wear to work and large enough to be noticed.
1,"These are exactly what I wanted. I had some reservations about size based on other reviews, but these are exactly as pictured with the measurements you provided.They are extremely classy and more substantial than I thought they would be. I bought them to replace some really cheap ones that lost their shine.I will definitely be wearing these 24/7. Very comfortable. Nice packaging for a gift."
0,I am less than happy about the earrings as they are not as presented on the site.I was seeking earrings that are 0.75 to 1 inch in diameter. These rings were presented as being .75 inch in diameter but when we opened the package - the rings were less than about .5 inch in diameter. Oh well.
1,"These earrings are stunning. I've worn them day and night which I could never do with any other earring this size. They look great, feel good and are more than worth the price I paid. I have diamonds, pearls and other precious stone earrings and these are a great addition to my jewelry collection. I will be buying more Duragold jewelry."
1,I absolutely love these earrings. They are just what I wanted. I had some like them but had lost them so I was so pleased when I saw these on Amazon. I liked them so much I ordered some for Mom for Mother's Day. She loves them too.
1,My wife loves these. Exactly what she wanted and it made a great valentine's day gift. I am glad I got it.
1,"I have been looking all over the internet to find a small gold hoop earrings, I saw these and read the reviews, some of the reviews stated that they were real small, so I kept looking around, but I kept coming back to this pair, so I decided to give them a try, besides if I did't like them I could always send them back,. I ordered them, and they were shipped in less than a week, and when I recieved them, exactlly what I was hoping for.I love them, as some of the other reviews stated. they are comfortable to wear day in, day out. Perfect for everyday wear. they are about 1/8 in diameter small than a dime, (they are not a huggie earrings) but has a nice thickness to them about 1/4&#34;. As I mention before a PERFECT everyday earring. If you are looking for a everyday pair of small earrings, these at it."
1,"I may not be the best judge of jewelry, but my wife liked them very much as a Christmas gift (and she is forthright enough to let me know if she didn't). They are elegant in their simplicity, and very lightweight. Although they are the perfect size for my wife, they are probably smaller than you would expect, so I would suggest checking the size carefully before ordering. The clasp secures the rod tightly so I doubt they would be likely to fall off."
1,"These little earrings were exactly what I wanted for work (to wear with scrubs and not look gaudy). They are small, but have a nice width, so they are very shiny. I also like the snap-bar closure. They'd make a nice gift for a pre-teen as they are simple but elegant and the snap bar closure makes them easy to put in with little chance of loss."
1,"I ordered these earrings for my Mom and when I saw them I thought wow, they are pretty small but on the ear they look great. A really nice choice for a simple but great quality pair of earrings."
1,"If you scan some of the reviews about these earrings you'd think a magnifying glass should come with every pair so you could find them. Nothing could be further from the truth. They're smaller than, say, a wedding band but there's nothing flimsy or insubstantial about these lovely gold hoops.One reviewer said she loved that she could sleep in them quite comfortably, so I tried it for myself and found out that she was right. That's handy for me when I'm traveling because I'd really rather not take off my jewelry and risk losing it in the confusion of rushing from place to place.I don't recall anyone mentioning the finish, but it is exceptionally attractive and shows no sign of losing its luster after weeks of wear in all sorts of conditions. Beautiful earrings at a beautiful price."
0,"These earrings sit unworn on my wife's dresser because they're uncomfortable to wear. Apparently the pin that fits through her earlobe is flat, which stretches out the hole."
0,These earrings are very very small. They are also difficult to open and close. Not nearly worth the $75 price tag. These are more suitable for a child or young teenager that likes small earrings.
1,"I bought these as everyday earrings for wife. She loves them, and I am impressed with quality. Excellent AMAZON price 50.00 makes this a nice deal."
1,These are very nice earrings. My wife loves them! They look very nice on her and she wears them a lot.
1,"I bought this for my wife for Valentines Day and she was elated. I also got the white gold earrings. She said they were the perfect size and weight. When she's happy, I'm happy."
1,Love love love them! Quality is unbelievable. Everything about them is absolutely perfect. I recommend them to anyone looking for a great hoop.
1,"The description clearly states that the earrings have an inside diamater of about 25mm. For metric-phobic Americans, that translates to about 1 inch. They're also about 2mm thick, which is about 1/12th of an inch.Just because a prior reviewer couldn't do the conversion is no reason not to buy these earrings!"
1,"These earrings are exactly what I have been looking for. They are substantial, gorgeous and a great size. The ""lock"" is tight and secure. I am beyond thrilled!"
1,This pair is my second-- lost an earring and had to have another pair-- they are my go-to hoops- comfortable and good looking.
1,"Gorgeous earrings. Nice, smooth finish, high gloss, wonderful feel, not cheap or flimsy feeling in any way, like some I have purchased. Nice size, too, worth every penny. They are light enough to feel comfortable to wear and solid enough to look and feel costly. I'm very happy with them. A+"
1,"I have been looking for an affordable pair of gold hoop earrings in a 2 inch size, and these are all I could ask for in a pair. I got them during a Gold Box sale at an awesome price for the pair. They feel really lightweight on, and fit right in with other jewelry I wear.As others have mentioned, treating them more like eternity hoops works better for the clasps. The only risk of doing it the other way is loosening the grip the post goes into. Very lightweight feeling on, but also very substantial (not as thin as I had expected). These are hollow gold.I definitely recommend them. If you are going for a stylish pop at the office or for going out and about, these earrings are great! It is easy to put them on, take them off, and they feel great on. For the size, again, just not too heavy on the earlobes."
1,"I have been trying to find the perfect size, quality and weight earrings for months- and I have found them! These hoops are sexy for night time and still professional enough for the office. I could not be more pleased. I wear them all the time and they are GORGEOUS. Worth the money!"
1,"My husband purchased these for my birthday in December, and I really love them. They are light weight, thin,they stay closed and they are not too big. If you are in the market for a lovely pair of hoop earrings. These are absolutely perfect."
1,"These really are lovely! perfect size to peek out under hair, or to be dramatic with hair up. The clasp is tiny, but just don't force it and it opens/ closes easy enough. Advice on hallow hoop earring my husband told me after talking to a bunch of sales people and then buying these online...use only one hand to open close, b/c if you use two, you can easily twist the tube of the earring and it will never look the same after it gets tweaked. Enjoy!"
0,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled since Duragold has generally good ratings. The earrings were super flimsy to start with. I also had problems with the earrings falling off, the clasp is just a bad design. After less than a year one of the clasps actually broke in half while I was wearing it. It did not get caught on anything, I was just walking and it fell off. Funny how Duragold brags about durability on their website but mentions nothing about warranty. I contacted Amazon customer service so we'll see if they stand behind their product....."
1,These earrings are a great size & really wear well! I have sensitive ears & have problems with nickel & these do not bother my ears whatsoever. Highly recommend them for the price!!
1,"Just received the earrings and I think the service, the conditions and the quality of the product is amazing.Now I have one excellent present to give during christmas"
1,"These earrings are about the size of a dime, JUST what I wanted. They are a good quality product and you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend!"
1,Small gold hoops...that is exactly what she asked me to get her for Christmas. I opened up the box to check them out and they are very nice. I think these are exactly what she is looking for. She should be happy on Christmas morning! Perfect product description. They are a little over 1/2 inch in diameter just as stated.
1,"Thea're really beautiful and comfortable. The only thing is they look bigger at the picture than they're in real, but even if I knew it I would have ordered them as they 're really great."
1,"This review is for the Duragold 14K white gold hoop earrings 0.59""diameter. I received them today and they are beautiful, perfect size, in great condition, very well made, and good weight. They were easy to put in although the clasp is tricky to get open and then hooked back in but I would rather have that than the earrings falling out and being lost. Very happy with this purchase. They could not have been better!"
1,LOVELY FIT GREAT LOOKS GREAT WOULD BUY MORE IF HAD TIME AND SOMEONE TO GIVE THIEM TOO WOULD BUY MORE
0,I got these earring for someone for Christmas and one has already broke. (just fell out of the ear) For $65 you would think you would get more value for the money.
1,"Excellent quality, beautifully packaged. They were exactly as described and just what I was looking for."
1,First of all the describtion of these little beauties is accurate 11mm is just barely over over 1cm. In addition there is nothing that states that the picture is the actual size so how can it be misleading? Reading would certainly help those that complained.I ordered the hoops today after seeing them on my girlfriend. Simple and beautiful in 14 not just 10k I just have to have them. With the price of gold at an all time high for $29.99 these earrings are a steal. Another outstanding value thank you Amazon.com.
1,I got these as a Christmas gift from a special friend and absolutely loved them. Small enough to wear at night to bed and stylish enough to wear every day and forget about them. Classy without being too understated. Sadly I lost an earring last month. I knew they were purchased by my friend on Amazon. It took shipping and returning two other pairs. But FINALLY I found my earrings again. Thanks for your quick return policy and helping me find the right pair. I am one happy girl now!!! :-)
1,"I love these hoops. They are small, which is what I wanted, and I can use them every day. After reading some of the negative reviews, I hesitated to order them. However, I figured I could always send them back if I did not like them. Needless to say, they are NOT going back!"
0,These earring are not gold!!! They were gold colored when I first got them but the color has faded to silver. I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend them to anyone.
1,I wanted small gold earrings. I found small gold earrings. I like them. They've held up well. No complaints.
1,These earrings are 1.5cm = .59in the perfect size for being physically active and continuous wear. I'm so happy with them! The closure is very secure and they are so shiny. They are small yet substantial and that is exactly what I was looking for. Everything I found in department and jewelry stores was much more expensive and much less quality. Also the pair I received were Made in USA and that thrills me to no end! Thanks Amazon.com :O)
0,"I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW SMALL THESE ARE. THEY LOOK MUCH BIGGER IN THE PICTURE, AND ARE THE SIZE OF A DIME. I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED IF I KNEW. I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND THESE WILL GET LOST IN IT. SHOULD SHOW ACTUAL SIZE PICTURES. MUCH TOO SMALL FOR ME, WOULD WORK GOOD FOR A CHILD HOWEVER."
0,"i bought this a couple of months ago for my daughter's birthday. A few of days ago she came home from school with one of them broken. When I asked her what happened she told me that she had taken them out of her ears. When she put them back in, the latch on one of the earrings fell off. What upset me the most was when I went on to Amazon to return the item that cost $65 and broke a couple of months after purchase,it said i had missed the deadline for returning it. All in all i do not recommend buying this product."
0,This is a very small hoop earing. I thought it would be larger - perhaps it is just me. The price goes along with is tiny size.
0,"These earrings were ok; I liked the way they looked. When I wore them I received compliments and was questioned about where did I get them? I had no problems with the earrings; I wanted to order more for birthday gifts. I hadn't worn the earrings for awhile and when I went to get them I saw that the color had tarnished, so I threw them out."
0,"Very disappointed in the size for the money - considering the size, the price for these earrings just does not correspond.I paid $40 earrings for what was supposed to be a major discount. I believe i could have gotten these earrings somewhere else for $20.They look nice and seem to be well made, but barely sit on the top of my pinky much less on my pinky. More for toddlers and very young children."
1,"replacement pair of earrings for my daughter; more robust attachment than most others which fail after months of wearing. It's a very common simple style but the quality is higher than most; no allergic reaction to the materials in the 14k alloy & she's pretty sensitive. Price-wise it's not a super bargain value, but reasonable as it's higher quality."
1,"These earrings are a nice size for a little, everyday hoop. They come nicely packaged in a blue velvet gift box - a nice present to myself. The weight seems good - they're bigger than they look on the web site. I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,"i have to admit i was disappointed in the small size of these earrings when i first got them. i really think that amazon should provide pictures on a model and other size references as it's hard to judge online. i was expecting about the size of a dime, well these are significantly smaller than a dime and about a dime's width. but i have been wearing these everyday since i got them, i have not taken them off. they are super comfortable, i don't even remember i'm wearing them, and i have very sensitive skin and can only wear gold earrings. they have a nice shine to them. they are very good quality. the clasp is very secure. the price is very good considering the price of gold these days. i could not find anything similar for the price in my local stores. i also appreciate that they are made in the usa."
1,"These are sturdy gold hoops. Although thicker than the standard gold hoop, they do not bend out of shape like the thinner ones do."
1,I bought these for my wife and she wears them all the time - they are nice looking and she says she does not know they are even there as they are very comfortable to wear.
1,I have trouble with some metals causing infections even though my ears were pierced many years ago. These earrings are perfect and are even comfortable to wear when sleeping.
1,"They are small, but that is what I wanted... they are great!!! Got them very fast!!! Was able to wear them for Christmas!!"
1,"I just got these the other day, and they're even more beautiful than I expected! I like smaller hoops, and these were the exact right size for me. Very shiny, lovely yellow gold shade (not brassy), and the closures are nice and secure. If you're looking for a lovely pair of small hoops, these are the ones for you! The price was very reasonable, and shipping was fast.... I'm very happy with this purchase!"
1,"These earrings were just what I was looking for - small and simple . They are great for every day wear. I think they are a good buy, considering the price of gold these days."
0,Can anyone post a picture of themselves wearing these earrings?It's hard to tell just how big they are without the visual perspective.Thanks everyone
1,"The earrings are very nice, good quality, the size is correct, I buy for a gift and I am proud to buy this earrings"
1,"I am happy with my purchase. They were a little smaller than I expected, but they work out just find in my 2nd ear hole. I put them in when I received them and have never taken them out (over a month now)."
1,"These earrings are an excellent purchase for the money. This was my first jewelry purchase over the internet, and I was very pleased. A very nice presentation box was included with detailed care information as well as return information. This gift was an excellent purchase and was combined with the 14k Yellow Gold Hoop Earring w/ 1 Mirrored Ball (which is a smaller hoop). This has an excellent effect for those who prefer to wear two earrings on each ear!"
0,"You get what you pay for. It is very cheap, simple, and weak. It is exactly like the picture. To each there own."
1,I own a Duragold bracelet that I wear everyday for 12 years now and absolutely love. I also took advantage of the lifetime warranty to get it repaired this year and I had no problem. The earrings are light and just what I wanted for everyday wear. THey don't come off at bedtime. There is no need. I wish they were not so expensive but that is what you pay for a product as fine as Duragold.
1,"just the right size for casual or work. look great,have thoroughly enjoyed!! will purchase white gold as well.terrific buy!!!!not too long or too short. would look great with short or long hair."
1,"Cute earrings great size for late night outing or work! Just what I've been looking for very, very, pleased!"
1,"These are nice quality basic hoops. Fastening is secure and I must say I listen for the small click. They are an excellent size; seems like they are made to be of a slimmer tubing, but overall a fair size so they can be seen through long or short hair. They are light and comfortable to wear, and the gold is classy. Every earring person needs hoops and these will certainly get a lot of wear."
1,"I got these for my Mom as a Christmas gift. In her words they were,&#34;The perfect size&#34;. When I told her there was a lifetime warranty and they were solid gold, she was ecstatic!"
1,"These small stud gold ear rings are a necessity for me because my pierce seals shut even if left alone for a few days. I'm very particular about what ones I buy and I've owned more pairs than I care to remember. These from Amazon are so perfect; I can sleep on them, they don't irritate my skin. Besides they look elegant even if just to go to the grocery store!!"
1,"I had been shopping around for some white gold ball studs for some time when I came across these. I have very sensitive ears (I can't even wear sterling silver) so I was looking for a quality product. I had read all the reviews and was concerned with the complaints of the posts being too short and the product being made cheaply. I have had these in my ears for about a month straight. I have left them in for showers, exercising several days each week, and sleep. They have not fallen out and they still look amazing as they did when they first arrived. I will say that when they arrive, be CAREFUL when removing the tag from the backing of the earring. I tugged a little too hard and bent the backing, but it was easily bent back into place. One could say that this is a defect, but it's gold, it's small, and it's fragile; just be careful! I would suggest cutting the tag off with scissors instead of pulling it off. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and I love these earrings."
0,The earrings are pretty and what i expected for size(small) but the earnuts are thin and come apart easily. Tried taking the tag off the earnut and the curly q on the back of the nut unraveled. If you purchase you will need another pair of earnuts.
0,"These are pretty earrings and seem to be good quality, but the ball is so tiny you can barely see it. Perhaps is they were shown with another object for comparison."
0,I had these studs for only 12 hours! The earring backs that came with them were so awful one of my earrings came out and was lost before I even realized it was gone. :(
0,These earrings arrived quickly and are a good size. They are not too big - I am using them for my second hole. The backs on them are a little loose and bend really easily which makes me a bit scared about losing them. I have been wearing them for a few days and they have been ok so far. Overall the earrings are nice but the cheap backs make them only get 4/5 stars from me.UPDATE
1,What can you say about gold ball earrings? The size is right. They are quality. It is exactly what I was looking for.
1,If they had showed a side view I would not have ordered them. They looked like a earring I was looking for not the ball. T he earings I was looking for were a half ball.
1,My daughter love this and it looks really nice when she wears it. Love this and a great buy from Amazon!
1,"14k Yellow Gold Round Filigree Pendant, 18""This pendant is 1"" of sparkling grace. If you want to make a statement without being overbearing this is the pendant that can do the job. For the price this pendant is very elegant. Because it is two-toned it will go well with any piece of jewelry that you want to put it with. Give it a try you'll love it!"
1,These beautiful pierced earrings are just what I wanted. They are exactly as described and even have a slightly larger back which makes them easier to put on and holds the earrings more securely than the usual tiny backs.
1,Very happy with the earrings. Price was great and I love getting shipping free.
1,"I purchased these Duragold 14k Yellow Gold stud earrings for my daughter. They are exquisite, just as described and illustrated. I am very pleased with this purchase."
0,"picture makes the stud appear to have a diamond shape, but it's just a round ball earring. It's just okay."
1,this is a christmas gift for my daughter. thank you for the great item for the wonderful christmas item for her
0,"I was so happy with these earings until I wore them. The backs provided did not lock. I tried them on once, and the backs simply fell off. i managed to save both earings, and tried to find some ohter backings that would hold the earings in. Unfortuantely, this did not work, and the second time I wore them , I lost an earing. Perhaps the posts themselves were somehow wrong? I don't know."
1,These ball earrings are great for my second set of ear piercings. They are just the right side and they are not obnoxious to wear to the office.
0,"I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo. They felt quite flimsy when I got them. I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one. The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like. One has already come off. They are however very pretty. The quality was just not what I expected."
0,"I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star."
1,"Awesome, I love it...very pretty and heavier than I expected."
0,3 STAR SINCE BEADS DO NOT STAY IN PERFEC ALIGNMENT LIEK IN PICTURE. The tiny metal that holds them on hoop moves so they bunch up.
1,"I initially purchased the 16 inch length of this necklace to wear with a white gold & yellow gold diamond pendant. I looked everywhere for a STURDY two tone chain with no luck. All I found was tinsel strength wisps of gold chains which I did not want. As the gram weight in this piece was perfect as a substantial chain for my pendant, I took a chance and it did not disappoint me. I loved it so much, I bought the 18 inch necklace and matching bracelet as well. I have received many compliments because of it being so different and unique."
0,"I agree...they are very dark and cloudy. Also, one of the earring's back just slides right off. They were really small too. I guess they might be worth the price...too bad I bought them when they were $99."
1,"These are exactly like the picture shows and are sturdy and simple - exactly what I was looking for. The clasp on one earring was a little tight fitting, but it loosened up after a few open and close motions -- I'd rather it be too tight than too loose and risk having the earring fall out.They are a great size - not too big and flashy, but as I said simple and clean. I wear them all the time now -- really pleased with them!"
1,The weight of these are perfect and the clasps feel very secure. Nothing like the classic white gold hoop earrings.
1,"This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary, and I've just had nose surgery. Like other reviewers, I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings. I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible, and these seemed to be a good deal at $24.99 when regular price was $75. Just since March 16, though, both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $34.99 and $70. It's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal, but not onerously so; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear, and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side. The earrings are larger than I expected for the price, which is good, but they are not too big. Nickel size is about right, and they feel as if they have some weight to them."
1,"Beautiful, shiny, sturdy and well constructed, and are thicker and look more solid than I expected. I'm very pleased."
1,"The item I received is shaped more straight than pictured above. I was able to gently bend the wires so it'll fit my wrist better.It is beautiful and 'different'. It fits my wrist very well, and I am 5'2"", 110 lbs, and normally wear size 2 clothes. I do believe though, it'll fit someone up to size 8 or so as the wires are flexible. Hope this will give you a better idea of its size."
1,Just received my earrings and they are beautiful!! So worth the money!! I did my research and this was by-far the BEST quality and price!! Highly recommend these earrings!
1,"Love these hoops so far. I had other pairs(not this brand) that have just broken and fallen off...so I am happy with these. They are 14k gold(the only type of earrings that don't cause my ears to break out), but they are also affordable. Nicely made and very comfortable."
1,"These are really unique sterling silver earrings. They are a longer length earring, which is what I was looking for. Very pleased."
1,I've purchased about 5 of these type rings from Silver Insanity. I have not been disappointed with any of them. I'm not positive but I believe they're designed to be worn on the thumb. I prefer to wear them on my ring finger where they are impressively displayed. I have received several positive comments on each that I've worn and am happy to recommend this company and these rings to anyone looking for something nice to wear.
1,When I wear this ring (usually everyday) I get so many compliments!! You cannot find a ring like this for under $20 anywhere but here. Arrival was very fast too. This was actually a Christmas present for a friend and let's just say she got something different after I tried it on!!!
1,"I really, really like this ring. It's easy on the eyes, was easy on the wallet, made of sterling silver, and best of all it comes in a wide array of sizes. I am a full figured gal, and have been looking for a ring for my left index finger at a size 13/14 for some time. Not too much luck there, unless I wanted some ugly costume jewelry or man's ring... Took a chance on this - and love it. I originally had a size 13 in my cart, but based on another review - I opted for one size up and ordered the 14. I am glad I did as the 13 would have been a little tight for me.Some of the reviews said the ring thickness is too ""thin"". In my opinion, it is just right. This is an extremely wide band and if it was any thicker - the ring would not be comfortable to wear. It is simply perfect as it is. If they had different designs in this type of ring - I'd buy 'em all. Wish the seller offered these rings in the bigger sizes with stones in them - I'd buy those too!Can't beat this ring for 30 bucks, and combine that with lightning speed shipping and you have a winner. I ordered Wednesday night from NY and it arrived Saturday morning from Arkansas."
0,"Unless your piercings are stretched from wearing heavy earrings, you may find these wide, flat posts too thick to pass through your ear lobes! One of my lobes had a pierced hole too small, although I have no problem wearing other earrings and studs. With my other ear, the earring post went through with no problem, however, it was heavy enough to give the hole a slit look. The earrings were well made, felt solid, not hollow and the price was good, but, they were not designed for me and were returned."
0,"I received the earrings rather quickly, however they were definitely smaller than I had thought. I like them, however the product description said they were 1 inch in diameter, I'm not so sure, they look much smaller. Anyway I wear them, so it wasn't a complete waste."
1,"Perfect; just the earrings I was seeking - worth every penny. Beautiful white gold, the diameter of a US quarter. High quality packaging make these suitable for a gift. I have no trouble whatsoever with putting them into my small piercings. Very, very smart looking, suitable for work and play."
0,"worth the money,was a christmas gift for my daughtersmaller than i thoughtlook good on my daughter and will buy again,i have nothing but a positive attitude about themthanks amazon"
1,These hoops are perfect for any occasion! I am currently enduring chemotherapy and have lost all of my hair. These hoops are the perfect accessory with my bandana-doo!
1,"My gf loves them and it looks great on her, hopefully the binding wont break like some other reviewer comments, worth the money!"
1,"very nice quality. these were sturdier and heavier than I'd anticipated, an excellent surprise. I'd recommend them highly. Great value"
0,"These earrings feel like plastic,,there is no 14k stamp anywhere. I really feel like I have been ripped off, for the first time on Amazon and I have been a customer for many years..I will be returning these earrings, do not buy them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"
1,I purchased these for my wife as a birthday present. Its been three days and I think she still has them on. What more do I need to say...
1,"I always worry that what is shown in a picture doesn't truly represent the item. This is especially true of jewelry, since pictures make things look so much bigger. Several times I've purchased jewelry based on a picture, only to receive a tiny piece that nearly requires a microscope to see. I'm happy to say that these earrings are exactly as pictured. The gold is thick and the crossover style is truly elegant. The earrings are lovely and they will make a very nice gift."
1,My mother loved this and was a great birthday gift. These look even better in person and go great with anything.
1,I love this earing. I wear it almost everyday. You can wear it to work or just casual. Very and easy to the ears.
1,"I ordered for my wife, and she loves it. I got lot's of hugs and kisses. Great company very fast shipping, and very professional."
1,"Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well. For the price of just under $200, these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher. They are of a fair size and look heavier than they are. They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch. They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here. Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set! I just don't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings."
1,"I bought this for my granddaughter and am truly delighted. I have never dealt with a better company than Discoveries. They bent over backwards to insure prompt delivery and they could not have been nicer. The quality is teriffic, the price is fair, the shipping is prompt and the customer service was excellent. What more could you ask for?"
0,"it was beautiful when I received . but when I wear first day it broken , that was very dispointed."
1,this small but beautiful storage or whatever is really nice and we got other stuff from the same place that are also incredible :-)
1,"Duragold 14k White Gold Solid Perfectina Chain Necklace (1.0mm), 16&#34; came quickly and the wike loved it. Very dainty, highly reccommend."
1,"This one is not that long so you can see the pendulum (or however you call that thing (a little gold cross I gave her for xmass)), but the chain which came with it broke. this was a replacement. it is solid, and great, would recommend you get it for you girl too!!!"
1,"This is a beautiful chain- clasp is reasonable for the size of the chain. Needed a 14kt chain for a pendant received as a christmas gift, and this is perfect. Not for very large pendants, but it is solid gold and very pretty."
1,"I spent a lot of time (both online and in stores) searching for a good deal on a white gold chain and couldnt touch one for under $160 on sale in a store. I decided to take a chance in ordering one from Amazon and am VERY happy I did. The chain is of good quality, very sparkly (like diamonds) and beautiful. It is perfect for a small pendant or to wear by itself. I would definatley recommend this necklace to everyone.. :)"
1,"A delicate chain and very pretty. The cut and finish on the chain really sparkles making it appear thicker. Bought for my daughter in law as a gift to go with a small dark purple amethyst set in 14K gold pendant.The combination was quite stunning and everyone in the room immediately noticed the sparkle to the chain. While I did not weigh the chain I could care less if it is lighter than advertised. The markup on new gold jewelry is so high that anyone looking for investment value should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a delicate, high quality, lightweight 14K gold chain for under $100.00 and backed by Amazon's incredible service then this is for you."
0,"I bought this item expecting it was white gold, as it appeared to be in the picture. However, it is yellow gold, which I do not wear. I will try to regift this."
1,"I ordered these cufflinks for the Monsignor of our church. I notice that at mass he always has on these beautiful white shirts, and cufflinks, so I thought that would make the perfect gift. I ordered them at ""Cuff Daddy"" through Amazon. They reached me in 4 days and the quality was beautiful. I was very proud to present them to him. I would definitely reccomend them and I would definitely use them in the future. Keep up the good work Amazon.Onyx and Mother of Pearl Hexagonal Cufflinks Set in Silver with Gift Box"
1,Great gift. The person I gave them to wears cuff links everyday. He loved them. It was the perfect gift.
1,"I have done business with then before on ebay. There charms are always readable, some of the others are not."
1,"Yes, the necklace is a bit on the small/delicate side. However, when you consider the novelty aspect of this necklace, you dont want it to seem too childish - which would come across if the necklace were any bigger/thicker. The chain is beautiful, as is the actual pendant. When people notice the necklace, they get the humor right away. But you dont want it to become a distraction to everyone on the street/office. I think the size is perfect."
0,"I wound up returning this item the same day it arrived. I was buying it for myself because it looked so cute. Yeah it is - if you're about 14 years old. It is way too small for an adult. The detail is nice, but good luck seeing any diamonds unless you're planning on also wearing a jeweler's glass along with it."
1,"This item is very pretty and got a lot of laughs, I think because it fit her personality so well. It has a very thin chain but seems tough enough."
0,"The pendant is smaller than you'd think, but it is nice. The only problem I have is that one of the holes to run the chain through is too small for anything to go through it. My heart hangs at an angle as a result. I could return it and request a replacement, but it's not really worth doing that."
1,"These earrings are beautiful! The green and pink gold of the leaves shows off beautifully against the yellow gold of the earrings circle and ear hook. They are just the perfect size - large enough to attract looks from admirers and small enough to look really classy! The seller, Rich Peel enterprises was great to work with. And the product shipped instantly. A real nice piece for anyone's collection."
1,This swarovski cluster earrings are very beautiful. I like them for formal wear because they are dainty looking and can go well with a similar necklace without being 'too-much'. They are also suitable for the 'executive look'.
1,This charm is sturdy and beautifully detailed. It is NOT one of those hollow or cheaply stamped out charms. We are very pleased with this purchase. You can hang it on a necklace chain or charm bracelet. It is just beautiful. We gave it as a gift to commerate a birthday cruise and my sister loved it.
0,"As mentioned by others, my wife saw this exact item in a large jewelery retail store and fell in love. However, before we could get back to actually buy it, they stopped carrying the item and she was quite disappointed. So, I was thoroughly thrilled to find it here at Amazon and ordered one up for Christmas. As expected, she was thrilled and loved it, right up to the point when the stone fell out of the setting. Amazon will not send a replacement so I guess I'll have to return it and see about finding a replacement ....."
1,"This is a quality piece of work, and I love showing it off to my friends. I sort of consider it my little good luck charm. The only problem about this ring is that you can't reach down into your pockets or wash your hands with it on, because it'll snag your clothing (or anything around it) and fall off when your hands are wet.Despite this flaw (it was expected), it's a wonderful piece of jewelry for any dragon lover."
1,Its even nicer than it looks in the picture! Great buy!Get one for your very own gorgeous devil! She will love it
1,this high quality sterling 2 part semi bangle is just gorgeous with brilliant stones!!I highly suggest you buy this one for your peace loving friends or yourself!
1,"Without leaving home, I got exactly what I wanted and it was promptly delivered right to my mailbox."
1,"I was hesitant to purchase silver on-line but my fears were gone when I received this beautiful 30"" sterling chain. I wear it every day and it is just a shining as the day I got it."
1,The rope chain looks like the image. Good looking and strong. The 2mm diameter size is the right choice to work with the Washington Quarter holder.
1,I love this chain so much I have worn it probably at 2 dozen times since I bought. I usually wear it with my 22 and 24 inch chains. thanks brenda mckenzie
1,received my necklace quickly and it is beautiful. Packaged well and perfect.
1,"I don't know all specs of the science behind the Q-link, however, I know that my people have worn copper on their bodies, dating back thousands of years. There must be something to it. I haven't had an allergy attack lasting more than a few hours at most, in the last year and a half since I bought the Q-link! I can concentrate better and indeed perform better at certain tasks."
1,I work at a radio station and I'm surrounded by computers and electronic equipment. I was experiencing headaches after work every day. I was sceptical about the product at first. My allergist tested my biofield with and without the q-link. There was a major improvement while wearing the q-link. This is a must-have for anyone who works in front of a computer. I no longer have headaches after five hours at my radio station!
0,"Tried the product for 90 days, felt no difference. Asked to return bracelet, company rep talked me into to trying it for 30 more days. Still no diffrence. Sent bracelet back almost 2 months ago and still no credit. Always the usual answer. Credit will be issued shortly. I would stay away from Q-Link."
1,"although a bit heavy for daily wear, this necklace has a powerful feeling when worn. the low price and high value make this purchase an A+++"
0,Gave as a gift to my fiance for Christmas. Its costume jewelry so I didnt expect much. She liked it but it took them a while to ship. Almost 3 weeks delivery.
1,"I just got this pendant in the mail, today! They say it's a protective pendant, and I feel that's what it is! When I opened the package, I instantly felt this warm, powerful feeling coming from it! It's really awesome!!!"
1,"Because of the good reviews I read, I decidedto chance it and purchase this pendant.I just received my Silver Pagan Wiccan ProtectionKnot Pendant a few days ago. The picture doesn'tdo it justice. It is beautiful.I, too, like it because it is so different.It arrived well packaged and well protectedand there wasn't a long wait to receive it.I have it on a 24"" sterling silver chain.If you enjoy things that are different,I recommend this pendant."
1,"I loved the Wiccan Protection knot pendant, I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't taked it off since. She had wanted a Celtic tricetta necklace, but absolutely adored this one just as much.Thank you"
1,"I ordered this for my friend who is Wiccan, and when i recieved it, i didnt want to give it away. It is so beautiful and shiny, and i got it quickly. I don't think the picture gives this as much credit as it deserves. It is very beautiful.. a little pointy at the corner parts, but magnificent. She wears it every day!! :)"
1,I bought this for my daughter's 18th birthday. It's perfect...a little smaller than I thought it would be but beautiful...She loves it...
0,"After looking online, this product looked deep blue, pretty large and I was excited to buy this for my fiance. But I received it in the mail and I was somewhat disappointed. The color is a lot lighter than expected and it's tiny. I believe she will still like it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want a larger size."
1,Very nice item...my wife loved it.Excellent price and the quality seems quite good. The black pearls contrasted with the white and the double stranded necklace is quite striking.
0,"The pendant was a gift for a friend. My friend was very pleased and appreciative. Although, I like the pendant I thought from the image that it would be large. But considering the fact that it was sterling silver I was happy.Thank you,Carol Hartnett"
0,"If you're looking for high quality that's durable, anti-tarnish and giftable--something worth passing on to loved ones as a family heirloom, perhaps-- keep looking. I would not give this as a gift, as I'm not real confident it will hold up for too very long, but for myself, it'll suffice--for now. At least one compartment arrived slightly but visibly warped, another, rather difficult to open. The necklace hooks are rather skimpish and more suitable for smaller pieces--not much good for '06 styles which are more generous in size. I'm not disappointed because I didn't expect a whole lot for $45 so at least I won't be crushed if anything happens to this on my trips, which is what I'll reserve this for--although, it doesn't hold quite as much as I expected, certainly not adequate room for my earrings. Overall, it is a fair and attractive piece and worth the $45 I paid, but not a cent more. (I've seen it go for more is why I'm saying)"
0,"This baptism bracelet was a sad disappointment for me. I know that it came from a vendor other than Amazon, however, the picture depicted is not what I received. The bracelet was not attached to the lovely note card as shown, which I dearly wanted as a keepsake. Also, the bracelet itself is actually sized for a baby. Not a girl. Very disappointed. Will be returning it."
1,"I bought these for a girlfriend for her birthday, and they were/are nice quality. The gift box was a little different-looking, and very pretty for a gift presentation. They are a good size, but not too large, and the green jade color was excellent. They were so green, in fact, that I thought they might be treated or dyed in some way. I especially like that they are a simple, non-traditional jade piece, not asian-looking, with dragons or symbols. My friend likes them a lot too, and thinks I have good taste!"
1,"I have no complaints the cross is nice and was what I was looking for. Also, I recieved it in only 3 days and it wasn't expected for another 5 days!!!!!!!!"
1,I just love this pendant. I bought it to match earrings and a ring that I already owned. The picture on the website is exactly the way it looks and it is very beautiful. Great price! This is a just the right size and weight. I would have paid more if it came with a chain.I am very happy that I have this.
0,"For those casual dabblers in wiccan/kabbalistic talismans, I suppose this product is good for costumes. But for those that place an importance on authenticity or the meaning, purpose, and power of words, This product has a 'fatal' flaw. Even though the letters circumscribing the pentagram are a latin transliteration of the hebrew word for Yahweh (YHWH) - It should be ""TeTRAgrammaton"" and not ""TeTRAIgrammaton"". That's like getting your girlfriends name (let's say Rebecca) tattooed on your arm spelled ""Rebekah"". The meaning is different if mispelled (especially to Rebecca, who will probably break up with you). So consider this before purchasing."
0,"I must say...I am really bummed out about this necklace. When I got it in the mail, it came in a nice box and looked beautiful. Very cool for a Buddhist. It is substantial, nice and heavy. You could tell it was not cheaply made. However, I have had it now for a month, and I am now very upset by it. It has not turned my skin green, but it surely has changed colors itself. It has gotten all dark and dirty-looking in color. And the chain has oxidized too; it is like a dirty bronze color. If I could upload a picture of what it looks like now, I would. I have cleaned it thoroughly in liquid tarnish cleaner twice in the past month, which only seemed to help about 70% each time, but it has quickly gotten all tarnished again. I am really bummed out. I loved this when it first arrived; now I am a bit embarrassed to wear it. Even though we Buddhists are supposed to accept that everything will grow old, sick and die, and that we should probably apply this acceptance to inanimate objects as well, I'm still bummed out."
0,"The talisman is o.k. The photo is much shinier and colorful than the real thing. It actually looks brown and dull in real life, without much color variation. I purchased it as a gift and think it will hang as an ornament vs. being worn as a necklace"
0,"My husband, neighbor and myself spent the entire night trying to solve the puzzle and couldn't and tarnished what was a beautiful ring when it arrived. We cannot solve the puzzle so it was a waste of money."
1,"For those of you having difficulty with the ring..I think you forgot it's supposed to be a PUZZLE.if it were easy, what fun would that be!- great ring, I love it..it was a fun challenge :)"
1,"This ring is gorgeous and incredibly frustrating until you finally figure it out. Another reviewer left written instructions for how to solve the puzzle, but I found those to be impossible to follow. So once I got it I decided to make a video for anyone too frustrated with the ring. It is available on youtube ... [...]"
1,I love the design of the ring. I wear my ring practically everyday. When the puzzle ring came apart I did have some difficulty getting it back together. I emailed the seller and within a day they emailed me the instrustions with pictures. I'm sure all of you who've spent hours trying to put your ring together feel pretty silly now. Now that I know how to get my ring back together it takes only a few minutes. I would recommend this item to anyone... just remember to email and get the instructions.
1,These are very pretty earrings. Just right and not too heavy. The moonstones are beautiful and the peridots are very nice accents. A good choice.
1,Very nice. I like the peridot addition to add a little extra detail. Given as a gift. The receiver was very happy with the earrings.
0,It was nice and in good shape. Not as large as I felt it should have been according to the picture advertised. The chain was a very thin and I would say cheapened the product. The delivery was prompt and I suppose I got what I paid for.
1,"Bought this ring about two weeks ago and love it. It looks just like the picture, shiny silver and the turguoise is pretty. Great for everyday wear."
1,"Great length, perfect weight and style for any pendant. Doesn't knot and fits right over your head. Bought one for my mother and myself."
0,"I bought this for a friend and already she is noticing how the coating of the ring is falling off, losing its bright silver coating. very poorly made"
1,"I just got this necklace today and the beauty exceeds my expectations. The stones are lovey, the chain is high quality, and it is set perfectly. It is a gift for my mom, if it wasn't intended for my mom for mother's day I would be wearing it myself."
1,"i purchased this chain to match a sterling silver cross i bought, i was plesantly suprised, the chain was very good quality and matched perfectlyi would highly recomend this store for quality and service."
1,"I bought this resplendent, silver chain as a late Christmas present for my girlfriend. She opened it and hasn't taken it off since. A classic piece of jewelry for any girl's collection, this gleaming necklace is an A+."
1,"They're really gorgeous. They aren't as white, white as pictured but for the price I wouldn't really expect them to be. If I hadn't come back to write this review I wouldn't have noticed that."
1,"I used my dad's acount to make my purchase, and I am so pleased with the chain. It looks wonderful, expensive, and my baby will LOVE it."
1,I received the amethyst studs quite soon after ordering and they are a nice deep purple...good quality. i am enjoying them!
1,"I'm always looking for nice stud earrings. Besides, garnets are one of my favorite stones. I love their special shade of red that makes them very pleasing to the eye. These dainty earrings are very lovely and well made. They are very comfortable to wear too. I could have gotten the larger ones but 5mm are perfect for when I want to dress up my ears without feeling like I'm overdoing it. They are simple yet they shine beautifully. I got these earrings when they were on sale for $19.99 and if I see them on sale again, I'll probably buy another pair to give away next Christmas."
1,"These earrings were a gift for my mother. They arrived in a small ziploc bag, which was placed inside of a velvet bag, which was placed in a small gift box. The studs are small and simple, as expected from the description, but they are bright. Although the posts are 14k gold, my mother had no problem with them being too soft. Great purchase, highly recommended."
1,"I am so happy with the look, feel and size of the peridot. I recommend this to all. Excellent price, excellent quality. Beautiful!"
1,"A jeweler in Hawaii went on and on about them. Similar stuff in his display case cost 3 times as much.Although prices for these have been rising, still a very good deal. My lady loved them.Update"
1,"As some of the other reviewers have said, these earrings are a very pretty color and very sparkly. Can be worn with anything-not too dressy, but dressy enough!"
0,These earrings are pretty but quite small - appropriate for a young child. I expected more for the price. Packaging for presentation was quite cheap.
0,I was really disappointed with these earrings. The flat surface on the earrings are different sizes so they don't look right when you wear them. One area is large and the other one is small. The color is nice. I am probably going to return them.
0,I wore these earrings for one day and the back was so loose on the earring that it was lost. I would not recommend this product.
0,"The color of these earrings was gorgeous and they were quite sparkly. However, they were NOT 6mm in diameter, and they were different sizes. They were each closer to 5mm, but one was larger than the other. Needless to say, I have sent them back."
1,My 18 year old niece loved them. They're her birthstone. They have a nice shine to them and have a nice weight to them.
0,"the prong is soo thin. its ok i dont really like it, i wont recommend it to others tho,,,it look cheap also..."
0,"These bracelets were pretty online, and pretty in their box, but the clasps are cheap and every single one broke on the first or second use. They were a gift and by the time I found that out it was beyond too late to try and return them. Save your money, admire the pictures and spend your dollars on something else."
0,"Don't order from this company! The picture here, as you can clearly see, is that of a brooch. Order it, and guess what shows up"
0,"The pin itself appears to be in pretty good condition for a cheap price. However, the pin is Made in China. I thought it was Made in USA because the company is in Colorado, but I was wrong and I am not happy about it."
1,ANIMAL BLACK WHITE CAT ITALIAN CHARM looks exactly like my cat Tippy. I Love it!!
0,"I purchased this for my wife, she seems to be happy with it but I am disappointed. The Silver looks like its plastic and the jade isnt far off. I am not a jewlery expert so maybe I am wrong but I dont like it."
0,"I ended up returning the item, a necklace which I believed could hae been purchased for half what I paid at the local Target.Return policy was good however."
0,It is pretty but not for me. It didn't do anything for me when I put it on. I returned it.
1,This ring is absolutely beautiful. The stone is big enough to be noticed yet not so big that it is gaudy. Very classic and elegant. It is just what I have been looking for!
1,Was so happy when this came in. It matches the earrings I ordered. I like the emerald cut very much.
0,There are no measurements in the description and I thought this was going to be a longer necklace. It's more like a choker than the long one I was hoping it would be. But still very pretty. Please add the measurements Amazon.
0,"The advertisement is deceiving. One line states between 6-7mm, and another states 5.5-7mm. The stones are definately a 5.5. or smaller. That is no problem as long as you are expecting that. I was hoping for some larger pearls and did not get them. The color and brillance are pretty though as long as you have a magnifying glass!"
0,"If you don't expect round pearls and don't care that your pearls have these icky looking threads running around the middle of it, then these will do if you want pearl and peridot earrings. I like the color and really debated whether to return them or not because of the crappy pearl, but hey hopefully no one will be fascinated by the lovely color contrast and want to get a closer look. I'm never buying another pearl jewelry from Amazon because of these pearl earrings though."
0,I love the look of this Mjolnir pendant and wore it everyday for over a year. However I had the pendant on a metal chain and over time the chain ate away at the pewter loop on the back of the pendent until it eventually broke off. So now I'm in the market for a new pendant. If you've got to have this particular one I would recommend using a cord necklace instead of a metal chain.
1,"I recently purchased a ring from Amazon. By far this was the most satisfied purchase I have made in years. The quality was great, outstanding looks and everyone freaks when I tell them how much I paid. The ring looks like $400 - $500. Very satisfied."
0,This is a very pretty ring but my hands are rather small. It looked like costume jewelry on my hands so I returned the ring.
1,Love it! This ring is really pretty and I get a lot of complements on it. You will really like it too!
0,"I really don't feel it was worth it to buy it. It's tiny, looks of poor quality and has turned a portion of my finger black. Hence which makes me doubt its worth."
1,"I ordered this for my girlfriend as a last minute, little something extra for Christmas, it arrived in 2 days without paying extra shipping, and it was so pretty, it was my girlfriend's favorite of all the gifts I gave her.It came with an 18"" chain but I think it should be 22"" or 24"" , my girlfriend just switched chains and wears it everyday."
1,"I love this necklace, I wear it everyday and it still looks as great as when i bought it. It 's a great quality and it was very affortable."
1,I ordered this pendent for my boyfriend because his fav color is blue and I am the star and he is the moon.
0,"I was a little dissapointed about the colour of the stone,it's much lighter than the picture,but they look nice and are wearable"
1,"I like this piece, it's large, well made and eye catching. People notice it when I wear it and ask what it is. The opals sparkle, and I like it a lot. It's not too heavy but I think it's best on a long chain, not a choker around your neck. I have it on a 30"" square chain."
0,"I thought this was beautiful so I ordered it. I didn't read the specifications, so when it arrived I said, ""That's IT?!"" It was too small!! It was a better size for earrings. The picture is very misleading. Too bad it's so small it's beautiful but I'm returning it because it will look ridiculous. Someone will have to be in your face to get a good look at it!"
1,"Nice, heavy and not to big watch. More like jewelry than a wristwatch, sparkling diamonds, and glowing gold. Wouldnt wear it for a swim, though."
1,"This was a gift. My mother-in- law loved it..Perfect fit for an 8 inch wrist. Shipping was quick.Packaging was damaged upon receipt, but bracelet was fine."
1,"I lived in Belgium for many years and have since returned to the USA. I was looking for something as a reminder of the country I grew to love so very much. This charm is absolutely beautifully crafted and I am extremely pleased with it. I wear it on a chain as a necklace however some may prefer to place it on a bracelet. It is the perfect size to do either, actually. I highly recommend this Seller to others. Thank you!!!!"
0,"The necklace was nice, but when I got it, there were signs of wear, and rust, looked like ""used"" to me, so I returned it. The chains tend to mingle up in one another."
1,I bought this for my five year old daughter and it was the perfect length. It's secure and really cute.
0,"The diamonds on this ring were way too small...I got a similar ring at Zales for the same amount, and the diamonds were larger and more brilliant."
1,"I love this ring. Its exactly like my $1,000 engagement ring that I lost. I wear it all the time and it keeps its shimmer and shine. A very believable ring. Not too big."
1,"This wood bead bangle is very beautiful, earthy and eclectic. I recommend it highly. Shipping from the vendor was very fast and item arrived a week before projected date. This was an excellent transaction."
1,"It was a little smaller that I thought it would be. But over all, it brought an amazing smile to my girlfriend. She loved it and has been wairing it since"
1,"I assumed it was smaller than it looks, but it's Beautiful. And looks perfectly around my mothers neck. fast services too.awesome gift"
1,This is a very well done little starfish! I bought it after our school district gave each employee a small starfish with the little story about making a difference for each one the person rescued from the low tide. I've gotten several compliments when I've worn it.
1,"This is a great charm for a gold chain! The charm looks just as pictured and the quality is good, so I'm very pleased with my purchase."
1,"Shiny substantial piece. Nice size, not a tiny charm like those for charm bracelets. Just as pictured."
1,"With the nice screw backs, these beauties may actually remain in my daughter's ears. A number of her earrings (non-bug) have had a tendencyto ""fly away,"" never to be found again...usually due to the ""slide"" backs,I think. A father, I don't know exactly how to describe this stuff, bearwith me. I was hesitant, but the price & prior experiences with Amazongave me the courage to buy these. Now I wish I'd bought four pair, esp.since I see the price is, um, a bit higher than my pair. Oh, well...Icould not be happier with my purchase! Come in a nice bag, box &, allin all, a quite purty gift. M. Swofford"
1,Looked forever for something like this - wear it all the time with solitaire pendant.
1,"This chain is beautiful, appears delicate and feminine, yet is incredibly sturdy. I'm not easy on any jewelery products and this chain has held strong."
1,"I have two of these anklets. I liked the first one so much that I ordered the second to have as a spare/back-up. My ankle measures 8 1/2"" and I ordered the 9"" anklet. It fits perfectly! I wear it 24/7 and never take it off. Every once in a while it seems to be a little tarnished (from body lotion, I believe) and all it takes is a quick swipe with a silver polishing cloth and voila ... as pretty as new! If you are looking for an anklet that you can wear all the time this is the anklet for you. It is very smooth and doesn't catch on clothing. I am very pleased with my purchase of this anklet!"
1,I finally return it because it was too long for me but since i really like it i bought the same style but shorter one. It is really cute
1,"This is a great anklet. Love the longer length, you don't even know it's there. Very comfortable. It also has a easy to work clasp. Over all excellent buy!!"
1,"Very good buy. Delivery was super fast, even over busy Christmas period. Photo is very good reflection of actual product. Beautiful, quality piece. Worth every sent."
1,"This was a gift for my daughter. She has a very high quality zodiac pendant in 18k gold. The chain was perfect. I had a very similar design to the rim of the pendant, so it looked like it was made for it."
1,"The shipment arrived in a very timely manner. The ring looks wonderful, very sparkly. This ring also takes up a lot of room on your figure. It was exactly what I was looking for."
0,"I ordered a Calliope Muse necklace and got a tiny MAN. Most likely Hercules. Well, yes, we all love Herc, but I wanted Calliope. I should have looked more closely at the picture and the reviews. It's far more hassle to return it and hunt down a new one than it is to just keep it and pass it along as a gift. If it were labeled correctly? GREAT gift. But useless to me now, other than a gift."
0,"Really pretty, small. One stone was already falling out when I got it. I might wear it anyways."
1,"I love this pendant and it is so unique. I have gotten compliments, and am going to give this as a gift to my freinds and family."
1,I had to buy this twice for my daughter since her number is 23 on her basketball jersey.She lost the first one. She just loves it! Wears it all the time. It's a great size and looks good on. She then bought one for her boyfriend who also plays basketball in another number and looks good on him also and he is 6'4. Very happy customer.
1,"Lovely color and very high quality. Not for the newly pierced nipple though. If you are still healing and any nipple fluids are still being issued, DO NOT use this ring. The holes in the ring will capture the dried fluids. Once this happens, trying to clean or remove the ring is most unenjoyable. Simply put, it hurts like hell. Once you are healed though, this is a beautiful ring that looks nice on the beach."
1,I was very satisfied with this ring. It is beutifully made. It has become one of my favorite rings.
1,"This ring is just what I was hoping for. Beautiful, plain, white-gold band. It is ""half round"", which means that it is not as thick standing up off of your finger. It still has the rounded look, but is not so bulky...That is perfect for my smaller hands.Overall, it is a beautiful ring of quality."
1,This ring really looks like the real deal. I did some research on Zirconia and learned that it is more flawless than a diamond and that it takes a very skilled gemologist to tell the difference between Cubic Zirconia and diamonds. This gem refracts light better than diamonds!
1,"I OWN THIS RING AND THE PENDANT TO MATCH.BOTH ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. IT MATCHES WITH ALL MY WHITE GOLD,AND THE RHODOLITE STONES ARE PRETTIER THAN MY RUBIES. LISTEN UP LADIES,THIS IS A KEEPER,THIS IS A WINNER."
1,I purchased this ring last year and I have been wearing it quite often. The craftsmanship is superb. The details are intricately beautiful. It is a true treasurable piece of jewelery and I love it.
1,"this is the perfect piece of jewelry for my goddaughter, who is turning 6 later this month. the package arrived on time and everything was in order. thanks."
1,I bought this ring to wear on my pinkie. It looks great and I have not taken it off since I got it. I love sterling and will definitly order from Gem Avenue again.
1,"the ring is beautiful, I'm very happy with it, and would buy from this seller again."
1,I bought this pendant to match the ring and earring set my wife has. She loves the match and wears it everywhere.
1,"Very nice overall, the pendant was the main attraction, nice size, simple but still elegant. The chain is very delicate and will have to be replaced as I expected. Very pleased she's happy I'm happy! Funny how that works."
1,I received this Pendant today. It is very nice. Just the right size. The chain is a little thin. I will put it on another chain. I will purchase other items from Amazon.
1,"The cut, color and clarity of this pendant is outstanding. The rope accent is a perfect compliment to the stone. Matching earrings really set off a beautiful look!"
1,"I had saved this 130$ item in my cart for later, up until the price dropped to 90$. I found that it was a great deal, both with looks and quality! The construction is, however, somewhat fragile. I would not recommend wearing this necklace every day, but I love it! The only thing is that the price on this item keeps changing; you should consider waiting for ""real"" savings."
1,Beautiful gold over silver majorette boot! Had been looking for this to replace a lost one for years - this was perfect. LOVE IT! Quality is top notch for the price!
1,"I ordered this ring with the goal of any thing with rubies and pearls. I was very pleased with it when it arrived. The stones shine brilliantly, and the setting is stable and secure. It is a very pretty ring, and stands out against other popular jewelry today."
1,"I have had this ring for 5 months now and have had no issues with it at all. I love the way it looks and I get so many compliments on it. I even want have an engagement ring fashioned in the same vintage style. Currently, it is my favorite ring and I wear everyday."
1,The looks and the quality of this necklace was much better than expected. The turtle looks really neat and the chain was strong and good looking. My grand-daughter loved it.
1,"From my husband, for our 10th anniversary. I love these earrings--a beautiful dark blue, and the screwbacks are nice and solid."
1,THIS WAS MY FIRST 18K GOLD ITEM. IT IS SO SMOOTH I NEVER TAKE IT OFF MY FINGER. IT IS TRULY 18K - I HAD IT APPRAISED. I LOVE 7MM SIZE. NOW MY HUSBAND WANTS ONE.
1,"I was hunting for sterling/gold jewlery, and these are so perfect! The whole process was easy and quick."
1,"The band ring was a gift for our granddaughter; it is precisely what she wanted. It was ordered a 2nd time; the first band was shattered in an accident. She liked it so much, we ordered another one for her. The band is striking in appearance by virtue of its simplicity and stark blackness."
1,"The ring looks nice and is unique. It was what I was looking for, and the little gold box with bow packaging was a nice touch. I bought this ring for my boyfriend in February. He's worn it every day since then and it hasn't broken. I worried because some reviews for the other similar gemstone rings mentioned that they shatter. He wears it in a weird spot on the finger and it has flung off a few times but hasn't broken."
1,The ring exceeded my expectations as did the prompt service of the company I bought it from. Beautiful and of exceptional quality the person I bought it for adores it.
1,"This black onyx ring is simply beautiful but I did accidentally drop it on ceramic tile flooring. The ring did not shatter to pieces but only sustained a small chip and that impressed me. While the chip is very small, I do intend to order this excelently priced item again."
1,"This is a simple, yet elegant ring. It came in its own gift box, which surprised me. I love the feel of the band, and how it keeps its luster even after wearing it all day. I highly recommend it."
1,I was very pleased and surprised that it was even nicer than the photo.The product was definitely worth the price.
1,I bought this necklace to go with my renaissance wedding outfit. It matched perfectly and was the look that I wanted. It is made well and has clean lines. The celtic design in the silver work is just what I was looking for. The stone color is clear and a nice shade of peridot green - just like in the picture. The only fault it has with me is that I thought it would be a little bigger (I didnt really pay attention to the listed measurement - my fault). Its about and inch and a half-ish wide. Overall I really love it and would recommend it as a good buy.
1,"My recipient was very happy with this item. It looks very good on her. It is a smidge smaller than it appears in the photo, but that comes with the territory of buying things online."
1,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I actually make other jewelry and also collect gemstones. I haven't got into the metal work yet, so I ordered this necklace. I do however recognize a good gemstone when I see it - the Peridot in this necklace is beautiful!I was pleasantly surprised at the great quality. Thank you very much!"
1,"Beautiful piece at a great price, and delivered quickly. It was one of the highlights of the Christmas holiday for my wife. Thanks!"
1,I bought this necklace and the matching earrings as a gift for my wife and she loves them. They look really nice and seem to be well made too.
1,The quality really shows and I am very impressed. I have already bought 2 for members of my family and friends.
1,This is one of the prettiest rings I have bought. It is high quality. The words on the inside of band are georgous.I would highly reccommand this ring to everyone. I absolutly love it... Definately worth the money....
1,"I have never owned a stainless steel piece of jewelry before, but after considering that my forks and spoons still look shiny after years of usage, well, seemed like this ring would be a great. Right?Absolutely.It's beautiful. The ring itself is crafted very thick and solid. The engraving is gorgeous, and even nicer once the black paint came out. It looks so much more expensive than what it the cost is."
1,I looked all over for the perfect gift for my daughter-in-law when she gave birth to their second child. This was just what I was looking for and at such a reasonable price. I even appreciated the sentiment on the box. I couldn't be more pleased.
1,"This was a gift for my daughter-in-law who is expecting her second child and she loved it and wears it often. For the price, it is a very nice necklace."
1,"My husband just purchased this pendant for my Christmas gift and I LOVE IT!! It is absolutely beautiful, much prettier in person. It's the perfect symbol for a loving family of four. It's the perfect size as well, it isn't really that small, but I checked the measurements first and knew what I was getting. Anything larger would be gaudy."
1,"My husband gave me this for mother's day. Part of what makes it so special is that it's two kids - our infant son died in November. Even though he's not here, he's still an important part of our family and this pendant expresses that for me."
1,LOVE this necklace! Especially the message on the back of the box re
1,"Gave as a gift to step-daughter...I thought it was lovely, she seemed to like it but eh, who can tell? (that would mean she'd have to like something I picked out... LOL...) Seriously, it's a beautiful necklace and represents the family quite nicely... I have three children otherwise I would have kept it for myself :)"
1,My wife says she loves this pendant.She says the chain doesn't catch in her hair at all as her hair is long. Item as described. Shipping was very fast. Completely satisfied. Thanks!
1,"I bought this as a college graduation gift for my oldest daughter because I wanted to give her something special and personal. I wasn't sure if she would like it, she is funny about different types and sizes of jewelry. Being she had been a foster mother for two sisters and then officially adopted them in 2010 I thought I would take a chance. Well, she loves it and she said she was never going to take it off. It really means so much to her because she is so grateful for her new family. The pendent is more beautiful in person than the picture. If you are thnking of getting something unique and personal as a keepsake this is the perfect gift."
1,I gave this to my best friend as a gift for making me God-Mother to her newborn. She has not taken it off since. This is truly unique and says it all. I would recommend this!
1,I absolutely LOVE this necklace! I like that it's not the traditional baby's head hanging from your neck...never did like those. This is a contemporary art piece. I can't believe it's only $25! My only complaint is that I wish they would have offered it in white gold. So very pleased! This makes a great Mother's Day gift!=)
1,"Very good quality for the price. Stamped .925 which means it's genuine sterling silver. The stone sparkles quite a bit, even in artificial light. I recommend removing if washing hands with harsh soap or else risk damaging the finish. Sterling silver does sometimes tarnish, but that is easily fixed with a little bit of silver polish."
0,"I received this ring from my friend as a Christmas gift. It's very nice, and it looks as pictured, but after a few months of daily wear the stone fell out never to be found again. I've never had this happen to me with a ring before."
0,"This ring turned my finger green, and when it comes to jewelry, that's not exactly what i prefer. Cute, but seems to be very cheaply made. Sorry..."
1,"love the ring, the color of the stone,the cut of the stone, sterling silver celtic knot, It's so pretty :)"
1,"The Bracelet Buddy really works. It is light weight but it does the job. I gave one as a gift and the friend liked it too. Thanks, Jane"
1,I had a bracelet buddy for ten years and it suddenly broke. Without it I am not able to put on my bracelets alone. I found bracelet buddy on Amazon and was overjoyed. I ordered a replacement and received it within days of ordering it at my home. I am very happy with the product and especially relieved to be able to put my own bracelets on my arm without any assistance.Bracelet Buddy (Set of 2) - Gift for Mom and Grandma - Made in USA
1,"I really like this. I was having a lot of difficulty putting on my bracelets and was frustrated enough that I wouldn't even buy them if they had a clasp. Using this, I can fasten any of my bracelets with ease now and I don't have to worry about what type of bracelet it is. I haven't had a problem with any of the bracelets I've tried it on so far."
1,The Bracelet Buddy was a gift for my wife this past Christmas. She has told me several times how much she likes it since I'm not always around to help her with difficult bracelets.
1,This is a gorgeous necklace and looks so much more expensive than what it cost me. I've worn it with pastels and deeper gem colors as well and it looked equally fabulous with both. Very comfortable to wear and lays perfectly on the neck. Lovely colors and looks so much prettier in person than on the screen.
1,This was the wedding set that we were first married with. It is so pretty. The only problem is; I lost the top band. It is next to immpossible to buy a replacement. I have looked everywhere because I loved this ring so much. It is a custom fitted band.
1,"This ring is just what I was looking for, in that my watch and bracelet which I wear on the same hand, is two-tone gold so this item compliments perfectly. I wanted a wider band; since I don't have tiny fingers, I wanted a band that was substantial and stately. It is a heavy ring, not flimsy in the least, yet because of the comfort fit, it is extremely comfortable on the finger. The etched design truly sparkles - it is quite eye-catching, yet not overdone. I am extremely pleased with this purchase; the item and delivery were as promised!"
1,"The ring itself was very nice. I liked it because it is a bit more unique than most wedding bands.Unfortunately, I had to return it for a different size since the size guide on the Amazon web site will not give you the correct size. DON'T USE IT. Go to a jeweler and get your finger measured if you don't know your ring size.I did reorder this ring in the correct size and I am very happy with it."
1,"This is an enthusiastic review not only of the ring - which is as beautiful as it looks in the photo here, but of DiMarco Jewelry, which provided absolutely superb customer service when MY error (compounded by Amazon's ring-sizing method) resulted in my ordering the wrong size.True story - my wedding ring was lost when I had to quickly change my surgery scrubs due to being called in emergently on an infected patient.The Mrs. And I love to use Amazon, and we looked and found this beautiful ring. After many years I had forgotten my ring size, and Amazon posted a handy guide to print out, cut out and use to figure out your size. I did this and ordered the ring.The ring came - beautiful as in the photo - and WAY too big. I contacted the company and the nice DiMarco person said ""sorry, we try to inform our customers on the Amazon website to not use the Amazon sizing guide, but we still get lots of people who order the wrong size.""Anyway - I shipped the wrong ring back to them after getting the correct size from a local jeweler. (For those who don't know - any local jeweler will be glad to size your finger gratis.) For a small re-stocking fee DiMarco immediately turned around and mailed my correct size.The ring is beautiful and it was my bad - corrected by the company. Recommended."
1,Love these pins ... I purchase a few before traveling to a country to give out as thank you gifts and rememberances. Good quality workmanship.
1,My daughter bought this for my birthday and EVERYONE comments on this pendant. It is especially striking on a wide silver chain. The only other item I own that gets this many compliments is a $350.00 German made handbag. You can't go wrong for $19.99!!!
1,I love owls and I was looking for a pendant. This one was perfect! The details are beautiful and the moving parts are pretty cool. I have received many compliments. Also an excellent price.
1,"This is a story of love and the remarkable gift that came in the form of this locket. In October of 2008, my dad was diagnosed with end stage lung cancer. He held on and was doing pretty good until Christmas. My mom, an incredible woman, worked hard to keep him at home until the end. On Christmas day, my husband, kids and I, invited them over for dinner. My dad, plugged in to the oxygen tank and using a walker constantly now, had been unable to shop for a gift for my mom. He wanted to get her a locket. My mom wanted something engraved on it, but he couldn't get out of the house to get her anything. So he and I sat down at my computer and we went to Amazon to see what kind of jewelry we might find. We found this locket. I have never ordered jewelry on-line before and didn't know what to expect, but I trusted Amazon so I ordered it. Unfortunately, I didn't order it to be shipped sooner. Dad died Jan 11 in 2009 and the necklace arrived Jan 13th. The kids and I wrapped it in Christmas wrapping paper and took it over to my mom's. I can't thank you enough for the beautiful necklace that you sent. It far exceeded our expectations and my mom has not taken it off since the night she put it on. We are looking for a tiny picture of dad to put in it. I am sure that Dad would have approved of the quality and workmanship too. I just wanted you to know that you made my mom's (and mine too) Christmas. It was a wonderful gift to celebrate nearly 40 years together. Thank you from all of us.Sincerely,Susan L. Gonzales"
0,"This is a beautiful ring, but wearing it is another matter. It should have been smooth on the back side, instead it is the same all the way around and is very uncomfortable to wear. I tried to wear it, but gave up and now it sits in the drawer. Too bad!"
1,"The item was not only shipped very fast, but the pendant is fabulous!! It is a LOT prettier in person than the one in the picture. The one in the picture doesn't look as nice. The price is also great! Love it! A+ for the dragonfly pendant!"
1,she love it a lot. ahe play with it a lot. she like the music a lot... a happy girl
1,It is a gift for my granddaughter she will positively love it. The box is well made and has a great design.
1,"I just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old who is very girly and wanted a jewelry box. It is much prettier than I expected and than it looks in the picture. I really love it, and so does she. It plays ""Swan Lake"" when you open the box and the fairy/ballerina turns around. I plan to get this for all of her friends for thier birthdays."
1,"My Grand-daughter loves my wind up items so when I saw this I knew she would love it! She was in awe when she opened the present and as young as she is, it helps her motor skills."
1,"I was looking for a jewelry box for my 3 year old grand-daughter. This fairy one was so unique. After looking at many others online, this one was a very good buy and turned out to be a hit in the gift department!"
0,"Upon receiving the music box and opening it, I discovered that the mirror inside was mounted extremely crooked, so much so that I had to take it apart (which entailed cutting the material inside), realign it and glue it back together. After doing that, it was fine, but I knew what work I had done on it even though the recipient had no clue. It was very disappointing, to say the least. I'm only thankful that I didn't have it mailed directly to her because that would have been an utter disaster."
1,Absolutely loves this jewelry box. Her sister wants one too. So I need to find something similar but unique for her
1,I love this jewlery box. I bought it for my daughter because I had a similar one when I was growing up. The quality is better than I expected... very cute!
1,This jewelry box is too cute. It is perfect for my two granddaughters ages 4 & 5 and they love them. It is not a toy but more of a keepsake. It is made well but I don't believe that it could be handled excessively.
1,I just got this toy today and it is better than expected. I am so happy and can't wit to give it to my granddaughted. Thank you so much.
0,My daughter loved it but it soon fell apart. She was only 2 when I bought this for her and after about 3 months the doll fell off & the box began to peel. If you do buy this make sure your child is not too young and will be more gentle with it.
0,"Ordered this as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, and the fairy hitches and stops while spinning. Unacceptable for a little girls Christmas present. It is really a lovely box, too bad I got one that doesn't play right. I have to return this."
1,"This box was VERY pretty! It is more of a white iridescent...not the blue in the picture BUT yet VERY pretty. The music sounds great and the ballerina was in good working condition. My daughter (3 yrs old) absolutely LOVES the box and keeps opening and closing it. Honestly, this was a GREAT deal....good quality box for the price you are paying. It also brings back so many memories of my own musical jewellery box as a child...every little girl will love it!!!"
1,"I got this cross yesterday and I love it. It's dainty and lightweight, and the chain is the perfect length to layer with other necklaces. I absolutely love it."
1,I loved it. My brand new son inlaw wore it on his kilt for the wedding. Very quick service. Tory
1,The Scottish Celtic Thisle Cloak Pin looks wonderful on my black wool coat and it sparkles on my red wool scarf. The silver is beartifilly designed; The thistle pin reminds me of the thistle that grew in my yard all summer.
1,I gave this pin to my Sister for Christmas. She ia a poodle lover. She loved the Pearl Poodle Pin and thanked me for it on more than one occasion. She considers it one of her finer pins.
0,This looks really cute on but mine broke after 2 weeks!!! Don't waste your money
1,"This was a gift to my wife. She was immediately impressed with the amazing detail of the piece, and was even more amazed when she realized the bell actually rang with a pleasant tone. Unlike the cheap ""bell"" jewelry you can buy in the department stores, this little bear tinkles like a real bell. My wife has used it as a pendant, but now has it hanging from her rear-view mirror for good luck. She loves it."
1,I received this as a gift from my husband (after much hint-dropping) and could not be more pleased. The quality of the stones is excellent
1,These are very pretty earrings. Stylish and classy. FAST shipping from this company.
1,"I wanted to create a family italian charm bracelet with my daughters first and middle names. I could find my other daugther's first name, but I could not find Jocelyn anywhere, especially spelled like this. My bracelet is complete, and I can wear a token of my family every day!"
1,"I was looking for a nice pair of gold tone hoop earrings and i ordered these and i gotta say im very pleased with them, the size of the earrings i would say are medium size, not too heavy, and the crystal colors are lovely. They are perfect for the price i paid."
1,"What I love about this earring holder is how weighted and balanced it is. You can select and replace earrings without having to hold it up with your ""third hand"". It makes a beautiful display."
1,"I got this ear ring stand for my wife. I had troubles finding one for her, per a request for a special gift. I found used racks online that were cheesy and too childish. This is a nice metal rack, with plenty of spacing between ear rings, and it is sturdy, yet holds delicate jewelry easily. My wife loved the simple and basic feel, and it matches well against almost any decor. One piece construction, medium holes, easy to put ear rings through! Great gift idea or nice retro idea for ear ring storage in plain easy to get at location."
1,My wife makes bead earrings and was looking for a way to display her work. She is very happy with this earring display. It is sturdy and looks very nice.
1,"I have a lot of earrings and they get lost easily, so this was the perfect solution. Also, it is an incentive to buy MORE earrings!!"
1,THe product came quickly and was packaged really well. It was exactly like described and we are very happy with it. I would definately recommend the company and will purchase future items from the company. I was very pleased.
1,This is well worth the purchase. Strong and sturdy with an elegant appearance. No complaintsFast shipping prompt servce
1,I bought this earring display product for my 11 year old daughter. It is lovely; made well; very sturdy. It's a good way to organize and display your inventory of earrings easily.
1,I'm very happy with this product I have all my earings on it with room to spare!
1,"to hold every pair of earrings that I own; but with this stand it is. This stand is sturdy, and versatile, you can hang earrings of various sizes and shapes on it and have plenty of room to spare. I like being able to see at a glance exactly what I'm working with when getting ready to go out; no more rummaging through a jewelry box. I highly recommend this product."
1,"I thought I had a couple pairs of pierced earrings. Now that I purchased this nifty earring hanger, I can placed all pairs, 30 so far in one place. I will be buying the hanger for necklaces and bracelets and another 2 more earring holders for my nieces."
0,"The pearl was kind of nice, but the chain it comes with looks very generic. Also, the service I got from American Pearl was the worst I have ever had on the web. First of all, they charged me for two pearls when I only ordered one. Then I tried to contact them and they took two weeks to get back to me just to tell me they would get back to me. As of now, I am filing a claim with Amazon.com to retrieve the funds American Pearl charged me. If I were you, I would not buy from American Pearl, it will just be a hassle."
1,i got these earrings today and they're even better looking than i thought they'd be! with 3 holes in my ears i'm always looking for filler pieces for my top two holes with a stand out piece in the bottom. these are great! didn't know black could still sparkle like this!
1,I bought this earring for me (btw I am a man) because I have given up on big flashily bling-bling earrings. I think this one is less of an attention getter but it is still good looking. Be aware that this pair of earring is very small.
0,The ring is huge - was surprised considering it was supposed to be a stretch-ring - cannot wear it - very disappointing
0,This ring is pretty but impossible to wear. It is way to bulky and your finger has to be spread away from the other fingers while it is on plus the chips constantly poke into you. One of those ideas that must have been good on paper but just do not translate. I have worn it on a chain before as a pendant and it did look nice that way for a fun casual look.
1,"I paid a great price for this item. Not only are they genuine swarovski's but the piece is more beautiful than I expected. I'm sure you've all seen jewelry that say 'diamond' and 'stone' and what you see is a big hunk of metal with a sliver of stone glued to it.This item is a line of silver with chunks of finely shaped crystals on it. Amazing and when it hits the light, one is mesmerized."
1,This is an exceptional pin and could not have been more perfect if it walked itself to the door. Very impressive and is even better than pictured.
1,"Along with other reviewers, I'd have to say this pin is simply beautiful. It is very well made with great detail. I bought the pin as a gift for my wife and she loves it."
0,I ordered these earrings the color was purple instead of red like garnet is surpose to be. I emailed the company have not heard back from them. They didnt mined taking my money. I thank its unfair how companies can do this to customers
0,I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism
0,The tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase.Poorly made
0,"For the price, it's a pretty good gift along with some earrings. Hard to fish out earrings if they fall below the racks."
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my friend. I own one - and she loved the case, quality - and the amount of earrings that this case holds. Its great for any decor because its clear acrylic."
1,This product is wonderful. Supplier shipped out quickly and in secure packaging. Came with a lovely cloth bag. Jewlery is well-crafted and have already received compliments. Would definitely recommend!
1,"I bought this for my 19 year old daughter and I know she'll love it. It is very well made, smooth against the skin and easy to wear. I bought it on sale so that made this pretty necklace an even better deal!"
1,It's a very beautiful necklace. The shipment was super fast! My friends guess its value from $50-70:) I even can see 925Italy on it. Very happy with this buy.
1,This bracelet is as beautiful in person as it appears online. I've received several compliments. It is a great way to jazz up a casual outfit.
1,"Nvie designs has done it again with great service, excellent prices and gorgeous pieces. I'll buy from them again."
1,We got this item as a present for our daughter's 7th birthday. She really loved it. She loves the music box function and the horse as well. Really cute present!
1,"It plays the classic ""greensleaves"" and has four hidden drawers - perfect for a little girl to put her treasures in. She wants to fall asleep to the music, and I know she's going to take care of it for years to come. Great, great present."
1,I love this product. It looks really nice once you get your earrings in it. Easy to find the pair you want to wear.
0,"This is a neat holder except that you can't put smaller hoops on it because they won't ""wrap"" around the plastic."
1,"NOPE, it won't hold small hoops, but it will give you room for your danglies and chandaliers and regular question-mark wires, and if they fall, they're still safe. Plus, keeps the dust and yuck off. Much, Much better than the fold out kind that makes your earrings go every where when you unfold it. I have cats and this keeps the earrings safe from becoming ""prey"" but also easily accessible early in the morning when I am under-caffeinated and clumsy. Yeah, I had to get another kind of rack for my hoops and I have a pretty box for my posts, but I have 2 of these for my bigguns and got rid of the the accordian-style one."
1,"This product is totally awesome, every woman should have this. Easy to access earrings and looks lovely on a dresser. I would definitely buy for a gift."
1,THANK YOU..PRODUCT VERY SATISFIABLE...AND MINT CONDITION@@!!!THANK YOU..LOOK FORWARD TO BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN..ALSO GREAT COST!!NICE!!VERY NEW!! PERFECT CONDITION GOOD PRICE!! DEFINITELY WOTH BUYING FROM YOU AGAIN!!
1,I got these hoops to make basketball wives earrings i like these and worth it and cute and small for people who don't want them that big
1,"i ordered these earrings because of the price . these are a great set with decent back clips i was really amazed at well made they were and delivery was super fast. love these earrings they are my favorie, pick your size"
1,"Nice collection of earrings & sizes --- light weight, nice quality... thin... not ""too loud or big""..they come with a great clasp for assured safe-keeping while on. The gold appears a little more dressy and the silver for those casual jean days!"
1,These things are junk. I think I'll let my daughter give them to my wife for Christmas so I don't get blamed for buying them.
1,These trays are invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their jewelry properly stored and easily available. They allow you to get rid of all of the boxes that accompanied the pieces of jewelry (which take up more space) and have the advantage of making the pieces instantly viewable. They are the only trays that I know of that come with a cover to keep dust away from your jewelry pieces; they are also stackable. They are worthy of the highest praise.
0,"These compartments are fantastic for jewerly storage. My only issue is the price. For those of you looking for a bargain don t buy here. I found the exact items at Bed Bath and Beyond, priced from 6.99-9.99. Needless to say I was really pissed off. I did not return because I had unpacked and already placed my jewerly away. However, I purchased four other compartments and I paid 9.99/ea. at BBB."
1,I now have about six of these jewelry trays and plan to get six more. They are wonderful!! The clear plastic lid and their stackability make them ideal for the job. Don't know how I lived without them for all these years.
1,I got this because I'm a Leo and I have always wanted a lion charm...a nice one and this one really fits the bill. It arrived in the condition promised and the delivery was very quick.
1,"of this same style and I was way more then pleased. In fact, I was so happy that, right now, I'm purchasing a few more necklaces in simialar styles but with different semi-precious gems. the price is more then fair considering all the work that obviously had to go into construction of the piece."
1,"I was very pleased to receive the ring and wore it with my gold and red stone jewelry set the next day. I hope to find more products from Hope Chest. If this ring is a sample of their typical quality, style, and value, I'll be purchasing many items from them! Thank you for being a responsible, high quality merchant! Please publish more information about other jewelry products with large colored CZ stones! Thanks, Hope Chest, please keep your product lines full."
0,"I bought this for my husband as a present. He wears it often and does like it, but if you open the hinges too far they pop all the way open (hyper-extend) and are very difficult to pop back."
1,"I don't really know what to say. It's the size it said it was going to be and looks exactly like it did in the picture. I've gotten several compliments while wearing it. However, the stone is as orange-y as it looks, so beware of the 'garnet' label. Sometimes garnet is more orange than red."
1,"I couldnt be happier! I usually LOVE huge rings, but this is an exception! Don't get me wrong; this isn't 'petite' but it isnt massive as well. This ring has such beautiful details, is extremely well made, and you couldnt even tell it was a CZ and not a genunie garnet!The color is a deep red, but so sparkly! A true value for price and quality! Highly recommended!"
1,"This ring is not too large but has enough facet and color to give it a good Zing! The price made me a little wary of purchasing it, however the craftsmanship is far above what I could have possibly expected. It is a wonderful ring and the the photos here just don't do it justice"
1,"I bought this piece to celebrate my daughter and I. I am so glad I did. It is very precious. I was concerned that it might be too small, but it is the perfect size. Also the detail in the carving is lovely. It will make a wonderful gift to any mother."
1,"This is absolutely beautiful and the colors are rich, it looks great on my italian charm bracelet"
1,Thank you for offering lovely jewelry at exceptional prices!I was absolutely delighted to open my mail today!You made my day! Thanks!
1,"I love this necklace, the design is really nice and it's not too small or too larg . And usually I have an allergic to copper but this is the first time I wear something made with copper and didn't got any allergic at all. That's why I wear it all the time. Thank you"
0,"I'd like to say first of all that I have bought from Dan's Jewelers multiple times and I am a huge fan of their work and craftsmanship. And really, I have no problem with the craftsmanship here. The pendant is well-made, cool looking, and the cord is reliable. My only grief with this particular item is that it's so damn small and it absolutely looks terrible being so little. There's a lot of detail in this necklace and I think that the pendant should be much larger to show that detail."
1,This little pin is every bit as adorable as it looks in the picture. We are looking forward to giving it to Grandpa this year as part of a bowling-themed Christmas gift. It came packaged very well and in a timely fashion.
0,"This is an okay pendant. The stone is rather small. It might help to look at pendant size measurements if given, before buying. Yet I must say that it is a classy shape and I often end up wearing this over T-shirts for a casual look."
0,That was a disappointment. The 'silver' looks like thin tinplate. Far too cheap to look at. It looked much better on the picture
1,"Great ring, got here fast. I wear it everyday and does not turn my finger colors."
1,Here we see it on many caps and I have never see that as a pendant but I like it.
1,"Service was great, ring is beautiful and of good quality, it was set promptly."
1,This bracelet is as the French would say Le' Magnific. lol. It has a real nice silver finish look. *Note it is not sterling silver* It has a very cute French poodle dangling from it with a toggle clasp that looks so sophisticated. The poodle is wearing a doggy sweater that is accented by pink crystals. One caveat this poodle bracelet is for adults and wouldn't fit small children. The picture doesn't do it any justice because it is really pretty on your wrist.
1,"I love this bracelet. The message fits my personality and I am always getting compliments on it. People always want to look at it. From the price I knew it would be silver toned, not real silver. Despite this, its very cute, particularly the writing and a year later my bracelet still looks great."
1,Made a nice Christmas gift for my roommate who loves the saying. Cute product. Came just as advertised. Thank you.
1,"This is a fun bracelet, it's not silver but silver tone so it turns my skin green, so I just wash my wrist :) It is a little small, I chose to keep it anyway. I like it."
1,"Just as shown in the photo, no surprises. I bought it as a gift and it couldn't have been better"
1,I bought this as a gift for a dear friend. She loved it and has worn it often.
1,"When this product came it was exactly what I expected. The bracelet is a little heavier though, which was a pleasant surprise. It didn't feel like a cheap piece of jewelry. I gave it as a present to my sister, and she loved it."
0,I did not receive product. I contacted the seller twice and never heard from them
1,"Its a lovely bracelet,very good design and nice material, so its the perfect gift,surely I will do a lot of shopping to this seller."
0,"I love the detail of this enameled bracelet, the only disadvantage is that it is heavy. The seller was very prompt in sending it. So very pleased with them."
1,I bought it as a gift.It seems very solid and well made. Quite heavy.My wife loved it.
0,"I am displeased with this seller, because I notified them of my change of address and they confirmed my change of address, and yet I haven't recieved my item 1 month after ordering it.I wouldn't reccommend this seller to anyone."
1,This ring is more beautiful then the picture shows. Dangle rings have always been most beautiful to me it gives your hands a flow of beauty.
1,I was very pleased with the necklace and matching stud earrings that I ordered.They arrived in a very short period of time and the actual product was even nicer than pictured online.I will definitely be a return customer.
1,"Got this for my husband for christmas and it was beautiful, he loved it. He was so surprised I had found one. He had one before from a jewerly store and it fell apart."
1,"Looked better than the picture, came in a lovely box. Gave them as a gift and the recipient really like them. Said he wears them to work all the time."
1,"I bought this for my daughter and I can't say enough good things about it--the color is prettier than in the pic,the design is so cute-also the pic doesnt show the true design of the bow(much prettier on the finger)..shipping was fast and the little box it came in is adorable...buy this ring-you will be happy that you did!!"
1,"Very happy with this buy. We get my sister a charm for every special occasion (graduation, maid of honor, new aunt, etc). Most stores are no longer carrying Italian charms, but this seller has a great selection and this charm is actually nicer ""in person"" than pictured on the site. My sister LOVED it!"
1,"Just lovely. Many compliments on this tennis bracelet. It is stunning. The stones are bright and clear,the basket type gold setting shows the peridots off perfectly. I love it. Green is the color that goes with almost any other."
1,The product was great quality for the price. the earrings looked expensive at such a deal. would definitely purchase from this supplier again.
1,I bought this ring for my teenage niece and she love it. It is perfect for a teen or someone who doesn't like big jewelry. She wears it all the time.
1,"Quality sterling silver at a reasonable price. The ""cut"" makes it kinda flashy."
1,"This charm is well made, excellent detail, good weight, not flimsy like some by other manufacturers. The vendor shipped my package quickly and I had no problems with my order."
1,I purchased two rings from Sabrina Silver and they were both of exceptional quality and the service was great. I will definitely purchase from Sabrina Silver in the future.
1,"Today it is very unusual to find a item the vendor has put such careful thought to each detail as which chain would best fit the pendant. Still more rare is to find quick response when the item needs work. Not only was the written response great but the turn around was outstanding. This was sent as a special gift from my suddenly found soul mate from years past. When it broke I was lost without it. This liquid beauty held the ""key to his heart"" and I wear it always. Now I know where to go first when I am seeking superior quality and craft with a vendor that has pride in the item."
1,"I absolutely love BOMA! and Something Silver always has the best selection (although some times not the best price). That being said, Something Silver is the most consistent with respect to availability and shipping. I have purchased a number of items from them and never have been disappointed!"
1,Bought this as a Christmas present for my 17-year old daughter. She has a smaller piercing above her regular one. Her ears are very sensitive and cannot tolerate anything non-hypoallergenic. They are very small but do look elegant. Love the screw-back feature; ensures that she won't loose the earrings. They're also comfortable to sleep on; posts are not too long. Nice for busy teen who doesn't want to change earrings all the time. Daughter is very happy with these gold posts.
1,"My best friend turned 80 this year. When she confessed to me her favorite ""bad word,"" I knew I had to get this for her birthday.In spite of the incredibly low price, it's an attractive piece of jewelry, even if it's not the most appropriate choice for wearing to church. (I admit, I did suggest it, having been the pastor of said congregation for 6 years...)Needless to say, my dear friend loves it. When she opened it, I thought she was going to blow out her dentures, she was laughing so hard.Life can be so short--don't pass up the opportunity to spread a little joy with a whimsical gift like this."
1,My purchase was great. It was represented just as it really was. The quality is amazing and I was kept informed at all stages of the transaction. Will order again!
0,"it is a nice ring, fits me perfectly, the stone is a good size but i think it turned out a bit expensive even with the free shipping."
1,"Absolutely beautiful. It was a gift for my daughter (who makes jewelry), and she was totally impressed with it. A great addition to her wardrobe. Also, delivery was really fast."
0,"We were going to a 70's disco party and I thought this BIG DADDY ring would look great. The ring is actually plastic, no metal...and the part that attaches on to you was damaged in shipping. It's junk."
0,"This item is no good!!!!! Could't even wear the ring, The bands that go on your fingers are uneven and are suppose to be adjustable yet they were not"
0,"I took it out of the package and 3 of the 4 rings fell off. So, that was disappointing. Wenever got to use it. It looked fun in the package"
1,This is a great pin. Will go nicely with my little boat outfit. Great for the summer or winter. I love this pin as well. The nice leather work brings it out better
1,"These are GREAT Prada pins that come with Prada box, tissue, and authenticity card. Priced right! I bought 3 for gifts! Thank you Amazon! Debbie"
1,"Beautiful earrings. Great color, the setting is secure, and they catch the light. Great price for great quality. My Mom loved these for her Birthday."
1,"I scored big points with my mom by giving these to her for her birthday. She wants a matching ring now. The blue stones are a color she really loves. Take that, sis! :)"
0,"They are very nice earings. The shippment is fast. For the price, it is a good deal. I only feel the color is kind of light, not dark enough."
1,"I got these as a daily deal, and I'm so glad that I did. Even though I had to wait a couple months, they are worth it. The price is fantastic, (even the regularly listed price), for a very nice cut, vibrantly green and well matched stone. The setting is sturdy, and ranks right up there with very expensive jewelers. Simply a can't miss earring!"
1,"Far more than I expected for a mere $30. Remarkably clear, with rich and uniform color. Clean, elegant cut. Very well-matched pair in strong settings. Strong incentive to follow up by buying more."
1,"Peridot is my birthstone. Twenty to 30 years ago, I purchased 6 mm round peridot earrings for around $110 from I. Magnin. The oval earrings from Amazon compare favorably in the amount of gold and stone size. From there, the color and cut of the perfectly matched peridots on the Amazon pair are clearly superior. The picture doesn't do them justice. These earrings cost me less than $18 including super saver shipping. Anyone who loves peridots is going to love these earrings."
0,"I ordered these earrings for my sister for her birthday. I had read another review that said the posts were on the top of the earring, but I double checked the images and they clearly show the posts being in the center of the stone. This is important because if the post is at the top of the stone the earrings sit too low on your ear and they look weird. Sure enough, when I asked my sister about the location of the posts (she lives in another state, so I haven't seen them personally) she said that they were on the top of the setting. Needless to say, I'm upset. Obviously, the images are supposed to be an accurate depiction of what you are buying!!! I feel deceived. That being said, she did say that stones are very clear and pretty and that she doesn't mind the posts being on top as she has long ear lobes (she could have been saying that so she didn't hurt my feelings). Anyway, be forewarned the posts are on the top of the setting, not in the center."
1,"I waited a long time for these to be shipped and quite honestly, I signed on to cancel the order only to find they were finally preparing for shipment. Since I'd ordered them as an early August birthday gift and it then was almost September, these became no longer a gift for this year. In December, someone else will receive a lovely pair of pretty green peridot earrings that can be worn every day. They are of a very fine quality that I would definitely wear myself. I see nothing to criticize about either these bright stones or the well-made yellow gold earrings. Nicely matched, too."
1,"They are a nice size. They have good stones with the color represented as in the picture. Also the setting is perfectly simple and clean, which I really like."
1,These are attractive earrings. The stones are clear not flawed or cloudy. The setting is secure. I wear them at least once a week. They would make a lovely gift.
1,"I bought these earrings for a gift, and I was very, very pleased with the quality. They are exactly as pictured. I would highly recommend this item...especially at this price!"
1,"OMG, much more than i expected, so happy i took the word of the positive reviewers...had reservations about buying a second pair online, the previous pair, not from the amazon collection, stones were way smaller than i expected, backs were so small that once you dropped one it was gone, just too small to find, thats how i wound up buying this pair...what an absolute bargin these were, thank you amazon, first yes, the stones are lighter than the photo, for me i like the colored ice look they give, stones to me look 1/2 carat,reasonable amount of gold and the backs, though not as big as they were made many years ago, still they are adequate and bigger than the one i just lost.if you are on the fence about this one, i do not believe you will have any regrets if you do purchase them..."
1,"I was very happy with the earrings. Actually I was surprised at the quality. They're not AAA grade peridot, but they still have good color and no defects. Additionally, the stones were solidly set with no jiggle. For the price and buying them sight unseen, I was extremely happy with the product."
1,The size is very good and the color is intense. It was given to me as a gift. It completes a set that I have
1,"These earrings are of good quality and have a nice clarity to them. Be forwarned that because of their size they may have a tendency to fall forward on the ear. I believe this can be rectified with larger earring backs. However, don't wear them as often as I could. Otherwise, they are a beautiful pair."
1,"Oh well, I bought this earrings for myself because I am stressing out looking throughout the jewelry store and now I don't think I have to go all the way just to buy myself a nice and very elegant earrings!!! I really like it! This one is just right for affordable but quality earrings!!!"
1,"I was very hesitant in ordering these earrings, thinking that they would be poor quality and small for the price. I was very impressed when I opened the box. The quality was above my expectations. The color is a deep, rich purple and they are a nice size. I received them faster than the estimated date for delivery which was great too.Thanks,Amy"
1,"I bought these as a Christmas present, but I really think I may have to buy a pair for myself. These are beautiful!"
1,I think I went to every jewelry store in the area and no one had smoky quartz anything. I found these and had them shipped right away. They were perfect. They even matched the ring my mother had. She loves them.
1,"Lovely pair of earrings in just the right size...perfect for double pierced ears with a coordinating larger hoop or dangle earring, or to wear by themselves. Rich brown coloring."
1,"The earrings look just like the picture, the stud stays secure in place, the stones are lightweight and comfortable to wear."
1,I bought the earrings for my niece and was impressed with the size. They're gorgeous. Definitely worth the money.
0,"I was disappointed with the color of the stone. There was no color, where I expected a light color as shown on the site. I have no complaints about the quality of the stud, but I was disappointed with the stone color."
1,"I haven't worn pierced earrings in years;I thought they were sealed. When I discovered that they were indeed open, I sought some simple gold post types to wear. When I saw my March birthstone set in a simple gold setting, I couldn't resist it. The actual earring is so elegant! 'Tis exactly as described, and more! Wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty-starved lobes makes me feel like royalty! And for such a small price with the security of Amazon!What a joy!Sincerely,Miss Agnes Crosby"
1,I was very happy with this purchase. I had looked at other websites and in fact ordered the same earrings as these but kept the ones from Amazon and returned the others. The quality of the earrings I kept were superb to the other ones. I also appreciated the manner in which the earring arrived in a nice earring box.
1,"Wife loved it. Great ring, wonderful design and high quality. What more can you ask for?"
1,I think that this item is very nice and it looks even better on my finger. I even received alot of compliments on this ring. so again thank you very much. I am very satisfied
1,"I wear this ring almost every day. It's not too bland, and yet it doesn't scream for attention. I usually wear it on my thumb just cause it doesn't really fit any of my other fingers, and it looks pretty nice. After searching for a while for an everyday ring, I am very glad I found this one. :)"
1,"My wife loves this ring, altho she has more expensive rings, she says its the thought that counts and that makes me feel good too so if you want to make her happy, amd feel good yourself try this little honey, you wont regret it."
1,tthe ring was the best gift i could have ever ask for my husband bought me the twin heart ring i used to have one a cheap one it messed up and ive wanted one for years and he found this one is so much better than my old one it so strong and beautiful i love it thank yall sooooooo much will buy from yall again.......................
1,"I bought this ring on Ebay for approximately the same price. I bought it to wear as to work so I don't destroy my diamond engagement ring, but I still have a ring to wear. (I've destroyed many rings by wearing them to work) This heart ring is cute and fits perfect. I love it, so much that when I wear my diamond I wear this one on my other hand just so I don't have to take it off"
1,"I bought the Emotional Twin Heart .925 Sterling Silver Love Ring from Gem Avenue. I was very pleased with their courtious, fast and honest service. The price was also very reasonable. I would and probably will do business with them again in the future. I am very please and recommend them for anyone to use. The ring was absolutely beautiful. I brought two different rings one for each of my neices, both heart rings because they like hearts. I know that they will love them. The rings came in these little cute boxes with a cute little bow on top of each one. Thanks so much for the wonderful service."
1,I bought this same ring at Kohl's. My daughter loved it as it fit her tiny finger. Unfortunately she lost it and her heart was broken. And of course the store had no more. I was so excited to find it at Amazon the price was very close to the store's. But the best it was in her size and it can in time for Christmas. Thank you thank you Amazon. I will be order from you again real soon.
1,"Stunning. It looks just like the picture. If you are a fan of tanzanite, this is an excellent purchase. And a good price too."
1,"Gave this beautiful pendant to my daughter (birthstone color) when she graduated high school a few years ago. WHAT a huge hit, and her sister eyed it till she left for college! She wears it with most everything and it is a very nice size. The length of the chain is perfect where it lays on your body. The picture really does NOT show the beauty of the color of the blue. It is like the color of our warm waters here in Florida. TRILLION may be the cut, but it makes her look and feel like a trillion she said!"
1,"I have not had an occasion to wear this pendant to date, however I am pleased with its appearance and plan to order the matching stud earrings in the near future. Marianne Lewis, West Monroe, La. (USA)"
1,These are a perfect sized stud earrings. The ruby cubic zirconia is very close to the real thing.
1,These earrings were even better than I hoped. My wife loves them. The emeralds are a perfect natural green just a shade more transparent than translucent. The baguette diamonds look larger in person. Overall they have quite a lot of sparkle and that emerald flash of pure green. I have purchased a lot of jewelry for my wife over the years and consider these one of my best purchases for the money.
1,"This ring is just gorgeous! The gemstones are 100 times more beautifully in person. It comes in a ring box and another slightly larger square box so it's easy to wrap, and might elude to there being something other then jewelry in the box. The ring itself is not to big, or ostentatious, and gives that nice flawless look of elegance. Very good value for the number of stones placed on this ring! Hopefully my mother will like this gift as much as I did, when I give it to her on Christmas morning."
0,"I must preface this review by saying that I have bought several other things from this seller (Silver Insanity) and have been very well satisfied with their quality. This ring, however . . . I liked it when it arrived. It was very pretty and shiny and it was a good weight for me--not too heavy and not too light. Just what I was looking for (I thought). After a few weeks of wear, however, it not only became scratched, which I fully expected as I lead a somewhat active life, but it also became dented, which I did not. From the reviews I read prior to purchasing this ring, I knew it was hollow. That was fine with me because I knew that if a ring of this width was solid, it would be too heavy for me to wear and be able to do what I need to do. However, I did not think the metal would be so thin that it would dent with each and every knock. I was wrong. I kept this ring and did not complain to the seller as it was entirely my own fault for not exercising common sense when buying it. Being hollow, there is no way to know how thick the outer or inner layers are and I failed to consider that when deciding whether or not to buy it. I will not shun Silver Insanity due to this one piece of shoddy merchandise. If there is another item that they offer which I like and want, I will not hesitate to buy from them."
1,"Expected what I received... had no issues with the merchandise. For the cost of the charm, decent quality and acceptable size."
1,"Daughter love her chain, quick delivery... ahead of schedule. I would highly recommend this product. Beautiful luster"
1,"I needed a long silver chain so I shopped all the on line silver shops but couldn't find what I needed. Finally I checked out Amazon & sure enough, there was my chain at the length I wanted & at the price I wanted. I just recieved it & it's perfect! I have a special cross & it fits just beautifully. From now on, I'll check Amazon FIRST! Thank you!"
1,I ordered two of these as gifts and was very pleased with the product that showed up. The colors matched the pictures well and they are very cute. I would consider ordering more.
1,Nice hamsa earrings! I bought it as a present for my girlfriend and she wears them everyday! A balanced and shining hamsa.I recomend this ones.
1,"I am addicted to jewelry!! this is a beautiful cross, the garnets are a nice color, and overall I am very pleased with it."
1,Received the frog pin and I LOVE IT. I've worn it a few times and have received numerous compliments on each occasion. Thanks for the listing!
1,"This mothers ring came out beautiful, my mother has not taken it off since I gave it to her ."
1,"Not only is the ring beautiful, the jeweler was very accommadating in having the ring reach us in time. We appreciate the care and quick receiving of the ring. Thank you!"
0,"They didnt have any stop on them to keep them on, and the chain felt funny to her. They just didnt feel right when she wore them"
1,"For the price a very nice piece of jewelry, attractive, masculine. Happy I bought it."
0,Real jade does not break by simply trying to squeezing it on a finger...I seriously doubt this item is genuine jade as the seller claims it to be.
1,Recieved this ring in a timely fashion. It did last a long time. I had this ring for about 2 years. Because of the material it is very fragile. Smacked it against a marble table and broke it right off of my finger. Definitely will order another one to replace the old one. :)
1,"I bought this ring due to the fact that my original simple wedding ring does not fit me anymore after my pregnancy.My hubby and I decided to buy a matching set when we go to Peru and for the time being I would buy a ""cheap"" replacement.But let me tell you I think I am going to keep this one! It looks so real!!! I just love it !!!"
1,"A must get! The ring is so pretty, great shine but a little bulky for my fingers but overall very good quality. I wear it all the time and people think it is real especially when the lights are dim. Service was great and received my ring in no time. Will buy again from this buyer."
1,"ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL BRACELET FROM SECUREHOOP THAT I BOUGHT AND DIDNT HAVE TO BREAK THE BANK.CANT WAIT TO WEAR IT AT THE BEACH THIS SUMMER,THANKS SECUREHOOP FOR WONDERFUL JEWELRY AT AFFORDABLE PRICES."
1,I purchased this ring and I was very happy because it is a beautiful ring. It's a little fancier than I expected so I will wear it on special ocassions.
0,"The Swiss Blue stones are pretty, clear and sparkly. But lighter blue than pictured. I would consider them a little darker than Sky Blue Topaz, but not quite Swiss Blue Topaz. A shade lighter than Swiss Blue is the best description. The setting is nice, just not sure if I'm going to return it. I bought it as a gift for my step daughter to wear to a wedding she is a bridesmaid in. Her gown is Caribbean Blue. Swiss Blue is a perfect match for that color. If the color of the stone were a ""true"" Swiss Blue, I would definitely keep it. I'm just so disappointed it is not the color blue pictured. Great price though for the quality of the item."
1,"I am completely satisfied with this ring. It has bigger stones and a nicer style than comparably priced rings. If you are looking for a 3-stone mother's ring, this is by far the nicest I found. It came beautifully presented in a wooden ring box and velvet bag!I am impressed and very pleased."
1,A beautiful piece of jewelry. Quality product and responsive customer service. My wife really appreciates it as a gift. Thank you.
1,"At regular cost I don't think this is worth it, but at the nicely discounted price I got this at it was definitely a good value!"
1,"I spend most of my time in Africa on business and my sister has been after me to bring her Giraffe ear-rings for ages. The ones I have found here have been poorly made and the one nice pair I found went missing from my suitcase at an airport. I then saw these on Amazon and knew she would enjoy them.They arrive on time for Christmas, nicely wrapped and a great value."
0,"This bracelet seemed a little long for me and was actually a little more than 7"" - I need a 7"" bracelet tops. It was very pretty and the width of the link was great. I was sorry to send it back but the company was very good about giving me a credit. If you like a 7 1/4"" bracelet, you may like this one."
1,The necklace is absolutely adorable. I work at a middle school and the kids constantly comment on how much they like the necklace. I love it a lot. It's very comfortable and easy to keep clean.
1,"Wow, this ring is beautiful. The size and color of the stone is amazing. The picture does not do it justice. Just beautiful!!"
0,this is a pretty bangle. its just kind of flimsey. but nice for the price
1,Read two good reviews on this necklace before deciding to order it. The necklace came beautifully packaged and was just as pictured. Very good choice as a gift.
1,I loved this star. I bought it for my friend as a Christmas present and she loves it. It absolutely sparkles whichever way she turns and she gets so many compliments on it. A wonderful product. Very much worth the price and then some.
0,"It's advertised as a Swarovski product, but there is no Swarovski marking anywhere on it as required for their products."
1,It is truly beautiful. Almost looks like a light is in it. I get lots of compliments whenever I wear it :D
1,Honestly for $10 I wasn't expecting too much but when I opened the cute little silver box that this pendant came in I was shocked at how sparkly this cute little star was! I wore it out the night I got it (just running errands) and got a bunch of compliments on it! I'm a sucker for anything sparkling (my husband will tell you how I browse through the Swarovski store wiping drool from my mouth) and this pendant sure fits the bill! True that there is no documentation or even a stamp on the box to say that it's genuine swarovski but it's so pretty who cares!
1,This was a gift for my fifteen year old grandaughter who said it was beautiful! Great service. it was delivered to her on her birthday! Thank you so much!
1,"I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THEIR BRACELETS,BUT THIS ONE HAS A SPECIAL QUALITY TO IT,IT LOOKS SO EXPENSIVE,AND IS SO PRETTY,MATCHES EVERYTHING,WHAT CAN I SAY,I GUESSS THE LORD WAS GOOD TO ME,FINDING THIS AT A PRICE I CAN AFFORD,THE FIRST TIME I WORE IT,I GOT A COMPLIMENT,EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT,I LOVE THIS BRACELET."
0,"While I'm sure that this bracelet is lovely, I would like to let you know that if you have a Piercing Pagoda in your local mall, they sell Italian silver 925 stamped charm bracelets (7-8inches) for less than being charged here. Even with tax the ultimate price of the bracelet is cheaper than purchasing it online and paying shipping. My 7 inch bracelet is well made, hasn't lost any of its shine, and I only payed 19 dollars.I cannot imagine that the quality differs drastically from this product to the one I purchased. It is stamped with ""Italy"" like the above bracelet, as well as ""925"" and you also don't have to wait for it to arrive in the mail."
1,"Loved the bracelet! It came on time and was exactly what I expected. It is beautiful and well made, perfect for a charm bracelet."
0,"Let me give you a hint, I found this same one on the side walk, looking for the owner I looked it up, this thing has a broken clasp and the ""shiny silver"" people are talking about now looks like a vending machine bracelet. I was surprised to see this thing cost as much as it did because it looks like it came from the dollar store, so if you want a bracelet that you will end up loosing because the clasp breaks, and looks like trash, pick this one."
1,"The base for a ""life"" bracelet being built.Beautiful - color is brilliant, moves freely and sturdy construction. Highly recommend this bracelet."
1,"It came well wrapped and well protected. Beautiful, shiny, sparkling! Better than described!"
1,I bought two and added charms..one Harry Potter themed and one Twilight themed...the college aged nieces LOVED THEM!!!!!
0,"Purchase these for my daughters, comparing these to the one I purchase for my wife at the local jewelery store (not paying much more than this one) they seem like costume crap, even the feel seems cheap....and so close to xmas it's hard to exchange now..even bought a number of charms for the both of them....I remember getting my kids fake jewelery out of the vending machines that look about the same...sorry but would not buy again...NO WAY"
0,"Received these as a gift off my wish list...I do love the style of these earrings, but the quality is a little lacking, which is to be expected for this price. The backing on one of the earrings is a bit loose so it has me worried that I might lose one earring. Other than a slightly loose clasp, very cute earrings and overall I'm pleased."
1,"I bought a pair of these earrings for my daughter and she loved -- wore them every day. Then, about 4 or 6 months later I bought a pair for myself and loved them so much I wore them every day. They are very light and the perfect size. After a couple of years, my daughter lost one of her earrings. One of mine got severely misshapen from encounters with the over-the-ear headset I wear at work. The one downside for these earrings are a little soft for everyday wear. Still, I plan to buy another pair."
0,These earrings began to get a white haze on them shortly after I received them. I keep them in the same jewelry box as my other silver jewelry so it can't be because of storage.
0,"Good finish. After I received them i realized that they would probably look better in a smaller size, for my taste."
1,The product arrived quickly and without a hitch. I really liked the earrings when I saw them. They were better than expected. I'm very pleased. Thank you.
1,Bought bracelet and matching necklace while they were on sale. Absolutely no complaints--good quality silver and weight for the money.
1,"I'm so pleased with the quality and the looks of this necklace I had to order the whole set. (Necklace, earrings, and bracelet) It looks great either dressing up or down. I give it 5 stars because it deserves it!"
0,The necklace in the picture looks a lot thicker and heavier than it is. For a two hundred dollar necklace it's very cheap looking. I wouldn't have paid more than twenty five bucks for the necklace!
1,"These are very gorgeous, very delicate earrings. The length is quite long, about chin length, but they're so light weight you hardly notice them in. Seller is quick to ship and I was overall very pleased with their product!!Sarah Beesleywww.scentsy.com/beesley"
1,This was a gift for someone. when i received it and looked at them they were just as expected. she loved it.
1,"excellent value, my wife loves it. so does my daughter. it is not gaudy or over the top. just a simple small butterfly in sterling silver. excellent purchaase"
1,"I give this to my mom, she couldn't like it more, it's very beautiful and elegant necklace."
1,This is a very nice necklace and is of realitivly good quality for the price.
0,"This was probably worth the discounted price I paid...the previous reviews were absolutely correct; it is suited for a child or small person, although it touts an 18"" chain. The chain is very cheaply made and that 18"" is a stretch at the outside link of the adjustment, which has no ""tail"" link to use for fingertip feel. Likewise, the hardware on the other side is so conservative of materials that it is difficult to even hold the very small ring open long enough to reach the back of the neck when trying to put it on without assistance. The butterfly is nice, but just that...nice. If I had it to do over again, knowing now...I wouldn't have ordered it. But there's nothing faulty enough to warrant sending it back, either. Again, for a child it is a lovely size and gift."
0,"I got this originally for my wife, but my daughter loves it so much, and it is about a nice size for a child or teenager..good value for what you get. thx"
1,This ring is very beautiful!!! Not too fancy & but not plain. I would recommend this as a gift .Very pretty!
0,"After reading all the grave reviews on this item, I decided to give it a try and I purchased it. After receiving it, my first glance of this baguette &#34;diamond&#34; ring I was dissappointed. Firstly, these are the worst baguette &#34;diamond&#34; ring I've ever seen. Baguette diamonds are the most clear and sparkling cut which make it a special cut. After careful examining this item and have seen all kinds of &#34;diamonds&#34; of all grade, these diamonds look very much like &#34;promotional diamonds&#34; to me. Real baguette diamonds of any grade should be a bit clearer. never this cloudy for baguettes. This item of &#34;baguette diamonds&#34; are cloudy within the stone through and through; which lead me to strongly believe that this is &#34;promotional diamonds&#34;. Sorry, but this item simple did not go with my existing diamond ring. I had to return this item for it was not acceptable as &#34;real&#34; diamond baguette chips. However, if you do not know any better you can be mislead regarding the difference between &#34;promotional grade&#34; and &#34;real diamonds&#34;. I want it to work for me due to the price, but it didn't."
1,"This ring is so beautiful, this is one purchase that I am so glad I made. The quality and clarity are exceptional. This ring is well worth the money, you will not be disappointed."
1,The Silver Polished 1st Lieutenant Officer Insignia Set is absolutely beyond compare. I'm definitely very satisfied and I'll be doing business with this vendor again. Thanks!
0,"This was my worst experience I will never purchase anything from the Netaya jewelry.I had place an order with them almost two months ago and they never place my order and I called back three times, it got to the point where I spoke to one of the managers and she was the worst rude, no customer service experience and she said that they had finally place my order and ask me if I wanted or not. I don't recommend this jewelry store to anyone."
1,"I bought these as a gift for my mom, she loves them! I even bought her more, the ruby and the sapphire! Shipped very fast! Great price, really nice stones!"
1,"These bangles are beautiful. Mine came linked together, which limits the versatility of this product. However, for my purposes it does not detract at all. They have a nice, musical ring when they move on my arm."
0,"/It was a good price, I had look everywhere for one, however it was not! as advertized it look like a toy went it can and did not fit even a ten year old.I returned this bangle last week and have not! got credit back on my card yet. If the product is returned promptly then so should the money be returned quickly. First thing from Amazon that I have ever gotten and I was happy with. Roxann /1-9-2013"
1,I am SOOO happy that I took a chance on these earrings. They are just beautiful -- incredible sparkle and believable size. I think I'll give them as Christmas gifts this year and maybe buy myself another pair!
1,These are lovely. The are BELIEVABLE and even better is they are 14KT. Couldn't be more pleased!!
1,"this is exactly the ring i have been waiting for. Big bold and beautiful, workmanship is incredible, stone is nicely polished smooth."
1,This toe ring is exactly what I needed for the summer! I always loose my toe rings so I get nervous buying more pricey ones. This toe ring was inexpensive and SO great for the price! Definitely ordering more.
1,I bought several of these to share with friends who celebrate Pi Day. The pins look great and I received several compliments from my nerdy friends.
0,"I wasn't extremely impressed when I received this product, but then again it was inexpensive. The band with the cz looks good but the other silver band had rough edges and I just didnt like it. I would recommend it for a teenager or youth. I will say it was very cute for the price. Great design."
1,This is a promise ring bought for my daughter who is pregnant and due in May. The father of the baby and I thought it would be cute to make a onesie that said my daddy promises to always be there for me and you and this is a token of his promise attached by a little blue ribbon for her to untie. The funny thing was she thought he would buy her a promise ring for valentine's day. Can't wait until their son is born to see her reaction.
0,"The ring looks pretty different from the picture online.CZ stones are really small.Although it's ok for its price, I still feel a little deceived."
0,"the ring is beautiful but one of the stones fell out the second day i had it. i still wear it occasionally, but have to turn it a certain way so it doesnt show. ok for the price, but stones could be set better."
0,"For the price this ring is okay. I was not blown away at how pretty it is like I have been with some of the others that I paid the same amount for! From a distance, it is BEAUTIFUL, just don't let no one see it up close!!"
1,"This has to be one of the loveliest crystals I have ever seen. The cut is wonderful, the color is rich, and as the light goes through it you see every color of the rainbow. My daughter swears she sees a ""heart"" in the middle. It does look like a red center when the light hits it right. A great buy!"
1,This is a beautiful pendant. The color is so rich and the size is perfect. I'm still amazed at the quality of this piece of jewelry for the price. I couldn't be happier with it. Do not hesitate to get this for yourself and enjoy all the compliments that come with it.
1,I wish the picture could show you the beautiful facets of this crystal when you turn it back and forth in the light. I will be buying more of these for gifts because I refuse to give mine up. Great gift for yourself or anyone you even remotely like.
1,Extremely fast arrival and is exactly as pictured. It reflects the colors beautifully and fits on most standard chains. I am very pleased with it.
1,"I got 3, one ea for my wife, her aunt and our daughter and I knew they would trade off, but I think the blue is my favorite Easy to see because of the deep color and VERY good prices!"
1,This is a very beautiful ring and is true to size. I love it.
1,"I ordered two of these pendants for Valentine's day gifts for my sons' girlfriends. The pendant is very beautiful and both noticeable and subtle at the same time. I had never seen pink jade before but it is a very pale, soft pink and looks lovely against all skin tones. I purchased, also from this site, the sterling silver Italian 1mm box chain to hang the pendant from, but it would be beautiful on a silk ribbon or cord as well."
1,"I purchased two braclets for my great granddaughter, and was very impressed; so was my granddaughter. I was also nice of Amazon.com to have them shipped to my grandaughter's apartment in another town. Will surely be ordering more gifts, especially with the holidays coming up. Thank you Amazon.com."
1,I am an army aviator and needed some wings for a small project and these are just like the real thing.
1,The only Onyx and Amethyst necklace I could find that looked great. Most others where gaudy.My wife loved it. By the way They're the 2 birth stones for February which is why I hunted for a necklace made of the 2.Great craftsmanship.
1,I have bought four of these chains and I am elated with all of them. They don't get tangled up in my hair or ride up on the back of my neck. They are very comfortable and light to wear all day long. These chains are great for lockets and other charms fit nicely too. These chains are a great price and seem pretty durable.
1,Very dainty yet sturdy sterling silver chain packaged in a handy storage pouch. Quick delivery. Would from this merchant again.
1,"It lasted about two weeks & I really liked it, but the clasp broke. I was pleased at first, but ended up a little disappointed."
0,"These tags are difficult to write on because of a glossy finish. They made my jewelry look classy, but I won't buy them again. The seller is great to work with."
1,"My son loved the anchor cruifix. He told me he was going to cherish it long as he lives, he loves it.. It is very beautiful...."
0,"The ring is very pretty, and seems worthwhile, but we found that it catches on clothing, and even upholstery fabric at times."
1,"I just recieved this beautiful garnet pendant, the color of the garnet is perfect,a true burgundy,and the workmanship is excellent,it almost looks like white gold,i am really pleased with it."
1,"I was very pleased with the quality of this pendant. The description was accurate and shipping was on time, I would definitely purchase this again for the price if I ever needed an inexpensive gift for so one. My husband was very happy on Christmas when he opened this, his love for the water and boating it was the perfect gift!!"
1,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. The ring was exactly as described and beautiful. The wife loves it and wears it as often as she can with various outfits. Will definitely be doing business with this vendor again!
1,"The length of this necklace falls in good proportion to a typical V-neck sweater. The green and pink gold of the leaf motif slider provide interesting and enjoyable contrast to the bright, yellow gold of the necklace without overwhelming it or looking tawdry. The overall effect of the piece is mature, tasteful and and noticable without being overstated."
1,"I got this ring years ago, I'v been wearing it everyday since. The ring still looks great, it has survived it all.I went to the beach where sand got into it at one point, but even after that, the spinning action is still smooth. (I recommend taking it off if you are going to the beach.) The design of this ring is still beautiful after all the years I have owned it. This ring is worth the money."
1,"These are just great. Very pretty, I especially love the opal and silver. I wear them to work and one got caught in my collar and fell off. I retraced my steps and found it had been run over by a pallet jack! The stones were fine, and the post was intact although bent. Easy enough to straighten.You'll get compliments wearing these!"
1,"Very nice deal! Cute super tiny nose studs, very tiny sterling silver studs for those who want a slightly visable nose stud...I highly recommend these studs, if you have a second or third ear piercing, they'll work well for you :)If you're looking for a little more visable look then purchase the 2mm sterling silver studs instead, they're great too! :)Wonderful seller, highly recommend 5 stars =)"
1,"These tiny studs are great as nose studs rather than earrings per say :)Unless you prefer a super tiny stud for multiple piercings, then these studs will work fine, especially if you have a smaller gage piercing- Otherwise try the 2mm size, they may work better for you if you're looking for the hardly noticable look =)Great seller, happy w/ my purchase!2 thumbs up!Thanks!5 Stars...."
1,"I have never been able to find such a small nose stud, and finally did! I get compliments on it all the time"
0,These were so tiny that they went right through! I just got my nose pierced and wanted something for days when I needed to be more discreet. I can't wear these. I am so sad. Love Sabrina Silver. Won't rate them really low because they have wonderful jewelry..but these did not work for me.
0,"Please save your money, this item is not worth it. It does not stay in your nose and the post (end) of it sticks out.DO NOT ORDER!"
1,These stud earrings are a nice size.
0,I will say that you get a little less than you pay for with these earrings. They look like a pair of walmart bargain bin earrings.... not worth the 38.00 with shipping that I paid. I am still going to use them as a gift only because I dont have time to replace them.
1,"Everyone at work loved this, a great gift, at an excellent price. Fast shipping as well."
1,"Purchased as an anniversary gift and it is just beautiful. Service was great, too. No problems at all with the order."
1,"I own this bracelet, I have had many people admire this piece of jewelry. It is a pleasure to wear, lookes good with jeans or a more dressy outfit."
1,My husband bought me this ring (in white gold)as an anniversary present and I love it. It looks good by itself or with an engagement ring. Would love to eventually get one in yellow gold to wear on the occasions I wear yellow gold jewelry.
1,"I bought these earrings as a gift for a coworker and I was very pleased with their quality for the price! They were as beautiful in person as they were in the picture and the shipping speed from the company was good as well. The silverwork, though unploished, is dainty and attractive and the stones were well fitted and well facetted. I was extremely pleased with this purchase and my coworker seems to love them as well, she wears them frequently."
1,This is a very delicate and fine piece of jewlery. I placed it on my Granddaughter's charm braclet and it is a very attractive addition.
0,My husband bought these for me for Christmas and they are not what I expected based on the product description and photo.The description reads
1,This is my favorite toe ring ever. It is sturdy and looks great with my sandals or my dressy shoes!
1,a nice ring for the price. I have had it a while and like it alot. I do recieve lots of compliments whrn I wear it
1,I've recently gotten my bellybutton piercing. I'd highly recommend. It looks just like the picture and has an amazing glow. Looks awesome at parties :)
0,"if the zirconia was any smaller i would have lost it in the box, they should show you a true to life picture so that you could decide the size you want."
0,"The diamonds were great HOWEVER amazon had a problem with their databases that delayed a lot of peoples stuff that day, I needed mine by a certain date for a certain birthday. When I knew it was not going to get here and trust me I paid for next day shipping I tried to cancel the order so I could just get them locally. I couldn't becuase the order status was preparing to ship (it said this for two days b/c of their database issues) so I wrote them about 5 email and continued to get cookie cutter responses about how I could check my order status online SO I called and was told well you won't be charged for the shipping... I didn't ask for free shipping I asked for my money back so that I could go get my wife something locally and again was told there was nothing they could do for me b/c the status of the item showed preparing to ship and they are having problems with their databases and i just need to understand that. Sorry but the page said if I ordered it by 3 p.m. it would be here the next day it should be and I am not daddy megabucks so I didn't have enough extra money lying around to go pay for another set w/o getting my money back from here first. So she got a picture and the gifting was not as exciting as it could have been. The only reason I waited so long was so she wouldn't see how much I had spent and spoil her surprise. Next time I will buy locally and just not have them bill me until the day of. Amazon did not listen and the worst part was getting the cookie cutter responses. I am hard pressed to believe they were read at all."
1,The size of these stones are just perfect! I have triple holes in my ears and these are placed in the second holes. They shine so brightly and catch attention. Worth every penney!
1,"This is a stunning necklace. It is small so don't expect a whopper of a stone. Rather, it is a delicate piece of jewelry, one that shines and really gets noticed whether it's around a bare neck or against a dark shirt. I wear mine every day and have gotten many, many compliments on it. A nice investment for a nice price."
1,"The earrings were a little larger than I expected, but they are very pretty and well crafted. My sensitive ears haven't had a reaction to the metal so I'm very satisfied."
1,"I purchased these to wear in a second piercing toward the back of my earlobes, but the post is mounted toward the top of the cross making it extend below the ear. At first, disappointed, I considered giving them away, but when I inserted them forward in my first piercing, they are so cute I decided to keep them. These were purchased with the heart earrings sold by the same vendor and look great worn together.These are not ""delicate"" crosses because the steel is a little chunky, but I think this will ensure long-lasting wearability. They are highly polished and very noticeable, though small."
1,My ears are sensitive to most metals so I find it difficult to find things that suit my style. These earrings are simply perfect. They came package well and shipped fairly quickly. Thanks so much! I shall purchase from this seller in the future.
1,"I bought these along with the 1/4 inch star studs from the same seller and they came 2 days earlier than the expected date which is awesome! Some reviewers said they were very long and sharp but for me, I don't think that's the case. I measured them with stud earrings from Claire's and they were the same size. They're very true to picture and size and are adorable. They're tiny so they go perfect with double or multiple piercings. The package said made in China though, so I suspect they won't last long even though they look brand new and sturdy, but for the price, it's well worth it. Awesome buy and seller."
1,"These are good quality studs that are just the right size. They are also stainless steel, so they are hypoallergenic. The backings are a little long and they did poke me a little when I lay down, but they were easily trimmed with a wirecutter."
0,"I bought these because I thought they would be perfect to just keep in my ears for days at a time. I have several peircings in each ear so its easiest to not have to take them out all the time... but these star points are EXTREMELY sharp, theres no way I could keep these in over night, I did once and woke up with red rings all around the earing...so I dont even bother wearing them..."
1,"I'm always worried that my jewelry will turn. This held its color. I really love it.It's solid, and not too thick. Very pretty.I'm complimented quite frequently when I wear it."
1,"This is a great necklace for a cheap price. I found that you can wear a variety of earrings with it and it looks great. I was pleased with my purchase, the packaging it came in, and would recommend it to anyone. As some other people said...it is a lighter weight piece but it is real silver and you would pay a much higher price for a heavy silver pendant. Buy it and enjoy!"
0,"I thought this pendant would be bigger and heavier, but it's so light it moves around on it's chain throughout the day. It's pretty, but not as nice as I expected. I don't think I'll be buying jewelry I can't try on beforehand anymore."
1,was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this pendant for the price. very comfortable to wear and not too heavy.
0,"The pendant is very pretty, but I admit I was a little surprised at how big it was (I didn't pay a lot of attention to the measurements). The diameter is a tad over an inch! The pendant itself has a very smooth finish so it does have a machined look rather than a crafted look, but it's still a lovely design.However, the chain, while it looks nice, is absolutely terrible if you have long hair as it catches and tangles hair very badly. Each little subunit of the chain flexes if it's curved (like it is around your neck), and your hair can get trapped in the gaps. I had to cut some hair to remove the necklace; it was tangled up that badly. Part of the price you pay includes the value of the chain, so this really reduces the value of the pendant."
1,My wife loves this pendant. The chain was rather thin so we replaced it but the pendant is a hit.
1,"I bought this necklace for my girlfriend for Christmas, but Christmas is in three days so she has yet to open it! Being a guy I don't have much sense in jewelry fashion, but I bought this necklace based on all of the rave reviews, and it was very nice on arrival. One thing that I liked"
1,"My wife usually wear gold jewelry, but I thought she might enjoy this piece and she does. She has worn it many many times since I gave it to her. It looks especially nice when worn against black. The best part? It's the most inexpensive piece of jewelry I've ever given her!"
1,"My daughter gave this pendant to me for Christmas a few years ago. I love it! It is beautifully made and it is the necklace I always chose when I'm wearing silver jewelry. I bought a longer chain (24"")-- much better look for the size of the pendant. I'm very picky about the jewelry I wear--I highly recommend this piece."
1,"This has become my new favorite. It's the perfect size pendant for me, and the chain length is just right too. It's sturdy and brilliant. Buying jewelry online has often led to disappointment for me, but this was one purchase that exceeded my expectations."
1,"This pendant is perfect - perfect size, perfect weight, etc. It is 1-1/8"" diameter & is beautifully detailed. If you are a fan of sterling silver, especially filigree, you will not be disappointed. I have received many compliments."
0,I expected a heavier piece. I don't think it is comparable to the cost. Service was excellent. xxx xxxx xxx
1,"This is an excellent value for a sterling silver pendant. Its size (about 1.25 inch in diameter) and circular filigree style looks great with ""business casual"" or ""social event"" attire."
1,"Nice, Large, Bright Silver and Thin sums it up.This is a nice filigree pendant and large enough to stand out which is what I was looking for. It is a very white silver. It's not as chunky as I would have liked but I can't seem to find one here on Amazon. In the stores, all I find are hearts, hearts and more hearts. This pendant is really, really pretty thin, I was surprised at how thin it was. Turn it sideways and it disappears. The small diameter snake chain is not quite as nice or feminine as I've seen, but it works.I have long hair and didn't find that my hair gets caught in it like some other reviewers mentioned, maybe I'm just more careful keeping my hair to the side when putting it on so that it doesn't get caught in the first place, don't know if this is it or not.All in all, a good value for the price if you want a large sterling silver pendant you can actually see on your neck."
1,Very nice pendant. I am not normally a fan of filigree but this piece is lovely! Would buy again!
1,"I purchased this necklace for a recent cruise. I wanted something simple yet elegant. After receiving the beautifully wrapped package, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and detailed design. After my return from vacation, I ordered one for my 18 year old daughter. I knew if she didn't have her own; mine would be missing. She loves it as much as I do!!!!"
1,i got this for christmas and it is BEAUTiFUL!. i got compliments from all of my friends. the chain is very sturdy also. you should buy this for yourself or anyone. it's a GREAT gift!
1,The blue topaz trillion in these earrings are bright and blue. The setting is gorgeous and shiny.
1,"I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! Love love love them!"
0,"Discolouration kicks in very quickly, and you're left with a yellowish barbell. I never really noticed anything ""glow in the dark"" about it. It's nothing special, so don't waste your time, unless you're really tired of your solid colour barbell."
0,"Something safer on my teeth than steel, but wanted the look of steel in my mouth.. So the picture of this barbell is VERY inaccurate. I was expecting very condensed glitter for a completely silver look.. The silver is very much spaced out and awkward looking.. Clear beads with very little glitter..The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the acrylic flexible nature IS comfortable."
1,I had a bracelet very similiar to this one and lost it. I really liked my bracelet and waited for a similiar bracelet to appear for sale elsewhere. I am glad that it finally did. I love it. Thanks.
0,This boat is quite small and light weight and only has detail on one side. I am a bit disappointed in it since it looks like it should be more 3D in the picture. It will be OK on my charm bracelet though.
0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, but it is not for men. Too small, too effeminate."
1,Makes my night stand very clean. The color matches my furniture very well. We are looking for a similar but bigger version for the wife..
1,"Does not look cheap at all. Very pleased to get this box for the price. Comfortably fits my 2 watches, 2 necklaces, wallet and money clip. definitely recommend for a good cheap jewelry box"
1,I brought this product for three men in my family. They all loved the look and features of the item..
0,"I ordered this to see if it would be fitting to display some of our products at our office. It ended up being to small for what we needed, so i returned it and received less than half of what i paid for it. I paid around $65 and was refunded around $27. Not happy about that.Not only that, but when i wrote and email asking why I only received a partial refund, they were rude in their response."
1,I love this for a travel jewelry case. My husband puts his watches in and I put my bracelets. Perfect size
0,"I love artsy, interesting, non-mainstream jewelry, and this fits the bill. However, this piece is too weird to wear. The pin is designed so the enameled ""back"" of the ladybug (although I'm convinced it's a ""misterbug"" it's facial features are masculine), faces forward, this would be ok, as it is the enameled and colorful part of the pin - however there is a big hole going through misterbug's head - meant for a necklace or cord. So when you wear it as a necklace, the pin is facing forward. Not the best design, as no matter how you wear it, it looks like it might be on backwards."
1,"I ordered this ring as a backup while my wedding ring was being repaired. It looked very similar to the real one. It was a bit too big (ordered a size 5, fit more like a 6), but it looked great and did not make my finger turn green :) Overall, very satisfied."
0,It doesn't turn my finger green. Some days the gem looks really fake. But some days it doesn't. Maybe it's a humidity thing.
0,"I was pleased on the date of shipping and how it was shipped. It arrived in the standard UPS box with a heart shaped gift box to hold the ring. Shortly after giving the ring to my girlfriend, the ring started turning her finger green. I guess you get what you pay for, eh? Still pleased with the ring and the price. 3 stars."
1,"the ring arrived two days after it was supposed to arrive, but the ring is in excellent condition and it comes with a little cute blue jewellery box.i ordered a size 6, and it fits my finger perfectly. i love it. definitely will buy more stuff from Gem Avenue.recommend to everyone!"
1,"nice for everyday wear or just special occassions,reasonable price for such a beautiful ring"
1,"This ring is lovely, simple and elegant. Very high quality for the price. I bought it for myself just because it was pretty, and received compliments on it the first day I wore it. Arrived within four days."
1,"Of course, I got these earrings for myself, and was fearful that they were [...]. Well, when I got them It was love at first sight. The silver shined brightly, and the crystal wasn't has small as I thought. There not huge, but not so tiny that no one could notice them. There very light weight and I have sensitive ears and these earrings give me no problems whatsoever. If your looking to suprise a loved one with a pair of beautiful earrings, I suggest these."
0,"I have had two of these rings. The first ring completly lost the stone. The second chipped. I teach, so I do not think I am being overly rough on the product. I think it isn't made well, although it is very pretty."
1,"Love, love love, this toe ring, I wear it every day. Feels and looks good."
1,This toe ring is adorable. I get tons of compliments on my toe ring and love wearing sandles to show it off.
0,"My disappointment was with the width of the bracelet, it seem to be for a small or young child an item with that kind of detail and for the price should have a little more in width so it can be seen.LB"
0,"I bought this about 9 months ago, and now it appears the pendant has started chipping at the surface, leaving black underneath. It is definitely not made of sterling silver as the listing says. Amazon refused my request for a refund."
0,"I thought this pendant was adorable when I purchased it however when I received it, I was disappointed. The top heart does not sit flat on you, it flops to the side which makes it impossible to actually see the heart. The chain is a very poor quality and will probably break quickly. I just packaged it up and am returning it."
1,The item came within a week and it is prettier than the picture. Great buy
1,"This is an absolutely beautiful piece! I purchased this with the matching earrings, and I was extremely pleased. For the price, you absolutely can not go wrong! It is larger than I aniticipated and looks stunning on my 16 inch snake chain."
1,"I reviewed this item shortly I received it, and was disappointed because chemicals in the pool seemed to turn the Angel ring black... Well, I must say that after some time, the ""black"" disappeared and the ring is once again as beautiful as it was when I received it. I wear it all the time, but not in the pool!"
1,The charm was just perfect for our track star granddaughter. She has asked for this charm for several years and I could not find excatly what she wanted....now I have and it is just the perfect size for her to wear on a necklace.....
1,For the little princess in your life. Quality craftsmanship and beautiful pieces of jewelry. I bought these for a friends one year old. These are not going to fall apart if they are yanked on and the necklace was small enough so that it didn't hang down and cause a choking hazard. Great keepsake pieces. Thanks!
0,This jewlery set looks like jewlery one could purchase at a Dollar Store. Very poor quality. I send it back to the seller as soon as I received it.
1,These earrings have been a big hit. My wife has recieved many compliments and as a result the earrings get lots of use. A great value for the price.
1,"This bracelet looks great and the price is right. I have a skinny wrist, so I needed a bracelet that was adjustable, theres only a few on here that are adjustable and this one was the nicest. It was very easy to adjust with the right tool, I used a flat head from a watch repair kit. The pins snap into place after you've taken out a piece."
0,"Being into the world of metal, this thing was quite neat looking on the site. Once it was opened and taken out of the box is another thing. I think I was hoping for just a plain polished stainless steel piece, what I got was a stainless steel piece with a chrome or silver plating. The plating makes the links of this thing hard to move. I find that it binds up alot especially in the center. I gave it 3 stars cause of the plating and overall look of it. I was hoping for a rugged looking chunk of chain and what I got was a quirky lil ornamental thing.Not amazons fault nor the fault of the seller, I should have looked a lil better at what I was buying. Overall, nice piece just not what I was expecting. I kept it though and do wear it."
0,"I live outside US I ordered the item to be shipped to freight forwarder address and re-send it to me. I ordered the yellow gold Y charm and got white one instead. I contactated Amazon 3 times mentioning this situation.1. The first one I explained the situation but gave them the wrong order number (my mistake). The cust. service agent asked me to contact the seller without reading through my explanatory notes.In the mean time I submitted feedback about the misleading image on yellow gold but reality was they were sending white gold instead.2. I contacted them the second time with the right order number this time. The agent asked me to send it back for a replacement. He didn't read throught my notes neither, since I explained I live outside the US.3. The third contact"
1,"after coming home from an amazing cruise on the seabourn odyssey, i knew i HAD to get a cruiseship charm. this charm is absolutely beautiful and looks exactly like it does in the pictures!"
1,I saw this item featured on [...]with other great pieces of Jack Russell jewelry. This item is great. The picture doesn't give it justice. I bought one for my wife because of our JRT trixie and she loved it. This is a quality piece of jewelry.
0,"No part of the gold shines. I don't expect rose gold to shine but neither the yellow gold nor the white gold shine either. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't do it."
0,This is a simple beaded bracelet. Nice stretch. Casual and young. Dont like tags on such bracelets. Have to be clipped off and afraid of cutting the bracelet.
0,"These earrings are very cute, however they are not super high quality. I feel like I will break them pulling the back off the earring."
1,"These are great little earrings. Modest, neat. The backings fit snugly, so the sign stays in place. A charmingly appropriate statement."
0,"I really love these, and so do my boyfriend. They are really cute, don't irritate my ears, and add class to all of my outfits. The problem is, they come off. You have to make sure the backs are on tight. A few days ago, I woke up and one of them had come off. Since they are so small, they are hard to find. I still haven't found one."
1,"These are beautiful and well made earrings. I would definitely recommend, especially if you like the two-tone gold look!"
0,Beautiful silver Daisy but the earring latch turns so you see the back of the earring rather than front. Kinda sticks out... I attached the earring to a French Hook and it lays nicer but looks a little rigged.
0,"These earrings are so pretty, but they are just a tad too long to sit on my ear correctly. They sit against the rim of cartilage above my earlobe holes and sit crooked. Not sure if I just have small ears or if others have this problem. I wish they were a couple of mm smaller, then they'd be perfect."
0,Very cute belly ring but is uncomfortable for me when the top of the lock pinches my skin.
0,The stone is way more yellow and less November birthstone in real life. I never wear it because it's just not that pretty in real life.
1,"I ordered this ring on the 6th of March, I got it today on the 11th. I bought this as a gift for my mother, it is beautiful, the lavender and marcasite really clash together well, the result being a unique ring that you won't really find in stores. I love this ring, as did the recipient, it definitely looks more expensive than what it cost."
1,"This marcasite and lavender ring is a beauty. The colors are a lovely combination. The lavender is unusually beautiful and has many shades and colors within it. This ring can be worn two ways, pointing up or down, which makes it even more special. I doubt you'll run into anyone with a ring like this. It's much more beautiful in person and very well made. I highly recommend it!"
1,"I am very happy with the Lord's Prayer bracelet. I recommend buying them for almost anyone for no reason or a special occasion, such as Confirmation, First Communion or any spiritual occasion."
1,"My wife is a big supporter of breast cancer prevention. She really enjoys this necklace, and the quality is very good. I bought it through Amazon, but it came from Littman Jewelers, so she is able to have it inspected and cleaned locally for free. White Gold and stones are very nice. Stones are a good shade of pink."
0,I bought these for my wife for Christmas. The quality of cut was good the color acceptable for the price and any inclusions were very minimal for diamonds to be worn on the ear. However the back (Clasp) of the earring is cheaply made and lose fitting. My wife claimed that as her only concern with the gift and this proved to be prophetic as they did not last a week before one fell off her ear over the course of a day of traveling. This crucial detail turned a very satisfying purchase into a very dissatisfying one!
0,these earrings had a massive flaw in one of them that could be easily noticed.
1,This is a lovely cross necklace. The service from Fred Meyer Jewelers was VERY fast. Good value for the money. I would buy from them again.
1,"More than I expected, what fun. I showed several people and they want their own."
0,"This is a great necklace and comes in nice packaging, perfect for gifts. The downfall is that the necklace chain came to me in knots that I haven't been able to completely undo."
1,"I am very pleased with this ring. The ""ruby"" is just the right size; not too big or too small. The ring has a lot of sparkle to it and it looks elegant. The silver in the ring is substantial and the setting is unique. A very pretty ring!"
0,The first day I wore it one of the balls was lost. It must have fallen off during the day and I didn't notice. Now I cannot wear it anymore
1,"THE SHAPE OF THESE EARRINGS IS NOT ONLY ATTRACTIVE BUT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE.I WOULD BUY MORE EARRINGS WITH THIS SHAPE BUT ""OTHER DANGLES"" IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE.I GET BORED EASILY BUT THESE ARE ONES I WEAR AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND TRULY LOVE."
1,"I bought these earrings for my neice, and she loves them. They are simply beautiful."
1,These earrings are beautiful. They're large without being annoying and very attention getting. Love them.
1,I just love these earrings. I bought them three years ago and have been waring them almost every day since then. It's so rare that I love something that much.
1,LOVE this pin! I purchased it as a gift for my sister but think I want one for myself!! Nicely done and worth the cost for something so unique.
1,I bought this for my brother in law; the fancy attorney who is hard to buy for. He loved them!!!
0,"Worn two days, lost all of it's stones. Worst thing I ever bought. Don't buy one ever! Was not good!"
1,My husband is using this ring as his wedding ring (I got the one with the blue inlay). He loves it. He says it's lightweight and fits very well.
0,"I was looking for another vendor beside Macy's on Amazon to buy this piece. I ended up getting it at KJ at my local mall. This gothic cross design has a mirror backdrop with a brushed stainless steel matte finish on the second level of the cross. The very top cross has some diamonds place within the design. On the back of the cross, it has an large S in old English font, which works out well for me since S is in my name.I looked at the other designs and this Gothic cross design was the best. It is really heavy and people will come up to you and ask can I feel it. The mirror stainless finish makes it shine. The diamonds are also bright in the sun and store department lights.The warranty on this piece is lifetime, all you have to do is have it looked at by a jeweler who is licensed to sell Russell Simmons Stainless jewerly.One word of advice on this piece. It is mirror finished Stainless, so it will and shows scratches. If you use an stainless shine cloth with a cleaner you can null and shine past those scratches."
1,"I really like this product. It sparkles! Really, the 'gems' are very nice and don't have the dull look of plastic."
0,"I was not very impressed with this order. Received earrings in a little velet bag with ""Made in China"" on it. Color was not great, but OK, however the Clarity was poor. I checked and these are even a poor I3 for clarity. Was a late Christmas order so I did not have time to do anything else."
0,"The necklace lasted a week and then the rubber broke near the clasp. I guess in life you get what you pay for, not what is advertised."
1,"Wonderful necklace, great price and value. Very recommended! This is my third purchase, I have never been disappointed."
1,I LOVE this ring. The colors and vibrancy are perfect. Pink is my favorite color! It is slim. I wear it on my middle finger with a ring on my ring finger also. So it is perfect for using with multiple rings.
0,"Where to begin? I was trying to be a good husband, buying my wife a pair of diamond studs for her birthday. She teaches, and instructed that she didn't want anything expensive, as she expected to lose one or both of the earrings within the year. I shopped around and settled on these 1/3 carat earrings from Netaya.The folks at Netaya deserve some kudos here - their photography skills are outstanding, and their customer service folks are very efficient at putting customers on hold.The earrings arrived a week late, even with the express shipping that I paid an extra $10 for (not UPS's fault, they weren't shipped for 6 days). Imagine my surprise when I opened the box (a necklace box, about 3""x5"", ie huge) to find two of the dreariest looking yellow diamond earrings I'd ever seen.Not a great birthday when she wouldn't even take them out of the box. She promptly asked where I'd gotten them, and what the return policy was like.I called Netaya that afternoon, went through the customer service menus, and spoke to several CSRs, all of whom seemed surprised that I expected a refund of my purchase price, plus the shipping price (I paid for expedited shipping, it wasn't expedited, figured it was fair to ask for it back)To their credit, the little dreary looking earrings went back at their expense, and I was credited two weeks later with my full purchase price and shipping expense.I guess next time I'm sent for cheap earrings, I'll go to Walmart..."
0,"The diamonds were quite yellow, so much that I debated whether to give them to my wife, and she visibly debated taking them. I don't think I'll buy jewelry from Amazon again, just because I have no way to see what I'm getting until the day it arrives."
1,"Great price, great quality. They made me a hero with my wife, even if it was only for a day. Does any husband get more credit than one day?"
0,One of the earrings had a very large carbon spot just under the surface of the top of the stone. Visible from 20 feet away on a 3/8 of a carrot stud.
1,"My wife was very pleased with this ring,looked like it was worth more than it cost. Everyone had nothing but nice things to say about the ring."
0,"Got this ring as a gift, the stone looks much darker than the picture(almost black) and the setting looks a bit costume jewelryish."
1,just love it! the quilty is very good and it is very durbale (sorry for the spelling)
1,"I purchased the ring and matching earrings and am very pleased with the quality of the stones and the workmanship, highly recommend."
1,I am wearing this ring all the time. It's pretty. It arrived quickly. I'm pleased with the service.
1,"I ordered this Celtic knot ring with a sapphire. It was beautiful, the price was incredible and the service was super-fast.I strongly recommend this product and seller!"
1,This ring was everything I hoped for. Lovely color and no flaws in the silver design. I have several colors of this ring that i got for half the price. This is definitely a higher quality metal.
1,This ring is the perfect size. I love the celtic knot design. The sapphire is a beautiful shade of royal blue. I can count on your company for quality. Have ordered from you before and will again
1,"I waited a month and a half to post this review to make sure the quality of my ring upheld. It has! In my experiences with this product, the silver did NOT tarnish or turn your finger green (and I have fairly sensitive skin) as stated in another review. The stone is a perfect deep blue that sparkles nicely in the sun. The silver band does NOT easily warp or bend or scratch with daily wear (and I've worn this ring non-stop since I got it). I get many comments on how beautiful the ring is.I bought this ring under the impression that for the cheap price of it even if it was a lab grown stone, or even if it wasn't the exact correct color or the silver tarnished or bent easily that I was simply getting what I was paying for. But this ring has surprised me and is now my favorite ring! It's a great product. Give it a try but if you experience the problems that others have had, remember how little you paid for it."
1,"By the way it looks in the picture i thought it would look a little cheap, but when i received the ring i realized it looks so elegant, the sterling silver looks very polished and shiny, and the sapphire does look blue and shines a lot, it was a gift for my mom and she loves it, the only thing is that the ring size chart is a little bit misleading, my mom ordered a ring size 10, after we printed the chart and used it, but it's too big for her, in the picture it looks like the ring is adjustable, but its not, i fixed it with a tool so she can wear the ring now, but overall Amazon.com was very fast in sending me the ring and also the ring looks very elegant and shiny."
1,"Blue Sapphire is awesome for the price, Ring has to be worn only in Middle finder.This stone (Blue sapphire) as great gem....As per the old literature of Indian Vedic astrology (the oldest and genuine form of astrolgy).....it is highly powerfull stone and can term to be Auspicious as well as In-Auspicious....this depend on how good the Saturn is for your chart as per vedic astrology.Since most of them of are un-aware of vedic astrolgy science....I would recomend you to BUY it, BUT if you find any un-usual happening after wearing this ring then....it is likely that this stone is either of inferior quality or Saturn is not good for your chart as per vedic astrology. In that case you should aviod wearing it.Note:- this gem has to be worn only in Middle finder and It can be highly in-auspicious if worn in other fingers (Saturn is highly conservative strongest of Inaspecious planet....anything againt it is can prove worst for you). Preferably try to wear this ring on Saturday or Friday or Wednesday (Saturday is best).....as blue sapphire is a gem stone of Saturn as per vedic astrology.Hope you belive the vedic science...rest is upto u to decide."
1,"This ring is not too small, not too big, just perfect. The stone is clear and the fit is divine. Very smooth and comfortable. I also have it in the topaz. Great ring for everyday wear."
1,"I bought this ring for my daughter for her birthday. It is beautiful and she loves the ring. I was completely satisfied with the purchase and delivery of the product. I would recommend this way of buying to others. It was easy, accurate and timely."
1,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. She absolutlely loves the ring. It's just as pictured. This was my first time buying from this company and I will probably buy from them again
0,"The ring arrived in good time & looked great, but unfortunately the band/shank bent the first time I wore it - so I've obviously wasted my money."
1,I am happy to say that the pictures do not do this beauty justice. It looks like an antique family piece worth far more than $44.00! The filigree is very dainty. I know it is just a CZ but it does not look cheap. So glad I took a chance on it. *jumps up and down*
1,"Of all the cuff links I own, I wear these the most! They look stunning years later and what a bargain!"
1,Very pretty colors and an especially brilliant shade of blue. If you like to collect cufflinks as I do--get em!
1,The sizing is a little snug but the ring looks just like the picture. It is flattering for long fingers.
0,"I don't like that product at all.1 it doesn't look good in real live, because the product is very poorly made and is made out of cheap material.2 It seems like a new interesting Design, but if u have a flat belly the two plastic-balls will hang facing downward of your belly.3 it's not like the other Piercings where u can choose you mm length and as expected the metal loop is way to long.4 It's easy to break, it got a little crack all ready when i first screwed it open. Then if you closed it it will re-open, but if u screw it so hard together that that doesn't happen it will break.5 This Design gets easy stuck on cloth etc. so it's easy to hurt u.I had belly Button Rings for 7 years and i have to say that hole Rings with a click-ball and the standard Design are the most comfortable to wear and u cant hurt your self by getting caught on your cloth and they don't fall out easy and don't break usually.The ones which have a big rounding like a sun around the belly button look good on pictures but never when you wear them. On thin people they stick out on people with more fat they kind of mash in. And they are soooooooo uncomfortable especially when you sit. And they Stick out of your T-shirt etc.The ones with the hanging jewelery look very nice but can break easy if made poorly and i would just get ones with round hanging ends so they don't rip on the towel ofter showering or cloth.So i hope i could help you :)"
1,These earrings are a standout! They add just the right amount of bling.And the price was excellent. Thank you for your speedy delivery and care in packaging. Will definitely order from you again.
1,"I love this bracelet, it matches a byzantine necklace that I had purchased previously on Amazon some years ago, it is sturdy and I have to take it off sense receiving it. It was sent in a timely manner and the service was great."
0,"I thought it was too small. People have to get in your face before they can see all the beautiful detail. That is my only complaint about it. It is very pretty, but just too small. I think it would of been nicer if it were bigger, but I still like it & still will wear it."
1,"OK, the ring was a HUGE hit! The intended recipient of the wonderful piece of jewelery, my girlfriend, has already named it and its name is ""Magnifico"". It was a nickname of Lord Medici, the archduke of Milan and I have to tell you that it doesn't take a huge stretch of imagination to picture it on his hand. A wonderful ring with so many layers of visual beauty, a perfect gift for a person that has your life in her gentle hands, and a great way to usher someone into a realm of fantasy. TOP MARKS!I only have one small complaint, not with the ring itself, but with the marketing part. The photos of the ring (and every other piece of jewelery by Silver Insanity btw.) do not do them justice. I think you should strongly reconsider creating some new, more detailed, pictures of them under various lighting and preferably while someone is wearing them.I'm looking forward to ordering more of your fabulous products!"
1,This is a very beautiful necklace and I get wonderful comments on it all of the time!
1,Once again I am please by a purchase I made from cuff-daddy through amazon. These are stunning and wears nicely against my white shirts. I am use to people complimenting my cufflinks everytime I get new ones from cuff-daddy and these were no different.These are nice vivid greens set against the backdrop of nicely polished silver.Cant go wrong with these as a gift or for self
1,"I recently purchased this locket with a peridot stone. I cannot express how pleased I am with this purchase! Although I was reluctant to pay a premium price for a sterling and semi-precious locket, the craftsmanship is marvelous and the chain by itself would cost $25.00 or more in any jewelry shop.This is truly an heirloom quality piece. Again, I am so happy I went again and purchased a locket by Anatoli... it makes everything look cheap and silly by comparison."
1,"Mother needed a large size cross with a fine design to hang around her neck. This is a beautiful large size cross, no cheap junk. Mother loved it. Mother is happy so I am happy, end of the story!"
1,This ring is perfect. Just like the picture. The fit is good and the ring is very nice and shiny.
1,"Bought this almost three years ago and it still looks great, fits perfectly and just the right width personally for me since i did not want a very large band. Sits nicely against my engagement ring, I've never had any problems with it pinching. Very happy to this day about this purchase, great price and a great product"
1,I bought these for a special friends birthday.She loves them.They go well with casual or dressy clothes.For the office or party.They shine beautifully in reflected light.This is the second pair of Akoya pearl earrings I have bought from Augustina Jewelry and will not hesitate to buy a third pair for myself.
1,"I bought this pendant for my daughter-in-law, as a Christmas gift. She loves dragons, and her birthday is in July, so the red stone was ideal for her too. She loved it! Thanks for the great idea, Amazon, it's a beautiful piece."
1,They are beautiful and of excellent quality. My niece has the Tiffany Starfish necklace and these earings will match it perfectly. I can't want to see her reaction when she opens the box Christmas morning! Thank you for having these available through Amazon.com.
1,"I think these earrings are very cute. Look great with the matching necklace! Would highly recommend, good quality."
1,Good Quality silver stud earrings. Bought the pendant for my sister. She enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying her the earrings to match (bought myself a pair too!). Eve's Addiction (the seller) were really great in correcting the order when a mistake was made. Would buy from them again.
1,"I've been looking for a Lapis ring and when I saw this one I jumped on it. An excellent value for the price at around $22. Love the marquis shape, nice size for a middle finger ring, and the Lapis stone is very pretty. Also made in USA."
1,"Pugster Silver Cat SilhouetteVery cute and stylish silver cat belly ring, features a diamond-look collar. Great quality at a reasonable price. Higly recommend Pugster for quick shipping and great product packaging."
1,"rec the ring sooner then i was told and it was packaged in such a way nothing short of a steam roller could have damaged it. looked just like the picture, and my husband loved it!!"
1,This is a beautiful and affordable piece of jewellery. It looks a lot better in real life the photo doesn't do it justice. Comes with chain as mentioned in other reviews.Delivery was faster than the estimated time also which was great.Overall a very pretty locket.
1,"As the title says, its a nice ring. I like tension set rings, but I have been looking for some with colored stones. This one was very nicely done and the stone is a beautiful red color. I was pleased with the ring and the fast shipping. JVargas"
1,We purchased the Chain for our son for Christmas. It was a hit with him! He hasn't taken it off since Christmas morning. The chain is very well made and looks great.
1,This chain came very quickly and is of a very nice quality and craftsmanship. It was a bit long and too thin for my taste though. Thankfully Gem Avenue has a great return policy and was very understanding. I would myself and highly recommend this vendor to anyone looking for a nice piece of jewelry
1,This item is very nice i ordered the 30 Inch and it came out just as i expected and it is new and shiny.
1,"Hola, no hablo ingles nada, solo espa&ntilde;ol, bueno de mas esta decir que todo fue excelente, como la entrega de la cadena como la calidad de la calidad, saludos desde veenzuela"
1,"The Sterling Silver Curb Cuban Link 4mm Italian 18"" neckless is very attractive and well made. I will definitely order more from Gem. Service was great and the product was received when promised and in good condition. Definitely a five star company."
1,"The picture on this product really doesn't do it justice. The chain is sturdy, has a nice weight to it and it's more elegant than boxy. The silver is very bright. If I were writing ad copy I'd say this chain was the perfect combination of masculinity and style.My husband was wanting a chain he could hang his wedding ring on while he was working and not worry about chain breaking/losing the ring. He also didn't want a chain he would have to fuss with if it didn't lay flat. We've both seen chains when a lot of wear ""kinks the links"". It was a tall order but the moment I saw this chain I thought it might be the one. When I received it, I realized I'd made a good choice.Husband really loved it when he opened it. He wears it all the time - even showering with it on - and it's holding up perfectly.I was very, very pleased with the quality of this product, the price, quick turnaround on shipping and packaged nicely (in a small jewel box but also in a ziploc pouch in the box).Based on my experience I would definitely recommend this vendor in general and definitely this product in particular."
1,"I bought this chain with a little fear that I might not like it, but really it's perfect. THe only flaw is that it's too short for me, but I'm not going to substract a star because obviously it was my fault because I didn't imagine the length right.Overall...see it, buy it..."
1,"I bought this chain for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it looks GREAT on him. I was afraid it might be too short, but it is the perfect length and the color is beautiful! My boyfriend loves it, and hasn't taken it off since I gave it to him."
1,"I bought this chain to replace one of my wife's broken chain. I gave it to her as a small gift around the holiday season. When my wife opened it and tried it on, I was very surprise by the quality. She absolutely loves it and wears it everyday. She was going to use the charm from her previous chain but just left it alone by itself. I am very happy with this little chain and so is my wife. I would recommend it to anyone. You'll be very please with it."
1,"Got the 24 in, and its has nice wt for a 4 mm, and fits my star of david pendant perfectly.I shower in mine, so I have had no problem with the clasp breaking as some say happens. Its jewelry, you got to treat it gentle. Just what I was looking for. Would buy again."
1,"I really like this chain. It is very comfortable, doesn't tangle easily, has a secure clasp and looks great. It would make a great gift. I will be ordering more at various lengths as the chain will compliment several necklaces I already have. Amy"
1,I make my own jewelry and own many pendants so it is hard to find what i want in a high quality....Well i found it and i am very pleased and plan on getting many more in a bunch of lengths so thank-you for the quality.
1,"Every once in a while, you find finely crafted silver-work at a ridiculously low price and Gem Avenue is one of those rare finds. I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case. The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no ""play"" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels ""expensive"" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door). The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no ""hanging"".I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th"" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time. I know, I swallowed my tongue, too. But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom. Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business. We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that. Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite ""seat"" properly or fail altogether. Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn. These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show. And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry. Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased. Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains? Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking. When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and ""through the grapevine.You will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here. Always a fine experience.Very Best Regards,Cycat"
0,"This chain is pretty, but it wasn't as thick or as long as pictured. I have to purchase another one, but from somewhere else."
1,"A chain for a necklace I had broke and this was the perfect replacement, the size/length is perfect and it is very durable but still pretty."
1,"Had this chain for a bit over a week now and so far it has proven it's sturdiness and quality....I use it daily, including to the gym, and it has kept the same condition that I first got it in."
1,"I would highly recommend this chain. It's well polished, sturdy, and has a smooth finish that feels nice against the skin and perfect for a favorite pendant."
1,"Just purchased eight of the necklaces for silver & glass pendants I created in a jewelry class. Three chains are 1MM for the lighter pendants, five are 1.5MM. I mistakenly purchased 16"" chains first, then returned them for 18"". The necklaces are very high quality as noted in the other reviews. Even the finer chains feel strong and solid. I am very pleased with the purchase and the return for longer chains was easy and prompt. I will definitely buy from these people again. They're gems!"
1,"i broke my gfs necklace trying to unknot it,i found this necklace as a replacement and now the pendant really shines with this necklace."
1,I love this chain it shines like diamondsIt is bright and beautifulAnd got here so quickly.Just like everything else I have ordered
0,"The necklace is nice but its a lot smaller than i expected. The clasp is also really tiny and sticks sometimes, so I replaced it."
1,"This is a beautiful chain, especially for the cost. It is perfect for my birthstone charms. Very satisfied with this purchase!"
1,Chain is beautiful in person. The picture does not give it justice. All good experiences with this seller!
1,"These chains are lovely and an excellent value. I bought them to replace the base metal chain that come with a religious medal. It is a nice, strong chain. Thanks!"
1,I got this for my mom for Christmas and she loved it! I've order jewelry from this company before and they never disapoint!!
1,"I have been looking all over for silver necklace chains and could not find anything that would good enough. So I decided to explore on Amazon and came across these. As soon as I saw these and read the reviews from other customers, I knew they would be perfect!! I just bought the charm part (a break in half big sis lil sis) of a necklace for my little sister who turns 12 next month so I was in need of getting necklace chains. I received them in the expected arrival due date, in perfect condition! I would GREATLY recommend this chain to any other individual who is looking to purchase a chain. I could not ask for anything better! Thank you!!"
1,I ordered this chain to hold my ankh pendant and it's perfect. Not too thin or too bulky.It hangs perfectly. I ordered the 24 in. It looks beautiful with my ankh cross. I wear it everyday.
1,"I was very surprized when I recieved this chain, it was exactly what I wanted, will definately buy another."
1,This is the perfect addition to your jewelry box. Wear alone or with any kind of pendant. The box link is a very sturdy chain. Economical and beautiful!
1,"This necklace is great. I bought a 30 inch necklace and it was really nice and if you want a real long necklace, this fits the bill. Real shiney and nice."
1,It fit me perfectively!!It arrived in excellent condition.it was light and comfortable and I've worn it everyday!!!Thanks amazon and I will buy again
1,"I don't know anything about jewelry, but I bought this for my girlfriend because the chain broke on her necklace. The quality of this chain seems to be very good, and most importantly, she likes it."
1,"I bought my wife a cross pendant for Christmas that came with an 18&#34; chain...it didn't allow the cross to hang low enough, so we purchased this 24&#34; chain and it is perfect. Matches the cross well and is very elegant."
1,i got the item on time and when i open the box i was not disappointed. i like that its not too thin. i think its durable and would last long. so happy with my purchase
0,This chain broke like a toothpick in 2 months of light wear. Not at all recommended.
1,This is a beautiful necklace. My 14-year old wears it with a charm all the time; its very sturdy and a great value for the price. It goes very well with any type of charm; very very pleased with this piece.
1,"I absolutely love this chain, and am extremely pleased with it. I also am pleased with the very fast and excellent service I received. I intend to buy more of these chains, for some pendants I have. They are an excellent buy!!"
1,"I needed a nice, inexpensive chain for a charm I received. This chain was beautiful and very sturdy. I was very pleased with every aspect of the chain."
1,"The chains were for my grand daughters, so I'm very picky about the quality. They don't contain the harmful chemicals that are found in the extremely cheap chains, so I know their health will not be put in jeopardy. The quality of these chains is excellent! They are strong and very beautiful! My grand daughters had some charms they wanted to wear and these chains are perfect! I will definitely purchase these chains again when needed!"
1,"When I ordered this chain, I wasn't really expecting much. I just needed a good silver chain to wear with my silver pendants. When I got it, it was such a glistening beautiful chain, that I wear it will all of my silver pendants. I'm planning on ordering the same chain in several lengths. It well exceeded my expectations."
1,I was looking for a chain for a charm that I bought for my granddaughter. This one was exactly what I was looking for. It was very pretty and durable. I would buy this again.
1,These necklaces are durable and very pretty. Amazing price and exactly as advertised. Would definitely buy from here again.
1,Necklaces were as described and arrived within the time period. Would purchase from this vendor again.
1,The chain was lovely and has a very good clasp on it. Was very pleased with the quality.
1,"This is a great little chain. I bought 3. 2 for my daughters and one for me, unfortunately I gave one to my sister now I have to order another one. :)I got the 18 inch length which worked out perfect for the pendants I put on them. Lovely chain."
1,"Delicate but perfect for lighter weight pendants. Everything, including delivery date was as advertized."
1,"I found the quality of the chain to be better than I had expected due to the affordable price. It's very elegant and classy. I would recommend this product to anyone, just be wary of the size, might not fit someone with large proportions"
1,"This is a great chain, looks great, feels great, looks/feels high quality. The clasp is small so it is a bit hard but the nice thing is you can simply put a pendent on of any size."
1,I received that product as stated in the description within four days. The chain itself is very sturdy and looks fantastic. It was perfect for hanging a charm I had purchased for a friend. The clasp is strong and I would definitely recommend buying from Gem Avenue. I would make this purchase again.
1,This was a great price for a great necklace. Stayed just as it was delivered. I would definitely recommend this product!
1,"Ordered a 16"" chain and very happy with it. It's very thick and nice looking, definitely worth the price."
1,"I ordered this chain to specifically use with a very beautiful sterling silver cross. I was very pleased when I received it as it matched so closely with the cross you would swear it came with it. It is made very well, the clasp is responsive and easy to open and close. I am extremely happy with it and recommend it highly. It can be worn alone, with other chains or, as I have done, worn with a very special cross, religious medal or other sterling silver pendants."
1,I bought two of these chains and couldn't be more pleased. They are beautiful in quality and they were shipped delicately and quickly. This amazon seller is outstanding. A pleasure to do business with. I would recommend to anyone needing to make a jewelry purchase to do so with this seller.
1,I was worried about ordering this online but had a great experience with a gold chain so went ahead. this necklace is beautiful and excellent quality. Much nicer than anything I saw in the stores for twice the price. Quick shipping.
0,"I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday. The chain itself (not the clasp) broke within a few hours. I don't know if it was a fluke or something, but she has been wearing one of my similar chains for two months and it is fine."
1,"A nice quality little chain, perfect for a light pendant. It will hold heaver stuff, but I think the 1MM is better for the lighter, smaller stuff. Just my opinion."
1,I love this chain! It is the perfect lenth and I love the box look. It is exactly what I wanted! Thanks!
1,I bought this chain for my mom for mothers day and she loved it! The chain looks very nice and goes great with her charms.
1,I was extremely pleased with the sterling silver chain I purchased. It was exactly what I wanted. Thank you.
1,The chain is very good quality. I like that it comes in a little gift box and in a little clear bag to protect the chain. And it's the perfect length.
1,"This silver chain is a surprising value. It is well-made, good quality, and very elegant on your neck."
1,"This chain is very nice, strong and very servicable for most pendants. I needed a shorter one to wear with open necked tops and it does the job. I have many pendants but all my chains are long. Thank you."
1,Was very pleased with this necklace. It was exactly what I wanted. In fact I plan to order another one in a different length.Received very fast...would order from again.
1,After buying this necklace I tried this on myself and found the ease it has of sliding it on and off when I need to do so. This necklace well designed and has real class. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of a necklace.
1,"I ordered this chain for my 10 year old niece. I already had a pendant. OMG! She loves, loves, loves it. It's very sparkly. She wears it all the time. It's very sturdy. Great Product. Thanks."
1,"I received my necklace today as a gift to myself. It came properly packaged and the service was excellent. To my surprise this necklace looks dainty and sparkly, but undeniably strong at the same time. I will be buying different lengths of this 1MM Italian box style and putting charms on them. I got the 30"" and it fits perfectly. Beautiful indeed, I highly recommend such an excellent deal on very fine silver."
1,"This chain was exactly what I was looking for--simple, pretty, thin enough for a pendant but not so thin I will have to worry constantly about breakage. It is lovely! I'm very pleased."
1,Absolutely love it. I gave this necklace away to a friend and wanted another one just like it. It's much stronger than typical chains and I love the look - not so girly/delicate. I wear it with a couple different pendants and a ring. Highly recommended!
1,Recieved this lovely little chain and it was just what I wanted. I ordered the 14 inch chain for my grandaughter and it will be perfect for her little charm. Seems to be sturdy and durable but feminine. Would recommend it to everyone!
1,"I gave this chain to my girlfriend to replace one that had broken. The chain is well made and looks to be a beautiful piece of jewelry. Her eyes lit up when she opened it so it must be pretty good. The price is very reasonable and the shipping speed was blazing. Great product, great seller."
1,"I love this chain! I was not a silver person, but I am now. This chain is absolutely stunning, eye-catching and beautiful. It is of very good quality and it is substantial. Has a good weight to it, but yet I don't know I have it on. I ordered the 16"" which falls just at the nape of my neck. My husband loved it when he saw it. You will not be disappointed with the shine and the quality of this chain. It's very very sturdy, and I am absolutely thrilled with it. I plan to buy more silver jewelry now. It was a great price (an unbelievable price), and they shipped it to me immediately. There was no wait, and it was very well-packaged. I would recommend this chain to anyone who wants a bright, shiny, sturdy, comfortable chain."
1,"It is a very nice and sturdy chain, the clasp is big enough to open/close with no difficulty. Looks good, very bright and shiny."
1,"I bought a nice locket for my youngest daughter for Christmas, but the chain that came with it was too delicate and she was afraid it might break. We picked out this chain and she just loves it! It is very attractive with the locket and she feels confident that it will last.Thanks."
1,"This was purchased for my mother-in-law's birthday. A charm was also purchased at the same time. She loved both the chain and the charm. Great Price, Good quality...satisfied buyer and happy recipient! Super fast delivery too! Definitely will purchase from again."
1,"I bought this along with a pendant and the shipping was great. When the items came in I was thrilled, the chain is beautiful and the pendant looks great hanging from it."
1,This length chain is hard to find. The quality and the price were great and I love it!
1,"Attractive Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 14"" 16"" 18"" 20"" 22"" 24"" 30"" NecklaceVery nice."
1,awesome product fast shipping. Purchased for a friend and he never takes it off. Completely worth the great price. Would buy again. Thank you!
1,"I must admit I was pleasantly surprised when I received the necklace! It is very pretty, sturdy and is of better quality than I expected for the price. It was shipped promptly. I am very happy with my Sterling Silver necklace. My pendant looks great on it. Highly recommend!"
0,"You get what you pay for...in this instance. I think 1mm is too thick for most small/elegant style pendants. The color is also really light. It's not a nice silver shimmer, it almost looks white. The whiteness and the thickness of this necklace doesn't go well together. Not worth it in my opinion. Someone said it looks like a doggie necklace. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point."
1,This was a Christmas Gift for my wife. She had a log cabin pendent with no chain. She liked it .
1,"Purchased this necklace for my girlfriend when her white gold one broke. We couldn't justify the $100+ cost of a similar white gold box chain, and this one looks just as good! Strong, very pretty and not to thick. Very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended!"
1,I have not wore any jewelry for years because I am very sensitive. Even jewelry which claims to be nickel free usually bothers me so I gave up. I don't know why I decided to try again but glad I did. I purchased 2 chains from two companies claiming nickel free. One I had a reaction almost immediately but I have been wearing this chain for 3 days now with no problem. I will definitely buy more from this company.
1,"I purchased 2 16-inch and 1 18- inch necklace. They are very well made, beautiful. Still sparkled after I had for few months.love my necklaces !"
1,"Good value for the very reasonable price. Chain is just as described, pretty durable and very attractive. I wear it frequently, usually with charms, and I am very pleased."
1,I bought this necklace for myslef because it is bright and it is noticed all the time. It is durable as well. It can hold some weight as well. It stays bright. Just the right length as well. There is nothing negative that comes to mind about this necklace. I will end up ordering more of these because I do need two more.
1,"I was very Pleased with the necklace. Of course so much better looking than the photo can show. But it does a pretty good job of showing how pretty it is. Truly love the silver box that comes with. Makes it so nice & easy when gift giving, as I usually do. I will most certainly be purchasing more items. Thank you for your quality items. Robin Griffin."
1,I DIDN'T BUY THE CHAIN FOR MYSELF. I'M GIVING IT TO SOMEONE FOR CHRISTMAS WITH ACHARM TO MAKE A PENDANT. SILVER CHAINS ARE EXPENSIVE AND I HAD ALREADY DONE MOST OFMY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING FOR THIS PERSON ALL I WAS LACKING WAS A CHAIN. I SHOPPED ONLINE AND IT LOOKED LIKE I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET HER A CHAIN TOO EXPENSIVE SO I FOUND THIS ONE AND BOUGHT IT. THANKS
1,"Purchased this necklace, and am very happy with it. Its a great product for the price!"
1,"This is a great product. I have never before seen chains of this quality for such low prices! And even though the prices are low, the product is not cheap quality. The chain is very pretty and durable. I've had mine for a while now and I've not seen any visible wear or tarnish on it. I exchange the chain between several different pendants and it works and looks great! Highly recommend this product."
1,I bought this after looking at a much more expensive chain. This one is perfect and the price made me very happy. I've worn it for several months and there have been no issues. I will definitely buy from this seller again.
0,This chain is dainty and small. Its a nice chain. I always liked the box chain since it doesnt catch on clothing or hair. I purchased this for my 8 year old but the length was too short for her. So I ended up returning it.
1,I bought this chain for my son. It is of nice quality and beautiful. I would recommend it as an inexpensive sterling silver chain.
1,Great necklace. It has held up quite well and I would recommend this to anyone else.
0,"I was astonished to find a sterling silver chain for such a low price. Maybe it was just the chain I ordered, but the clasp broke after less than two months of gentle use. It looks good, lays well and you can't beat the price, but now the next box chain I buy will be at cost plus the price of this one. Not fixable.UPDATE 2/15/2011"
1,This was for my daughter. Very sturdy and just as pictured. The price was great!
1,Good quality and great price.I added a silver charm and it made a great gift. I bookmarked your site so I can order more in the future.
0,When I got this I was happy but with in two days it broke then I was sad and upset
0,"It is past the due date & have yet to receive the product yet. I don't know if it's lost in the mail or what but, I'm not impressed."
1,"My husband bought a charm exactly like this one in Italy fifteen years ago, and wore it until a summer three years ago when he lost it at the beach. This one is exactly like the one he lost. He will be so delighted when he opens it on Christmas morning."
1,PERFECT FOR EVERY DAY WEAR AND FOR A GOOD PRICE . . . . . . . . . .
1,"I was looking for a replacement silver chain for a pendant I own. This is just the right length and weight, and so far, no complaints on durability or snagging on clothing. I plan to order 2 more in other lengths - at these prices, you cannot miss!"
1,"I never take my jewelry off, I wash with it, and play with it...I have broken so many chains it's not funny. Most necklaces and bracelets come with chains that if you sneeze wrong it's broken and the clasps are a joke most of the time. Another reason why I stick with sterling silver now.This chain so far looks like it will go the distance, and if it lasts a year with me then you can be sure it is quality! I will let you know. SO far it's been a month which is still pretty good for most chains."
1,I got this necklace to wear all the time with a cross pendant which I never take off. I wear it all the time and it has heald up thru showers and sleeping and all. I am very happy with this chain. It still looks like the day I first put it on.
1,I bought one for my little sister in my sorority and it is fabulous! BUY THIS!
1,I was very happy with this purchase. It was a beautiful product. Exactly as promised.
1,"I received lots of compliments. These look great with white as well as pastel colored cuffed shirts. Very elegant in appearance. Though, they seem a bit delicate and are smaller in size than I expected."
1,I bought these earrings to match a Janice Girardi blue pearl bracelet that I own. The pearls and settings were a perfect match. The price was reasonable and the delivery was quick. I love the blue pearls.
0,"I bought this, and threw it away... It wasnt worth the postage to sent it back to the wherever it came from. The box it came in was lovely... and the earrings looked like cheap pickNsave junk... dont bother with this."
1,Got this for my wife she loved it and she hates jewelry. Is a great everyday piece.
1,I love this piece. I love the box cut of the pendant. Very classy but fun with a great price.
1,Beautiful warm honey coloring with interesting occlusions in a unique setting. I purchased a longer chain than the one it came with. It's larger size kinda needs the longer chain. I love it and so does everyone else who has seen it!
0,"Just a cheap plastic thing, don't buy. dissapointed cause I brought it to Mexico and it will be harder to return."
1,"Of all the items I was buying when I bought this, I do believe this one was one of the top two favorites. I'm actually wearing it right now, as I type this review. It's simply beautiful. And this one looks a little better in person."
1,"This is an attractive pendant for the price, and the piece of amber in my pendant is quite lovely with trapped items that shimmer nicely. Seems to be high quality. I'm very pleased. It is fairly dainty, not real small but not sizable either, so do note this. And it does click a bit inside the silver ball, which isn't a problem for me personally."
1,I luv cufflings & these luscious red lips really makes my dress shirts even more feminine; i get a lot of compliments.
0,"these are really nice earrings. the only thing that bothered me was since the item picture was so close, i thought they would be a bit bigger. other than that they are really cute. so, if u like larger studs to be seen from afar, go for a 7mm or 8mm."
1,"These earrings are a great size, shiny, pretty and a great buy. I really like them in my second hole and are small enough to wear with a pair in the first hole and big enough to be seen.I highly recommend."
1,"I got these earrings for my Valentine's present, and they are wonderful! I love the design, the dragons are sinuous, but really aren't Oriental dragons, and they aren't the heavy bodied Continental dragons, they really are more (my favorite) Celtic dragons, but with a modern look. Also must note that the detailing is quite good, you can see the dragon's spikes along the back of his neck, and even little scales on the body. I love them in this passionate red color also. Will cherish them for years to come, I'm sure."
1,Clean and legible printing on charm even tho it's a longer name it still looks great. Looks beautiful on plain italian charm bracelet. Perfect starter charm. This is a great buy! I would recommend this with any name!
1,"Although glass, they do look like opals, and have a lovely irridescent quality"
0,"The pendant is lovely and looks like the picture, but I had two problems with it. The first is that when I wore the pendent, it completely lost its translucent quality. It looked like a dark purple rectangle and the dragon was hardly visible. The second problem is that every time I leaned forward, even slightly, the pendant would flip around to the other side. Within the space of an hour the pendant spent as much time with its back to the world as it did with the carved side facing front. That may not bother everyone, but it drove me crazy, so I reluctantly returned the pendant. The chain was handsome but did not feel substantial enough for this pendant. But, you can always use a different chain."
0,"I ordered this product twice, and returned it twice. The first time the chain was so tangled in the beads just above the dragon that it couldn't be untangled without removing a head pin. This tangling had to have happened during the manufacturing process, it couldn't have tangled that way on its own. The second one came out without an end ring with which to connect the chain to the spring ring clasp.The dragon itself was beautiful, and Amazon was very good and very prompt about handling the returns. However, I decided that the third time was not going to be the charm and declined to have it replaced yet again."
1,"This has survived a move and numerous 'underways' (the owner is a sailor) so I feel it is worth the money. When I received it in the mail I thought it would break easily but, like I wrote, it has been through quite a lot and is still in one piece (and the owner is notorious for breaking things)."
0,"My husband bought this for me for our anniversary, and it broke the same day. It's beautiful, but the clasp snapped off after I had been wearing it for only a couple hours. Very disappointing."
1,I've purchased two of these - one I gave as a gift and one I kept for myself. I feel both were of good quality.
1,"I am the seller of these bracelets. Because they are made of semi-precious gemstones, they do sometimes get damaged in shipping. We are happy to exchange them including free shipping."
0,"I like these earrings, but they tend to itch, so there may be some nickel in them. Otherwise I like them."
1,"These bracelets are precious. They aren't high quality, but I didn't pay for high dollar for high quality. Purchased these for my younger grand daughters and they are perfect. They will love and cherish them."
1,It is very beautiful and I love it.....by Dayna....8 years old. I got it on Christmas Eve from by Grandparents.
0,Picture looks great....but not the product itself. Save your money or spend extra few bucks to get a bettr one.
0,Would not recommend getting this. Had to return it.
0,"The picture you see is slightly decieving. The item is small and the chain is weak. It is worth the $49 I paid for it. Not a great deal by any means. If I would have paid the list price, i'd be talking to Amazons refund dept."
0,"I have sent the necklace back several weeks ago and I have not heard a reply, gotten my money back NOTHING!! I would like my money back please!!!"
1,"We just had twins and my wife wanted something that was cute. As you could imagine being a new family with twins we are no longer rich! LOL! This is actually a nice piece of jewelry. Of course keep in mind this is not a product from Tiffany's but for what it is, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget. The piece shows nice and appears to have some ""staying"" power."
1,I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Mother's Day. She has given me three beautiful grandchildren. She loved it!
1,"These earrings are just beautiful. Suitable for a tall person and very well made, without beeing heavy. Carolyn Pollack has the best jewelry if you are looking for big, bold, statement pieces. If it`s about rings, earrings or pendants you can find great craftsmanship. I bought and i will buy her jewelry, it`s a pleasure to stare at your hand or at your neck. You feel the beauty and it`s just making your day. About price, what can i say? I don`t know what i`m paying for. Thanks Carolyn!"
1,"I love this ring. It can be worn for dress or with casual clothing. The color is deep and the marcasite setting adds to its beauty. I have long slim fingers, and it is sized perfectly for my hand. Wearing it creates an elegant Victorian look. I have received numerous compliments on this elegant piece."
1,It is so good that the people think it is real red coral. I am always wearing it and no discoloration after 6 months. Great buy.
1,"Needed a chain for a diamond journey pendant I had - and I wanted it in 2 days. I got exactly what I wanted - lovely rose gold color that matches perfectly and received it in 2 days in time for my night out. Great price, great-looking chain, great shipping, great seller!"
1,The earrings are nice quality and the color of the pearl is nice and copper-y. Actual product matched description of item.
1,"I am so happy with the service, my ring came in a short amount of time and looks as beautiful as it does in the picture. Everytime I wear it, I get compliments on the beauty and the quality of the ring."
1,"These are very lovely, and exactly as pictured. They do seem to go with everything I own. I am very pleased - and what a great price!"
0,Unless I'm suddenly senile.....that's a Blackhawks logo....
1,"Great clear, glass plugs. Got them in honey (10g) and smoke(8). Just enough of a wear area to allow for air to circulate as well as short enough to hardly notice they are on when you sleep on your side."
1,"I purchased the 14k gold and the sterling silver anchor charms. They are nice quality. Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought the size was perfect because I was looking for small charms. The anchor is actually a bit taller than the measurement listed."
0,This ring was a little too small for my ring finger. It would have been better as a pinky ring.
1,"Sabrina won't dissapoint. The ""fastest"" delivery. And, without paying extra!Hundreds of choices available. Christmas is only around the corner (A greatstocking stuffer!)"
0,"These earrings are very thin hoops, which I knew from the product description. They are hollow and not polished or shiny. They are very lightweight. It all depends what you are looking for, I guess, as to wether or not these will suit you. I do not prefer dull looking sterling, so these were a disappointment."
1,"this item is really beautiful, you must have it in your collection. it looks really sexy."
0,"It was okay but its only finished on one side. Its great for a necklace, not so good as a charm."
1,"I am truly delighted with the jewel I bought here. It will make a wonderful Christmas present, but I wish I could have kept it for me ! It is really very delicate and original craft, although we find beautiful jewels in Europe, this kind is more difficult to get, especially at this price. Excellent transaction, thank you very much.,"
0,"I only own a few pieces of jewelry and was hoping to add this supposedly beautiful piece to my collection as a treat, but the bracelet looks cheap, the pearls fake, uniform, grayer with much less luster than in the picture. The concept was nice, but the actual item doesn't showcase it. The cost of shipping was more than the actual item itself and returning it is going to cost me another $8.50 so I'm not going to bother. Do not recommend the item unless you can get it for cheaper than 75% off and possibly directly at the source so you don't have to pay for shipping.The items bracelet arrived in small box, a lilac package in a pool of Styrofoam cheetos. Ordered on the 19th, received it on the 22nd so at least it was a speedy delivery especially since it was standard."
1,The photo of this ring is a very good representation of the ring that I received. It was received in a timely manner and in great condition.
1,"I was very, very pleased with this necklace! It is absolutely gorgeous! The only thing I don't like about it is that it's kind of heavy and the hook clasp isn't like any ""normal"" necklace hook clasp."
1,"If you can't find what you need here, you'll never find it!! Adorable items, fast delivery, and wonderful service. I'll use this site again. Too, too cool. Thanks."
1,"I had not found a charm like this and had been looking. I ordered it on Amazon, it was here fast and just exactly what I wanted."
0,Incredibly weak. Fell off repeatedly.. then finally lost it. Bracelet has several charms but this one is very cheaply made. Incredibly disappointed.
1,This item is even more lovely than the pic. I have bought several items from JeGem and have been thoroughly pleased with each purchase
1,"These plugs look rather darker than in the photo above, both in and out of my ears, more brown than brownish-yellow. I don't know if it's a difference between batches or just the lighting for the photograph.I discovered glass jewellery a couple of months ago and decided to use these for a fresh stretch from 8ga to 6ga (since I'm a science student, to me ""g"" is ""grams"" not ""gauge""). I used an acrylic taper to stretch my earlobes and put these in by butting them up against the end of the taper. My ears were inflamed for the first few days, so the glass was good since the dried pus and serum a.k.a. ""crusties"" doesn't stick to it as much as to metal."
1,"I bought these for my boyfriend's stepmom and she loved them! I had been trying to find a gift that would be perfect but without ""trying too hard"", ya know? But when I saw them I knew they were going to be the ones. She put them on right away :)"
0,"The ring is beautiful in itself! But I found it a little on the small side! The service was great though, I got the ring in no time at all!"
1,"I lost my fav toe ring..saw this and thought it would look good...figured for the price it was probably cheap quality and no great loss if it fell off and was lost. It is actually of a very good quality..and looks great..Now I will be sad if I lose it...nice ring, especially for the price!"
0,"The heart to chainlink solder has already broken once. Because the chain has extra rings for allowing different sizing, I was able to manage a repair myself. However, I don't expect this ankle chain to last very long given the quality of the materials."
0,"This cheap thing lasted me less than a month. I remember taking it out during a business meeting and it was rusting, it was so embarrassing I threw the thing out."
1,This necklace is beautiful! The beads are awesome! The price is Great! The vendor shipped it out immediately. I would definitely buy from them again!
1,I love these earrings. I was so impressed that I emailed the company right away to tell them so. They are just what I wanted and they came in a beautiful box. I can't wait for my daughter to open them on Christmas day.
0,"The cross is modeled right after the famous cross that Buffy wore in season 1, and 2.The product it self isn't meant to be an official symbolic object of the lord, hence, on the back of the cross we have a ""FOX 2005 TM"" trademark. However, any buffy fan will be very glad to own this. This 2 inch, silver, cross is very gender neutralized, as in, a male or female could easily wear it without worrying if it's ""famine"" or ""masculine,"" however, the 18 inch necklace itself is very famine looking. I myself am a 6'0 male, and the necklace was to short to wear with comfort, so I ended up using a different chain.The velvet box is very tasteful, and does have the buffy logo right on top. It's just like any other box a normal ring, ear rings, etc, would come in. The inside is no different."
1,"My girlfriend loves her bracelet, it shine brilliantly in the sunlight.Good quality, great price... Arrived before estimated time. Will buy fromthis seller again and will recommend to all my friends."
1,"Sterling Silver 2.5 mm Heavy Italian Snake Chain Nickel Free. 7"", 8"", 16"", 18"", 20"", 22"", 24"", 30""Needed to exchange item. I wanted a heavier chain. The service from JewelryWeb was excellent.Would shop with them again with confidence"
0,"The earrings are unique but very ""flimsy"". I haven't worn them yet and truly hope they will stand up to normal wear. I will keep them for several reasons...1) Harry Mason guarantees them 2) I like the style 3) I need the Rose Gold 4) they are unique. Besides the extremely light weight of the solid 14 Kt. Gold, I think the price was a bit high. I would not have purchased them if I had to pay the additional $7.95 that Harry Mason charges for s/h...thanks Amazon for that perk."
1,"I received the gold ones in this same design and absolutely loved them so I HAD to get the rose gold to go with all my rose gold jewelry. You just can't beat them, they hang beautifully from my ears and are the perfect length. Not to long, not to thick & just enough weight and body to them that they dangle nicely."
1,This is one of the pretties pieces of costume jewelery I've seen in a while. I also bought a charm that is spectacular. Definitely recommend.
1,"I love this bracelet. My lovely husband gave it to me, just because. It's pretty heavy, which I like and shines well. I don't wear it every day as I want it to last longer without too many scratches. Just wish JC stuff were not as pricey."
0,"first picture does not match the second. the second is taken from the actual website. visibly poor quality, yet costs as much as the real thing. might as well purchase from Juicy online."
1,This is a very outstanding chain. Anyone can wear it. I bought it for my husband and it is very sexy looking. It is a great price and it looks more expensive on. I am thinking about buying me one.
1,"Super smooth transaction! Earrings were shipped fast and arrived just as promised. I would most certainly do business again with this seller. Thanks! Oh, and by the way my daughter loved them!"
1,These earrings are a great size and absolutely gorgeous! I highly recommend for anyone who loves moonstone or Victorian jewelry!
1,"So pretty my family bought me two pairs, which, of course is the problem when the list does not automatically update when you buy from another store...oh well, now I have an extra pair! Can't send them back because that would cost more than half the price of the item, not worth it! But at least I like them and they go with everything! Plus, I always loose one anyway."
1,"I love this ring. It is, however, the second time in less than a year that I ordered one. I feel it should be mentioned that the ring is delicate and can break if accidentally hit against a hard surface. I don't know if it's genuine or synthetic since both words are mentioned in the description. It doesn't matter much, though, because the ring is inexpensive and beautiful. The picture doesn't come close to how pretty it really is. I broke it by clapping my hands and it hit another ring on the other hand during a Bears playoff game!"
0,"In the picture the ring appears mostly white, and well half mine is whitish and the other half is translucent., so i was a little upset at that, but it's a $5 ring so you get what you pay for. doesn't feel like plastic to me, feels more like glass and has a neat glow. biggest downside is it's massive thickness. i bought both this ring and the onyx band and the onyx is much thinner and comfortable and you could forget your wearing it. I feel the moonstone is there the entire time i have it on."
0,I purchased this ring as a pinky ring. It was beautiful and well made but all it took was one hit against a door handle and it cracked. So While I do really like this purchase I would not recommend for every day use. Maybe it could be party wear :)
0,It is very interesting looking and exactly as promised though. The pictures do not do it justice. I'd recommend being careful with it though as it doesn't look like it will last long if you don't exercise caution with it.
1,"like most of the other reviewers on here, the picture does not do it justice. i was pleasantly surprised, because i own several genuine moonstones, and while this is a synthetic, i still didnt expect it to be as pretty as it was. it is more like an opal than moonstone, but that isnt a negative thing at all, just means there are many more colors and it is very reactive with light. for this price, you really cant go wrong. i havent had mine long yet, so i cant contribute to the statements others have made about how fragile it is, but it DOES say on the description that it is fragile, and not to buy it if you cant treat it with proper consideration."
1,"Great value for this ring, it was bought as a gift and my sister loved it!"
0,"had to send it back, but if they had it in my size i would love it"
1,Beautiful black crystal choker with silver beads between each crystal. I like how there is no latch to fuss with when you are putting it on or taking it off. Product comes in a lined pouch to protect it while being shipped. Delicate yet durable. Beautiful piece of jewelry.
0,Unfortunately it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm not a fan of chokers that are set on memory wire. Very pretty but uncomfortable to wear. Elastic string would have been much better.
1,The bracelet is made from a gorgeous brushed steel and is beautifully designed. It's very stylish and subtle. Simply put -- it was the perfect gift for my metrosexual husband.
1,"One of the most beautiful moissanite rings. The stone is beautiful and sparkles like it's on fire. Also, the shank is very modern and simple. The ring looks designer."
1,"Excellent product made well, it's very smooth and does not snag on fine material. Perfect size it easly fits the small opening on the pendent.Great price for a ""14K White Gold Necklace."""
0,This pair of earrings are sweet but plain. The stone is thin. What you see is what you get.
1,i bought this ring some time ago. the fit was perfect. what i loved best was the delicate little leaves can be gently positioned. this is a very comfortable ring and i get lots of compliments when i wear it. a nothing price for something so pretty.
0,"It's smaller than I thought it would be and the leaves don't look as delicate as pictured. I bought the ring as a size 7 and ended up having to adjust it to a size 6 just to make it look like the picture. It's still a nice ring, but I got what I paid for."
0,This ring looks gorgeous but because it sticks up it gets caught on everything. It is not worth the problems of wearing it. If you are someone who doesn't do anything or doesn't have to reach into a pocket book for anything you will be fine. Like I said looks great but cumbersome to wear.
1,I was nice and my mom loved it and it came in a box and everything like they said it was so 5 stars
1,"The picture of the ring doesn't do it justice; it is more subtle and substantial. I meant the ring as a guard for another ring that was getting too large, but the first ring was way smaller than the size I ordered. It only fit my pinkie, but I loved the look of it and decided to try again and ordered a larger size than what I ordered before. This one came back big enough to wear on my middle finger if I wanted, but it fits OK on my right ring finger. It acts as a guard for the bigger ring, but I also like to wear it by itself.I like wearing both side by side as well, and the star design is very peaceful yet empowering. If you like a classic looking band, you won't go wrong ordering this one. Size up or down from your regular ring size, depending on how you want to wear it. I think you'll love it as well."
1,"I have not seen this item in person, but I bought had it sent to my mom as a gift and she LOVES it. She said the amethyst is dark in color and is quite large."
0,"These are cute. The chips are a not that big, good for a casual day.I thought the were going to be bigger and better quality chips."
1,THIS WAS A GIFT TO OUR DAUGHTER IN LAW AFTER OUR 2ND GRANDDAUGHTER WAS BORN. SHE WEARS IT DAILY. BEAUTIFUL PICE.
1,"I had bought this for my mom when I was 8 yrs old, I saved up all my pennies and dollars from lunch. I'll never forget the day I gave it to her, she still has it and she still gets compliments on it 11 years later. I had purchased it in gold and it really is a timeless piece of jewelry a great purchase lol. Now I too am looking for this exact same pendant in silver since I'm going to be a new mommy soon. I love this pedant!"
1,"This item was purchased as a gift. It arrived 2 days earlier than expected; the package was in excellent shape. The large size is perfect for a woman who is 5'6"" or taller and the figures are beautifully sculpted. It looks much more expensive than it is. The only improvement I could wish for is that the presentation box could be of better quality. Thanks for a great product!"
1,I was so happy that I found this necklace. My Dad gave me this when I was a little girl before he passed away. It was lost in a move with all my photos of him. So thanks for making me very very happy
1,I saw this box and knew it would be perfect to go with a necklace I found. It arrived before the expected delivery date and was as I expected.
0,"This ring was ok, but the outer parts of the ring bend very easily and the stone itself rattles after a week of owning it. This ring is exactly what you are paying for, it really wasn't exactly what i expected but i should have known better. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone."
1,These very comfortable earrings add razzle dazzle to any outfit casual or for a ritzy night on the town.Can't go wrong with these knock-outs.
0,"I would love to buy this pendant, but have no idea as to the length of it. If it was added, it would influence a purchase from me. Thank you."
1,"Somehow the pugster charms I purchased came without a box big enough for a blank bracelet-watch, and four charms. This did it."
1,"This piece is well worth the money. Plus it arrived in three days! My wife loved it!! Thank you.SteveVentura, CA"
1,I am realy pleased with my peice of jewellery and i would buy of this seller again. I bought an egyptian cross of them and I always wear it round my neck on a heavy silver chain and the st christopher is round my neck as well also it was a good price as is all their items.
1,i bought this for a teenager who won a pagent. she loved it & put it on immediately & didnt take it off the whole time of my visit. was a surprise to have necklace included. wasnt expecting that!
1,"Another beautiful item from SilverSpeck. I wondered about how fragile they would be with six beads, but they aren't loose at all. The pair I have shows all the beautiful shades of Sodalite. I was so glad to find this style and in one of my favorite stones."
0,the chain is poor quality and the pendant is not the same as in the movie. the pendant fell off the chain multiple times. Unsatisfied!!!
1,"AS SOON AS I PUT THIS NECKLACE AROUND MY NECK I LOVED IT...THE SERVICE WAS FAST AND IN GREAT CONDITION, A MUST HAVE FOR THE ROCKY FAN...ITS SLIGHTLY TARNISHES BUT IS STILL VERY AWESOME!!"
1,"Nice, comfortable and not so small as not to be seen .Good casual or dressy - I have slept wearing them with no problems."
1,"To be honest, when I purchased these earning I wasn't sure whether or not I made the right decision as to buy them, but I was not disappointed, I was amazed how beautiful they were, the dangle on them are the right size the color is just radiant the sun goes through these earnings better than a diamond in your ear. They are the right size and very very light you don't even know you have earnings in your ear. if you want to buy yourself a real surprise these are the right gift."
1,"I think they are just beautiful, and I gave them for Christmas gifts. They were so pleased to have such a fine piece of jewelry.I purchased from Amazon as I did the Cool Daddy, also for a Christmas gift. My son, and his children couldn't wait to try it, said the shrimp were perfect.Kathryn E. Scanlon"
1,"These earrings...they look as marvelous as the picture suggests! They have that special sparkle, they're a real deal! I recommend this to all my readers."
1,"I just love these earrings. You can wear them with anything. They take on the color of anything you wearing and sparkle beautifully with a ""burst of color"". I highly recommend them. They are also very feminine and have just the right amount of dangle. Nice purchase and would purchase from this vendor again in a second!!! Also, they merchandise arrived VERY quickly. Thanks!"
1,Very beautiful and nicely made. I was pleased that they were larger than I had hoped for - they go with many different colors and styles of outfits. Would purchase again.Good service also.
1,I really like the way these earrings reflect the light in different colors! They go with any outfit! Great price! Prompt shipping!
0,"good very pretty, a gift for my mon but very very small. its not a bad prooduct 100 % Swarovski..."
1,These earrings are SOOO beautiful! I would definately buy these again! They go with everything!
0,THEY ARE VERY LONG..DIDN'T REALIZE IT WHEN I ORDERED THEM..AND THE SILVER DISK IS VERY CHEAP LOOKING..ALMOST JUNK JEWELRY LOOKING..
0,"Item did not look like the picture. The photo showed the gold with a nice shine, diamond cut. The item arrived as a dulled gold. The item was a gift, I had no time to return. Will not purchase from seller again"
1,"This band is so beautiful. It's thin and makes my finger ""sparkle"". ;)Will look into buying more of their rings."
0,"I bought this for my boyfriend, because he loves turtles. It is a unique piece and I like the creativity that went into it. However, the size is so small. It truly would be beautiful if it wasn't so small and it's my fault for not reading. It's a shame though that pictures of items sold online are enlarged to look bigger. The title on this should be"
1,This ring is super cute and looks great on. I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. The sizing was right on compared to what I normally wear too.
1,"My daughter doesn't stop playing with her normal stud earings and often twists them on their retainer bar making them difficult to remove. We got these for her and while they are basic in design, and small in size!! they are perfect for her small ears and no more stuck earings..."
1,I have multiple piercings in both ears and was tired of studs. I put one of these on one of the piercings going up my ear. It took awhile to get it in but I know that it will not fall out or get hooked on anything.
1,"I just got two pair of these in the mail today, and I absolutely LOVE them! I have small, attached earlobes and have never been able to find the tiny hoops I wanted until now! They are so cute, they don't irritate my sensitive skin, and they are too small for my baby to grab and yank! Now I just need 5 more pairs.I had no problem fastening them - I just inserted them so the post entered the back of my earlobe and came out the front, then used a pair of hemostats to hold the post still so I could put it into the tube.These are definitely better quality than the buck-apiece ones you get at the mall... I'll update my review after I've had them in for a few weeks, to see how they hold up after non-stop wearing to sleep, shower, etc."
1,"these teeny little earrings are exactly what I was looking for. They're small, comfy, and with a little practice, not too hard to put in. I would not recommend them for anyone who changes their earrings quite frequently, as they do take more time than regular earrings, but I was looking for something that I could just leave in. they hug the earlobe but are not at all tight or uncomfortable. (they might be if your earlobes are a little bigger). overall, perfect for what I was looking for."
1,"This was precisely what I was looking for- unobtrusive & doesn't call too much attention to itself. Also, the low price is worth it-don't be fooled it's a quality piece of merchandise. My opinion"
1,"Just like every other item I have got from Sabrina Silver this is a quality, value for money item. These hoops are tiny so please double check the size befor you purchase."
0,so small a child couldnt even wear these. unable to open the clasp they were so small. Dont do it!!
1,"This bracelet is so beautiful! Nobody would ever know they are not real diamonds. The setting is just great, light shines in from all directions. They way the stones are set THEY CAN'T FALL OUT. I would give this bracelet a ""10"" if the rating went that high."
0,its pretty and only 7 dollars but some of the stars are mishapen
0,"The bracelet actually measures about 7-7.5"" closed. The clasp bends very easily, and the ""bar"" it clicks onto is actually an extremely thin strand of metal. I suspect it'll break within a week or so.Unfortunately, I bought this for my husband a couple days more than a month before Valentine's Day - it can't be returned.Ah well. At least it wasn't outrageously expensive. But save yourself the angst - don't buy it."
0,"It's a nice ring, but looks more than a little weathered with obvious imperfections with some of the elephants. This could be part of the 'antique' look, though."
1,"I also have this ring, and I am very happy with the size of the ring, and the price, looking forward to having more pieces with the smoky quartz stones, great ring, great price, great value."
1,i also have this ring. it is truly a beauty. the stones are beautiful and the setting is great quality. this ring looks like it cost three or four times the price you pay. could not be more happy.
1,"This ring is more beautiful in person than in the picture. It really sparkles and is bigger than I expected. I am thrilled with it. The sizing was perfect, too."
1,This looks like my 300 weatherby and goes perfect with my glock 21. Thank u so much for making it
1,"Very pleased the size is perfect for an adult and older children 7 and up would be alittle to big for an infant the back of the pendant has a pretty criss-cross design very nice product not too thin needless to say I'm back for more want mom, sisters and all my nieces to have one of these from me."
1,"It was the perfect gift! I bought it for my mom's christmas present and because my brother and myself both paddle, this was the perfect gift for her. When I finally saw it, it was petite and just dangled well on the charm bracelet! MOVE OVER TIFFANY!"
1,"I have owned a LOT of belly button rings over the years. Normally, the dangly ones break off after a week or so of wearing. This one is still going strong, even after a month! It's also very shiny and sparkly, which is important as I use it mainly when I belly dance. It even came in a cute little box, and shipping was very quick. The colors of the jewels are true to the picture, as well."
0,I purchased a pair of hoop earrings and knowing that they were not expensive; but I truly expected more than what I purchased. The wires were broken when I opened them when taking them from the package and I ended up tossing them away. What irritated me the most is that the cost of mailing was more then the earrings. When I received the package I noticed that the return address came from only 40 miles from my address. The company charged over $5 to ship these tiny little earrings that they could have just dropped in a reguar envelope and sent using regular postage. I really feel ripped off and won't purchase from this company again!
0,the product arrived in perfect condition. shipping is ridiculously slow. will not order again from this seller.
0,"These earrings are lovely, medium size and weight; they give a gentle tug to the ear, but are not so heavy as to be uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the design has two problems. First, the earwires are a very narrow gauge. One of mine broke off after a week of careful wear. I will have to visit a jewelry repair shop and pay to have them modified to accomodate heavier earwires, which will increase the price of the earrings. Second, the lotus flower dangles at the bottom tend to hang up on one another and become stuck, as a result of parts of the weave being uneven or too close together. Perhaps you will get a pair that does not hang up; I did not. In any case, the earwires are much too thin and too short to have the strength to support the earring. If you buy these, you might look into replacing the wires."
0,"These are very small and were badly bent on arrival. I was able to fix them, but I'm not happy with them. They were intended as a gift, now I'm not sure."
1,I bought this for a Xmas present for my daughter. They are big and gorgeous. A great value. She never takes them off!
1,Arrived in less than 3 days! The earrings are beautiful. Nice size. Perfect blue color. Classy setting. Great price! Very happy.
0,"I ordered this as a birthday present and read previous reviews. They were mixed, but the description sounded like the earrings would suit my needs and would come in a box. I received them in a plastic baggy that I almost overlooked in the shipping box. They looked very chintzy and I returned them immediately. I've always had good luck ordering from Amazon, just not this time."
1,"Just as described in the add. Beauffull setting. I would have liked a gift box, but it just came in a small velour bag."
1,"It's design is so simple, this beautiful color stands out so much.Big enough for other people to see those twinkles."
0,"The back screw of the left earring was defected,I tried to fix it and the next day it fell off my ear and could never find it again,so now I am left with the right one only.I don't recommend anyone to buy these earrings at all."
1,"These earrings are beautiful. They are huge and very bright and twinklie! The color is perfect. Also, they came so fast!"
1,"Hi,I am very interested in this piece. I had purchased a very similar bracelet in Cancun 3 years ago, and paid $40 for it then. I have lost my bracelet, and am trying to find the replacement. Can you tell me the weight of the piece? Thanks, Robyn"
1,Pictures can't really do justice for the rose pendant on this necklace. It's gorgeous - it has a lot of detail and dimension to it. I like that the necklace has three loops so you can adjust the length slightly. A great buy at a great price. I definitely recommend it.
0,The chain and medallion are way to small you can barely see the medallion when you have it on
1,"Sis' signature drink. When my sister comes for a visit, she calls me about 5 minuts out so hubby can start up the blender! So, when she received this charm in the mail, she thought it was hilarious. I haven't personally seen it yet but she is very happy with it, so I gave the item the benefit of the doubt and gave it 5 stars. It's the nicest maggie charm out there."
0,"I received my earrings in a timely manner, however, the packaging was not secure enough to prevent the earrings from arriving with scratches. Not only that, but the image is deceiving. I didn't anticipate these earrings being so large! I felt like I was transported back to the 80's!! The design is pretty, but the clasp makes the earring pretty difficult to easily secure. Not a good choice."
0,"If I could I would have returned it, but I did not bother because I only paid $10. It is a huge brooch. The picture is misleading. If you like big brooches, then go for it"
0,"I bought these as a gift for my friend but am exchanging them for some others. I wasn't particularly blown away by them as I was for the other ones I bought. The stones are nice, but the workmanship isn't too great (for ex., the stones arent centered on the disks and again, the silver looks coated or something). Overall, they're just OK. SilverSpeck has nicer selections to choose from."
1,"I purchased this ring as a gift to myself and am delighted with it. I wanted something I could wear anytime and with anything. I have worn this to the office, on the weekends when dressed in jeans, and to a few dinners when dressed more for evening and it compliments everything. The ring is quite feminine and the design unique; however the weight of the ring gives it a durability that stands up to everyday activities. I have been more than pleased with my choice to purchase this ring and would recommend it to other women, or to those men looking for something special, yet not overpriced to give to the women in their lives."
1,Earrings nicer than pictured - just what I wanted! Thanks. Great vendor.
1,this was my first anklet bracelet and everything was perfect I have nothing negative to say about the whole process I love my bracelet and will be buying from the site again
0,"This was not an Amazon-shipped product.The reason for the 1 star is that I never received the product.The vendor to which I was referred by Amazon did not pack the correct item and, accordingly, the item received was not the item ordered.When the vendor was contacted after receiving the item, the product was no longer available and the vendor did not volunteer to back order the product.To the vendor's credit, however, the item was able to be returned at no cost to me and my account was credited back for the purchase."
0,"A pretty bracelet and lightweight, but there was a kink in it right out of the box and part of the stamped design was missing. It wasn't as flexible as I like."
0,This bracelet is too long to wear around my wrist and I do not have small wrists.
0,"This item looks like it would be a heavyweight metal, when, in fact it is not. It almost has a 'plastic' feel to it. Other than that, the ring looks like the picture."
1,I like my necklace. I will get a sterling silver chain to go with it. I am not crazy about the black cord that came with it. This small pendant reminds me of a beautiful star standing in front of our moon & making it glow beautifully in our sky.
1,"I love this pendant. Its very shiny and sparkly and looks great with a nice chain. Great price, and the color is awesome."
1,I purchased this little bobble for my wife. It looks very good on her. She was very happy with my decision. The crystal is a nice shade of blue and the sterling silver compliments it.
0,The rings look absolutely awesome. Unfortunately they don't like my skin. They bleed out on my skin. Because of that I can't give them a great score.
1,I think they were beautiful and functional. the product came on tine and in great shape. Will buy again!
0,"Shipping was quick and it was packaged in cute little round ring box with green bow.However, the color of the stone is a light yellow, not the honey champagne color depicted on the webpage. The size 5 I ordered is more like a 6.5, way too big! It's too expensive to return because of shipping costs.Very disappointed."
1,This ring is awesome. It is very pretty and the diamonds looke real. I have gotten compliments on the ring.
1,"It's beautiful, fits perfectly and arrived in record time. It has the look and feel of a much more expensive ring. I love it!"
1,"I love this ring so much. I mainly bought it cause im sick of fake jewlery and this is far from fake. I love how it shines and my my and look pretty and it's my boyfriends birthstone so it reminds me of him. It's my favorite piece of jewlery and i can wear it with anything, and i get so many compliments on it. Glad i bought it"
0,The ring seems to run a little small as I cannot wear it on my ring finger. The yellow is not as warm as most citrines - it just looks fake. I will be giving to one of my daughters as I cannot wear it.
1,Please don't listen to the negative comments about this ring. I found the sizing to be spot on and the ring looks exactly like the pic (Except it shines more) I think the other reviewers thought it was the sex in the city remake ring. The color is so rich and it shines like the sun ;) It's my baby girl's birthstone and I wear this ring proudly! It's a little big but its so far from gaudy. I've gotten LOTS of compliments already. The price is a steal! You'll love this ring!
1,"I love it!!! True to size, bright sparkling gem, great gem size. Came in a cute little present box with fast delivery. Will defiantly order from them again."
1,"When I first saw it, I was amazed at how beautiful it is. The gem is big but it does not look cheesy. I usually like small dainty gem on my rings. This one is huge and it sparkles very nicely. The setting is beautiful. The only thing is the color is not what it portrays in the picture. It is more of a deep yellow, not orange brown as shown in the picture. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful ring. I can't believe the price."
1,"Item image and description are perfect. I was looking for a St. Mary charm and fell in love with this one immediately. When I opened it, I was just as pleased. The charm was received quickly and packaged well."
1,I have been wearing this earring since I have recieved it. It came in a timingly matter after being ordered and I have had no problems with it.
0,i wesh make it more itemscos it is it is vere nise itemthanx
1,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas because she's been wanting a fleur di lis pendant...When i saw this i thought ""well its a little different but it looks kind of cool"". When it arrived, I liked it even more..i might even buy myself one. Looks even better in person than in the picture."
1,"This ring is more stunning than what it appears on your screen. It is a ""must-have""; I have gotten so many compliments from my family and friends on how pretty and unique the setting is. I am very, very happy I bought it!!"
1,I really enjoy this ring. The coloring of the stone is absolutely gorgeous.Lots and lots of compliments for this ring everytime I wear it.
0,"14K Gold Dangling Spiral Threader EarringsWhere are the earrings?I've payed them but I never got them!!!They were an gift for xmas, for our grandma!!I want this earrings!!!OR you must booked back on our credit card.I find it not good, because I bought them, the shipping would be at the 4.12.07, and they never arrived!!Claudia Schunk"
1,Not shown in photo is a very beautiful romanesk setting that the stone sits on.One of the nicest pieces I've ever purchased under 10 dollars.
1,The pin is beautiful and well made. The design is pretty. I have one and gave one as a gift.
1,Just one of many items to replace those lost in our housefire. Very good quality. Wrapped Securely. Arrived early. Thank you to all involved. I have purchased other colors of this set and like them all.
0,earrings shown as large hoops. Earrings were medium at best.Very disappointed. Picture is not a true representation of size.
1,"I had to re-bend the twist, but I have to do that on every nose screw, so no biggie. Very delicate and pretty, a nice everyday nose pierce. Also, great fast shipping, good packaging!"
0,"I thought it was larger than it actually was but its still nice.I am overseas in the military and it came in like 7 days, pretty fast considering the circumstances. great transaction overall. i will definetly buy again."
1,Very Nice - I Like these alot - Not too little Not to Big
0,"I ordered this ring based on the photos, thinking that the stone would be a rich royal blue. When I received it, the stone was very dark, almost black. The photo also makes the gold look thick and substantial. The metal is so thin that I thought I was going to bend it by just trying it on. It's a very delicate ring, and not at all what I was expecting. I was surprised because I had ordered a ring from the amazon collection about a month ago, and was very pleased with the quality, so I came to trust that most anything from that particular collection would please me. I sent it back the same day I received it. I can see it being a value for its price, and you probably can't find much better in that range - I think I'm reacting more to the disparity between the pictures and the actual product."
1,I really enjoyed the Ring!! It was as pretty as the picture and they were very prompt with delivery!!
1,"I received the medal and was very very impressed with it. The craftsmanship is beautiful with all the detailing. The size was small but still very elaborate. And, the chain that came with it was just as impressive, not a cheapy one but a good strong one. I plan to give this medal to my 10yr old niece who was diagnosed with a blind disorder. I am so glad I came across this purchase!"
1,"This is a really cool stretch bracelet set allowing for an endless variety of ways in which this set can be worn, alone, or all 3, including your combination of stretch bracelets...the price affords an endless array which I'd highly recommend...the highly prized ""cats eye"" or, otherwise known in the jewelers trade as ""chatoyance"" is demonstrated in these pristine beads...:)"
1,"I bought the Sterling Silver High Polished Heart Hoop Earrings, and I'm so glad. I love these earrings! They're cute as can be without being tiny. They feel hefty for their size without pulling on my ears. They're just gorgeous and part of the beauty is the high polish. These little earrings have ""presence""."
0,"These earrings are simply gorgeous. They are weighty (as you'd expect with so many pearls), and hence the problem - they did well with the earrings and skimped on the hooks.the earrings are big, but not too big - they make a big impact. I put them on and tossed my hair, and one of the earrings flew off. The bend of the fish hook wires is awful. The gauge of the wire is too flimsy for the weight of the earring, and without a way to fasten these so they don't fly off, you won't have these earrings LONG (they're guaranteed to be lost.)What a shame the makers did such a wonderful job with the earrings and got cheap with the hooks.I'm still keeping them, though. I'm going to replace the cheap wires with sterling leverbacks (you can find replacement leverbacks in s/s for around $2.50 a pair shipped if you google it.)I got the earrings on sale, for less than fifteen bucks, so to me, it's worth the extra 2.50 to upgrade the earrings to the hangers they deserve.I'd recommend them highly - but I'd also recommend you get a pair of needle-nosed pliars and a new set of leverbacks if you want to keep the earrings!"
1,"I shopped in stores and online for a classic cross with just enough detail. This cross was perfect. It is beautiful in design, but not tacky. The size is appropriate for an adult (many crosses similarly priced were too small and made for a child). I get many compliments on this piece and I am very happy with it. It exceeded my expectations."
1,"This cross is very beautiful, but the picture with it is quite magnified. You cannot see all that detail with normal vision. However, I do like it and wear it with dressier outfits."
1,"high quality, came very nicely packaged with a free gift note on a beautiful card in an emvelope. Very satisfied with the purchase."
1,"Amazon Prime is amazing; I ordered this bracelet (having loved the similar pastel pearl bracelet), and it arrived FAST. The pearls are stunning in color and contrast. They're lustrous, just a little larger than jelly beans, have wonderful nacre and seem to glow in shades of golden caramel yellow, soft peach, gunmetal gray, charcoal plum and creamy porcelain white. As with the pastel pearl bracelet, it might be loose on smaller wrists like my own, but it isn't going to slip off easily. With about 37 total inches of pearls, it can be restrung into a necklace, bracelet and earring set if desired, but is terrific as-is. I'll order the matching endless necklace next, and enjoy the colors with lots of fall clothing. Pearl girls will love this bracelet!"
1,This is a lovely item - something you can put on an wear every day. I am very pleased with it.
1,"Although I probably could have found a similar Necklace at a store in town, I really liked the fact that it was supposed to be from Egypt. The chain is the perfect link to showcase my cartouche and is well made. A great gift or something for yourself."
1,After days of indept research on diamonds I went to a nationally chained jewelry store and paid $260.00 for a pair of diamond studs that were rated
1,What a wonderful birthday gift. They sparkle brilliantly and look like he paid three times as much. I love the elegant wood box they came in and the screw on backs for security. They also came with a certificate of appraisal...I absolutely love them and my husband for blessing me with them.
0,"This is a pair of really nice earrings. I searched a lot of stores and finally get one from Amazon.com for my anniversary. Although I have to wait over 4 weeks to get it, both my wife and I like it so much. It come with a pretty box and a certificate from International Gemological Institute. The whole thing is perfect except one problem.The only problem is that the back of one earring has some brown dirty rust-like things which is unacceptable. Another one has a very shining silver back. I have to return and get a replacement."
1,"Well folks,Your ol' pal Bitsy here to tell you about my latest adventure. I was eating a variety of popcorn meats while watching ""Cribs"" and I realized my bling factor was way, I mean, way low. I needed something that would Ice me up and down simultaneously. Being that times are tough I didn't treat myself to a new Bentley(I could've gotten a great deal on Jermain Dupri's freshly IRS seized). I wanted this year to be special, so I began my search. Now, understand there are more expensive rocks out there, but ""The Bits"" just don't get blinged to anything but the finest Platinum. When The earrings arrived they were stunning. The cut was nice so all the light in the room refracted up and joyed my eyes. Even in medium light they looked great in my ears, eyebrow or nostril. Don't worry, the posts are threaded to hold up that Bedrock. In Closing, if you are considering an intra-personal gift sure to please, bet Blingy with the 1.5Ct yummy num nums,"
0,"As can be the case with many jewelry items, the display sometimes far outshines the actual item, once received. The necklace is nice but somewhat lackluster and tends to fade into the background a little too easily."
0,I would have liked this much better if the silver coating had not been on two sides of the crystal cubes. You have to make sure it doesn't turn on your neck and the crystals are hidden behind the silver coating. It was okay not what I expected though.
0,"Item purchased on July 10, 2012, by November 28, 2012 it had broken...GEM AVENUE will NOT honor cheap quality product...DO NOT BUY from GEM AVENUE as they are more interested in the money; NOT the customer..."
1,Pendant was a beautiful surprise when I opened the box-even more gorgeous than the photo. Shipping was very prompt by Amazon. I purchased the matching earrings and I get many compliments when I wear the set. I would highly recommend this set for a gift or yourself.
1,"I got these to give to my mother-in-law. They are really lovely, not too dressy so you can wear them everyday. I'm glad I jumped on them while they were on sale, they'll be perfect for Mother's Day."
0,"They were beautiful, nice round pearls, but the colors were off. The black looking one in the picture turned out to be a bright magenta, and the silvery ones looked just like plain white pearls. That was kind of disappointing, but it might've been only me that it happened to. Otherwise, I'm pretty satisfied."
1,I got this set of earrings about a year ago. They are all good quality and look very nice. I am very pleased!
1,"I love these! They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box. They are much better than what I was expecting."
1,Wife loved it. Fit perfectly on her finger and loves the comfort fit so much she hardly knows it is there. A good priced ring and a great ring to have if you do rigorous work with your hands so she says.
1,My mother loves silver and she loves hearts so I thought she'd like these earrings. She LOVES them! I got them for her for Mother's Day and they arrived the day before. They are beautiful and such a great value.
0,Where is the certificate? I am not very happy with my purchase here. For $500 I would expect a nicer box and a certificate. Overall the diamonds do look nice.
1,"I saw this on Amazon and couldn't resist the deep purple color. I practically drooled, it looked so beautiful in the picture. The ""icing on my cupcake"" were the dainty freshwater pearls that complement the amethysts to perfection. Wow! I was hooked! I had to have this bracelet!When I received it, I was so pleased, I placed it on my wrist immediately, twirling around in delight as I showed it to my granddaughter. She rolled her eyes as she grinned at me, but later when I wore it with my nice black suit, she said it was stunning.Another plus for me is that it's a large piece of jewelry, which looks better on my medium bone structure.Needless to say, I recommend it highly, but feel that it would not look too good on a tiny woman; the size might be too overwhelming ... but to each her own.Reviewed by"
1,"My wife was truly impressed with this gift. The workmanship is beautiful, and the look is quite striking, unlike a lot of other sterling silver jewelry I've seen. As a bonus, the customer service people at Diva Diamonds were very responsive and helpful."
1,"I bought these lovely dangle earrings to complement the amethyst-and-freshwater-pearl stretch bracelet that I'd purchased from Amazon earlier. I'm very pleased with them. I enjoy the way they sparkle when the light catches them as they sway back and forth with my movements.Gorgeous purple color! You would have to see both pieces of jewelry together to appreciate the true beauty, but I'm the center of attention whenever I wear them. And that ain't bad for the old ego.Highly recommended!Reviewed by"
0,"I thought these were going to be made in the USA. They are not. They are just mass produced out of the country, I will not order from this vendor again."
0,"I still can't believe how big these earrings are! They are also very pretty, so I'll probably keep them anyway. Definitely not for everyday wear, unless you want to go for the drama. The picture is deceiving, it makes them look smaller. Pity."
1,Another Peora purchase. I bought these for Christmas from a friend who loves peridot. The color on these is deep and rich. The packaging is absolutely lovely and perfect for gift giving. Delivery took two days. These are a medium size earring and will look good on younger or not so young women. Very reasonably priced. Look much more expensive.
1,Bought these a Christmas gift for a friend. She loved them and wears them all the time. They look awesome on.
1,"The service and I got was refreshing and uplifting. From the refund I got when Angela found out that we are in the same state, to scheduling a personal delivery when the mailroom at my workplace almost lost the package, it was a pleasure working with Angela all along. I am delighted to recommend Dahlia Pearls to everyone... and did I mention, the earrings are beautiful!"
1,"very pretty earrings, move pink than a deep lavender, love to find pearls in a drop style, pretty good luster"
0,"The gold plated and silver Twin charms arrived and I was very dissapointed, they both feel very flimsy and not very solid. Compared to a 25 Pandora or Troll bead, there is a big difference in the quality of the items. I was shocked to find that the writing saying Twins isn't legible to the point where it is almost microscopic. This kind of defeats the point of this item, as that was my reason for purchasing it."
1,I absolutely loved this purchase. It came in the best casing in a velvet bag and the necklaces are absolutely beautiful. They will be gorgeous with the champagne and ivory bridesmaid dresses I have picked out. Pearls are timeless and these were a very nice gift to give to my close family and friends as a thank you for being part of our wedding.
1,"JUST BEAUTIFUL, VERY COMFORTABLE, I DECIDED TO PAY THE PRICE IN HOPES THAT THIS ANKLE BRACELET WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME, BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE IT..."
1,"The weight is minimal. The earring itself is gorgeous. It's rather sturdy for it's design. And I love it. But sometimes it does pinch and you want to be careful when adjusting the size of it because it is a light and flexible metal so you might work it too hard. So far I haven't broken it or anything, but I'm also really leery of doing just that."
0,"I received my order today, and I was so excited that I rushed into the bathroom to try on the earcuff. But there's a problem. The earcuffs (not one out of the three I bought) fit. Not one. Perplexed, I looked up instructions on how to put them on, in case I was doing it wrong, you know? But I was putting it on right. Its a fuss putting on this one and the little one with the feather, and both of them are too small so they pinch and squeeze the sides of my ear. I guess Sabrina Silver doesn't understand that ever individual ear is different. How disappointing..."
1,"I wanted an earring that went from my cartilage piercing to my lobe piercing. This is just a cuff that you can put on your cartilage and then connects to a stud. Though it isn't what I originally wanted I am absolutely crazy about this earring! I'm wearing it on the side that my cartilage isn't pierced and it looks great. I will look for more like this, they are really fun without the commitment of another piercing!"
1,"As a simple and perfect wedding band , you cannot pass on this, however watch the size- it does run small"
1,"if your the simple type but you want luxury or luxury is you...then so is this ring...even if luxury doesn't suit you...I GUARANTEE it will LOOK GREAT ON YOU...make sure you pick the right size ring, remember, your wedding finger may be smaller than your right hand, so have it professionally measured. HAPPY SHOPPING...PERFECT BUY...!!"
1,"My wife had a toe ring for years and it broke a few months before Christmas. She didn't expect me to get her another. This $4 toe ring was one of her favorite gifts. The quality and looks were great, especially for the price."
1,I had recieved this as a gift.Lovely item.It made my toes sparkle.very comfortable.I want to get more of them to create the stacking effect
1,"Very pretty, it shines and sparkles in the light weather it be sun or just good lighting!!! The jewels go far enough around the band to cover the whole top of your toe. stays in place and looks good with casual wear or anything dressy!! I would recommend this to a friend."
1,"This is a really nice toe ring. It sparkles when it's on your toe and is really very pretty. It is adjustable, so that is nice. It is very nice and for the price, you just can't go wrong. I would highly recommend buying it. You won't be disappointed."
1,It's so cute I love it!! There's this part on the back though that kind of stabs you but I love it so much that I've learned to ignore it! It's adorable and just what I was looking for.
1,My husband gave me this ring for valentines day this past year and I absolutely adore it. Really great fit to the finger and it's pretty yet simple for every day wear.
0,"They are sharp looking cuff links, but the post broke off on the third use."
0,I bought this ring for my girlfriend as a gift. She loves the look of it. I thought it would be wider though. The problem though is that She's had it for only a day and it stained her finger green like copper does. She has a few other sterling silver rings and none of them stain her fingers colors.
1,Amazon has offered unique and hard to find merchandise. This silver braid ring was so detailed and I was extremely pleased with the delivery time and the price and quality of the ring.
1,Love this ring. It doesn't look like the same old thing you find everywhere. It is made very well.
1,"this is a gorgeous little ring, exactly like the photo and the size was perfect. Love it!"
1,The seller discribed it beautifully. I have gotten nice comments on this ring...it is simple and yet beautiful
1,"I love this ring! I actually should have bought this ring one size bigger because I initially wanted to wear it on my index finger. It felt a little snug, so I ended up wearing it on my middle finger. The width of the ring was just as I expected. It's kinda like an everyday ring for me, so I didn't want anything bulky or wide. It's definitely unique and I've gotten many compliments."
1,I bought this as a gift for my mother for her charm bracelet. She wears it all the time. Sturdy attachment. It has been a couple years and has worn well so far.
1,Just what I wanted. Very pretty and shiny. Perfect for my son's Communion.
1,"I love them very much, nice works guys, exactly in ordered. It's real lovely color and I can wear with my pink bracelet I bought with same this ordered. I will look forward next orders from your site. Thanks and have a wonderful day...!!!"
1,"These earrings are beautiful, elegant and very well made for the price. They are not as long as they look."
1,Have worn my new pearl earrings and get a lot of compliments. The product came as expected and on time. Thank you.
1,"Look great! And, as an added bonus I do not have to worry about losing these because of the clasp finish"
1,Great sale. Love the earrings!!Thanks for offering Swarovski-wonderful crystal-the best crystal in jewelry!!Sparkly and Pretty and just the right length!!
0,not sure whether this si a Swarovski product? Usually there is the logo on the stuff and this earring does not bear the logo. So would you please tell me how to tell this is a Swarovski product?
0,"I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes."
1,I am so happy to have purchased these earrings. They are beautiful and very stylish. They are delicate and should be kept protected.
1,I get more compliments on this simpe little pair of earrings. Everyone should have a pair! These fit great and feel wonderful on.
1,"I love them they are small enough for everyday wear, and people coment on them often about how they like the smaller size and how they have a nice shine to them. I also usally have problems with my ears hurting or getting sore after wearing some earring but not with these and this type of metal defently worth the price!"
1,"Just arrived today, along with the 5mm ones. Both look so beautiful. A nice shiny silver and just the right size. I bought them on sale for 60% off, so it was definitely a good deal!"
1,If you're looking for a great pair of basic posts....these are it! Nice size...not tooo small not too big
1,"I love these. A little small, but they match a bracelet that a friend gave me so I wore it for Christmas. Well made and nice seller."
1,These rings are pretty nice on a ladys finger. Silver but for the price its a steal...
1,"I bought this to wear while travelling in place of my wedding set. I felt much better and I thought the set was very believable, not too big."
1,"I ordered this for my daughter-in-laws birthday. She adored it and it made her whole day, she wore it to work that evening and received many compliments. One happy customer! Delivery was right on time and the picture & description were right on."
1,I got this for my wife as a gift and she absolutely loved it. It is beautiful.
1,"I bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it. It's delicate yet funky, which is exactly my friend. She still gets comments on how beautiful the stone is. The chain is remarkably sparkly. The stone is about the size of a nickel. :-) Not too big, not too small."
0,"I bought this necklace back in 2006 and have worn it everyday ever since. I've wanted to get a replacement because I've accidentally messed it up while trying to clean it. However, the price shot up from being 24 bucks to over 60. I have no idea what these people are thinking, but since they don't even provide a chain anymore (they did back when I bought it!) this isn't a good deal unless the price goes down."
0,"The design is creative and suitable for young ladies.If the color of the string can be brighter, it will be perfect!"
1,I purchase charms for my bracelet for every place that I 'vacation'. I was in Savannah and could not find a charm. I looked on Amazon.com and found this one. It is perfect.
1,"This charm is so very detailed! The workmanship is excellent, and the colors are beautiful."
1,My fiancee loves it. I couldn't ask for more... except maybe a sturdier necklace. She hasn't brought it up though.
1,"Very pretty necklace that looks great with the matching earrings (although it's unfortunate that at the time of this review, the earrings are unavailable). The price is right, too. But be aware, as another reviewer mentioned, that the photo shows the pendant as larger than it actually is. If you like elegant sterling silver jewelry at a great price, you can't go wrong with this necklace."
1,"GREAT NECKLACE!! i got this for my girlfriend on our 6 month anaversary and it worked like a charm. she loved it. its a perfect size, not too big but still noticeable. she wears it about everyday now. clasp in the back seems to be of good quality. very good cheaper necklace, great for those looking for great jewerly without the expensive price. highly recommenced!"
1,What a great deal on a beautiful sterling sliver necklace. Picture is accurate and will make a great gift with the matching earrings.
1,"The chain is thin, like it is on every necklace from the amazon collection, but the pendant itself is wonderful. I purchased the matching earrings and am so pleased with the set. It is very flattering and elegant and personally I like how lightweight the chain is."
1,"Very pretty, hangs good. Comes with a thin chain, but the loop is big enough if you want to use your own, thicker chain.I strongly recommend also getting the complementarySterling Silver Open Filigree Heart Dangle Earrings. Together, these make a great set!Gave both the pendant and earrings to my wife, who loved them."
0,"I want to start out by saying that the price can't be beat. I checked a local jeweler and he didn't have any diamonds this size for less than $850 a pair. However, stones put in white gold settings should have better color than this because of the contrast. The yellowish tint of the diamonds is pretty obvious. I would recommend that you buy a smaller, better-color, stone rather than these."
1,Works really well for all my necklaces and bracelets. Pay attention to the product dimensions. The picture makes it seem smaller than it is.
1,"Works perfectly to store my necklaces and bracelets! I can fit quite a bit on here, yet it still fits well on my small bathroom sink."
1,"This necklace holder is perfect for my necklaces. It is very tall, so even my longer necklaces fit on it. It looks great on my shelf and I couldn't be happier."
1,Ours had no flaws in workmanship and seems sturdy. It does not hold longer neclaces but they can just be double looped.
1,I am a bang for your buck kind of guy. This truly won me points with the wife. She loves them and they are just perfect.
0,"I love cats eye jewelry, so I figured these earrings would be great. I recieved these earrings and was very disappointed. Not only did they look poorly made, but they were HUGE! I don't see how they expect anyone to wear these. I would not recommend these to ANYONE."
1,This ring is absolutely stunning!! It is so beautiful with the stones. I am so happy that I bought this ring. I get many compliments on it.
1,I ordered this for my fiance and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. The ring is shiny silver and is very heavy. It's heavier than rings we had looked at in the jewelry stores. I'm very impressed with it and because it came so fast. I ordered it Wednesday night and received it Friday before noon.
1,love the ring. super simple silver looks great feels great. I highly recommended the seller for this ring.
1,"this charm has the coordinating scripture engraved into the smooth polished back. the seed is well centered, if not exactly in the center. i've seen smaller and larger ones, this size was perfect. it's gorgeous. many people have complimented it but i've never seen anyone else with one."
1,I love having this charm on my bracelet- it's simple and well made. I highly recommend for your Italian charm bracelet if you like yin yang.
1,"I purchased this omega to replace a 16"" that I had to sell while going through a recent divorce. I am very pleased because I paid $400 dollars 4 years ago for a 14k yellow gold omega that was 3mm. This one is larger, heavier by 4 grams, and it is reversible. When I opened the box I could not believe the weight and craftsmanship of this neckpiece. This is truly an heirloom piece of jewelry! If you are on the fence about this one, by all means, jump over and enjoy. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I bought this necklace at ""Today's deal"" price- so love the price for 5mm omega chain. It looks great!!"
1,"This necklace is a Must have!! It is perfect in every way!! You could buy a cheaper one, but it'll never compare to this one, especially in the weight department! Do yourself a favor, stop looking and get this one. Beautiful wooden box, cleaning cloth, everything you need to keep it looking great. Thanks Y'all!!!!"
1,This is very nice. The words are easy to read. It is well made. The person I gave it to loves it!
0,"After our dog ate my mothers day bracelet, my husband offered to replace it. I decided to go simpler and choose this braclet.Now keep in mind that most of the jewelry pictures is no where near as large as it is pictures. This bracelet is delicate and rather light. The toggle clasp is not the best, as it fell off of my wrist several times. I had to take it to the jeweler to have a lobster claw clasp put on in it's place.I can't complain- it is a pretty, simple bracelet. But the clasp is just terrible."
1,"My second time ordering from them..fast shipping, and I love the size of the belly ring I've had lots of people ask where did I get it.........love love love this."
0,"It doesn't look as bold, substantial and shiny as the picture. It's more dull, somewhat like brushed metal, and thinner. Nice ring overall, though. But don't expect too much."
1,I JUST RECEIVED THIS THE OTHER DAY AN ALREADY I'M LOVING IT.JUST ORDERED 2 MORE CHARMS CAN'T WAIT TO GET THOSE. I LOVE REMBRANDT CHARMS.CHARMING IN VA.
1,"I recieved these as a Christmas gift and I love them. I have gotten lots of compliments on them. Good size hoops,not too big and not too small."
0,"This is a very light bracelet and is not suitable for the true jewelry collector. I think it would be great for a kids charm bracelet, but not as a gift to your mother-in-law ;0). I am not educated in the GOLD lingo, so I did not realize how small it was until I received it. After going out and really doing some research, you will need to spend around $200 to get a decent gold bracelet. Just my opinion...but a little more info would have helped me."
1,"This bracelet is just absolutely BEAUTIFUL. It looks great on, and was easy for my jewler to inscribe my daughter's name. She has 7 letters in her name & they all fit just fine. Everyone loves how it looks."
1,"This bracelet is stunning! It is so well made and so believable. With the heart design it's so much more than a typical tennis bracelet. The stones are round cut set inside a cutout heart pattern. You have to see it in person to understand how beautiful it is. The picture does not do it justice at all. This is not the kind of bracelet you'll find on every woman, it has a unique romantic look. The heart design is actually very subtle and classy so this would work for all ages, it's not the least bit cutesy or childish, it's pure elegance. The bracelet also has a great weight to it too, yet it's very comftorable. The double clasp is very sturdy, yet easy to do and undo (unlike many I've had in the past from other jewelers). The price on this is fantastic for what you get and Eve's Addiction has always given me perfect service! I HIGHLY recommend it!"
1,Just what I had been looking for to wear with a butterfly necklace. Icouldn't find earrings like these anywhere else. I love wearing them.
1,"Gave these earring as a gift , and it was loved . Earring looks great on all skin tone ."
0,"the product details are very misleading. I was expecting a better quality product considering the price I paid ( even at the discount price I paid $34.00 including the shipping. The materials are 90% plastic and maybe 10% metal ( unidentified metal) all held together by two strands of what appears to be a mixture of rubber and thread. The feel of it alone reminds of a cheap bracelet you would get out of a 50 cent vending machine, the 10% metal being the cheer charms but the painted skirt, shirt and poms is plastic paint. I can't believe how dissapointed I was in this product, was suppose to be a christmas gift to my niece. I could pay equally this amount on a better quality charm bracelet from Brighton."
1,"This bracelet was what was advertised. Would use this seller again. Good price, fast shipping."
0,"This product, while attractive, could not stand up to remotely normal wear and tear and one day I caught it on something and it completely stretched out and was ruined. I wear bracelets all the time and never saw such a thing. Don't buy it."
1,Charms by Rembrandt are high quality. The diaper charm is just too cute! I bought this for my daughter who just had her 4th child and its one of the cutest baby charms that I have purchased.
1,"Since children grow so quickly, you need a good fit that looks timeless. This pearl jewelry set offers just that!!!And perhaps you could pass it on to another little girl down the road as a flower girl/communion gift once your daughter naturally outgrows the set herself."
1,"Was a gift for granddaughter and she loved it. Call this choice a ""success."" Want to ID her as a Republican early in life!"
1,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous. It is very intricate. The stone is a pale yellow and the cubic zirconias down the side are a nice accent. I loved this one so much, I bought the amythest one as well!! You won't be disappointed."
1,The Sterling Silver 36 Inch CZs by the Yard was a great buy. Thus far I have received several compliments. I am not sure if those complimenting thought the necklace was the real deal. I would recommend this purchase.
1,"I love this piece. It's extremely well made, beautiful, and worth it! I put it on a nice sterling silver chain and it's become a piece of my daily wear. I highly recommend it, but know it's not a tiny piece."
0,"If your looking to get this as a ""birthstone"" gift for someone dont...its way more pink than red. While its a great piece I got it for someone for a birthday present and there birthstone is ruby well that went out the window when it arrived its so pink I honestly dont think they will even know its rubys...unless I tell them. So I dont event know if I will give it to them or return it."
0,"I was pretty disappointed when I saw the product I received. The silver ends on the cord appear very cheaply made and do not look the same as in the picture provided. They are much shorter than what is shown and the piece that fits into the clasp is thicker, making it more awkward to put on and take off. I would not recommend purchasing this, and I'm currently looking into getting another cord to replace this one."
1,"This pendant is better looking in person than what you see. I decided that each of my closest friends will all get a butterfly pendant as a token of our friendship to tell them that where ever they may be, they are never alone. This one looks so elegant and I'm hoping that she'll like it!"
1,I think it looks even better in person then in the picture. I'm quite pleased with it.
0,"I just got my beads today and although they don't match the beads I currently have, I will be able to use them for another project. I must say that I was surprised when I only received 5 beads and the picture advertised 6. Nevertheless, I like the beads."
0,"This was too big and flashy for me. The center stone is big...nice if you have that kind of taste, but I like something a little more understated so that it can be believable."
0,"the pc is 1/8th of screen shot, you need a magnifying glass to read it; if I had had a return slip included in the shipment, I would have returned it."
0,"the earrings was going to be a gift,but it was almost impossible to get just the tag off the earrings w/o bending them-I decided NOT to give them-they broke!"
1,I thought that this product was very good!I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas because he loves watches. He cleaned a very very filthy watch to beautiful condition.Im not sure why the other reviewer had such a bad experience. It came with all the tools that they said it would and the tools were great at cleaning all the little nooks in the watch.I like the foam for cleaning all of my jewelry.
1,Earthy color and symmetrical design are just the ticket. I could wear it every day.
1,"I bought it at Friday sale, It is so beautiful like the picture, very big size, shining. I love it very much. I will give it 5 stars."
1,I bought these for my daughter for a confirmation gift. They were just as described-large and pretty- she wears them alot!!
1,Really thick high quality metal. I gave this to my daughter for a gift anf she loves it! Wears it almost daily. Definitely got the cool mom of the year for this one.
1,These earrings are absolutely beautiful. The diamond accents are tastefully placed to add to a unique appearance. Highly recommended.
1,Earrings arrived in two days and are small but beautiful! The perfect size for everyday wear.Just the right amount of sparkle!
0,This product arrived on time. Unfurtunatly the rosary looks too much like a toy. This product is very fragile. When I bought it I was hoping to get a metal cross that was well defined but this is the complete oposite. Sorry but this product is not worth the money. The provider did a good job with mailing it to me and it arrived in good condition but it is just not worth it. Thanks
0,"I really really want to love this necklace, but I just can't! I feel in love with it the first time I saw it on Amazon. I just loved the style, the color, and everything about it! I been contemplating for over a year to get it (I look at it a few time a month, pondering about getting it. I love it so much, but was a little hesitant to buy jewelry online. I even went onto their website and poke around) and watch the price go from $70 to $80 and then to $90 over the years. I finally crack and bought the necklace as a gift to myself and was super excited for the arrival. Well, lets just say it when downhill when I open up the Amazon box. I provided a few images so other people can see it.... I rarely get work up over a bad purchase, but this really made me upset! I had made countless purchases through amazon for the past few years and only returned two products...this is one of them.The jewelry box was fairly beaten up, with the corners worn out or crushed, which caused the side of the box to bend and curve out (if you look at the right side of the box). I could of overlook the issues, because the detail of the box was so pretty. However, there was a big bright yellow stain next to the necklace when I open the box! I can imagine someone missing the other yellow stain in the box on a time constraint or without a second look, but this one couldn't have been missed. As for the necklace, the pearls were not the lovely and vibrant peach, pink, white, lavender, purple, and grey showed in the picture. The pearl colors were a very flat light peach, cream, metallic grey. The pearls also look rounder and bigger than what it is in the pictures, which is some what deceiving. I notice a couple of the pearls had light scratches on the surface as well. The ""lariat chains"" were also longer than what was shown in the picture, making the necklace look really cheap and the pearls fake. The chain was also made from poor quality material (the quality was similar to children jewelry), which also surprised me. I had bought necklace for $15 with a better chain. As I said earlier... I really wish I could love this necklace, but it's just not happening. The shipment was quick, as I place the order on Sunday and got it on Friday. I gave the product 1 star, because of the beautiful box."
0,"My wife really liked this gift, it looked very cool, but the little swirley dangely thing broke off after a month or two."
1,"It was exactly as promised! The only issue is the shipping delay - once you place the order there's a little bit of a delay before Szul notifies you of the shipping, etc. Kind of nerve-wracking for an expensive purchase."
1,The ring is a bit big inside but the vibrations are strong and do their job. Also fun to make out with. Great accessory! Also comes with an extra battery which is a plus!!
0,Previous comments were about right...it's too big so it doesn't work in his mouth very well but does feel great! The only thing is he can't do it for very long. I don't remember why something about it hitting his teeth I think...so really it feels good but if you only get it for 30 seconds it isn't that worth it.
1,"This is a very pretty ring! The stone is smaller than I expected (Looks a bit larger in photo) but only a tiny bit, so it isn't a problem at all. The color is as shown. The ring is sturdy while still being delicate and the knot detail is very nice. It arrived in an adorable gift box, too. It will make a lovely Christmas gift for my daughter. I am very happy with this ring & the moment I opened the box knew I had selected the perfect gift. I am so happy with it that I will be ordering a second ring."
1,This ring is absolutely beautiful. The price was right and the ring was presented in a gorgeous little gift box.The order came on time. Would give this ring a thumbs up!
1,"So far, I really like this ring. It looks expensive, without the expensive price tag. I am hoping it doesn't turn my finger a weird color! If it doesn't, I plan on buying a few as gifts for my friends!"
1,I love this ring.It is so elegant and beutiful.I been getting so many compliments!!!It looks like antique ring!
1,I reciently lost a ring very much like this one and was searching high and low for another ring to replace the one I lost and came across this ring. This ring is absolutely the most brilliant ring to look at. It shines and sparkels like little Diamonds. I just love this ring. and would reccomend it to anyone who wants a ring that is elegent and afordable at the same time.
1,"I have been looking for marcasite rings. And this one catches my eyes immediately. This ring is very beautiful. The work is very detail. It has a very elegant look. My fingers are thin (size 5), so it's very hard for me to buy rings in store; even if they have my size, the styles don't look good. This one has my size and it looks absolutely shunning! I also bought another ring from Gem Avenue. Both are very beautiful. And they each come with a nice box."
1,"I wear this all of the time. that way I have a beautiful ring on my finger without risking the loss of my diamonds. Thanks, Penelope K. Gonzalez."
1,I love this style of ring. I will show their site a few more times.
1,Loved this ring....would buy it again and again....only you better buy it quick because the price keeps going up and up! I paid $22 for it a week ago....just got it in the mail and it's Beautiful!!!!!
1,"This is a gorgeous ring. Be sure to order a size larger than your ring size because it does come smaller than expected. I was intending to wear it on my middle finger, but instead had to wear it on my right hand ring finger. It is simply stunning. I have returned to order the crown ring as well, two actually, one for myself for my pinky and one for my 16 year old daughter for her pinky. She nearly took my finger off trying to take this one."
1,"This ring is beautiful and delicate. I absolutely love the way it shines. If you're worried about it looking cheap because of the price, don't worry, it catches peoples eyes that's how pretty it is."
1,"I absolutely love this locket! For the scented part, I use a small piece of felt and spray perfume on it. Great size, not gaudy but not so tiny you can't put something in it."
1,"I was truely amazed at the quality of the workmanship, I have seen many in the stores and was depressed.... but I look for quality and detail to things and was never impressed until now...... this armoire is exquisite!!!!! my beloved grandmother would improve infact it reminds me of her bedroom outfit..... thank you ever so much I will cheerish it always...... truely a magmificent armoire that i'd be proud to hand down after i'm gone......"
1,I got this ring for my 17 yr old son and he loves it. It is very detailed and well made.
0,"Ring arrived as promised, but did not fit. Seller did not reply to repeated requests for return. Make sure you get what you want, because you won't be able to return it!"
1,I ordered this for my sister because it was on her Amazon wish list. It came with an adorable gift box and the quality of it was great. It was so pretty that I even thought about keeping it for myself!
1,"These earrings ARE small and very thin. I have 4-5 pairs of them, because I have my ears pierced multiple times, and do you know how HARD it is to find small earrings of HIGH quality, that you can leave in for years at a time, and which do not only NOT get tarnished or dirty, but are completely comfortable to sleep in? Most small hoops are too thick to be comfortable at the top of my ears, or have an annoying back. Anyway, if you have an infant, or if you have multiple ear piercings, these things are great to keep in for extended-wear. They look elegant and FEEL GREAT. And they never accidentally come off. Or cause the infections that can occur with silver earrings. I have these at the tops of my ears and I can't even feel them when I sleep. I usually forget I'm wearing earrings at all. I love these and want and endless supply of them."
1,This is a beautiful hockey goalie charm. It has a nice finish and nice hockey goalie mask details.great for any hockey fan and makes a nice gift.
1,"At 58 years old, this is my first birthstone ring ... and I am DELIGHTED! I was actually jumping up and down in my seat when I opened the box. It is lovely and was in a cute bag with a little bear as a plus!! This is just an awesome, dainty, beautifully colored Aquamarine White Gold Ring. SUPER!"
1,"My husband bought this set for me after 3 years of being married. The set is absolutely gorgeous. The diamonds are small, but the ring would look strange if they were any bigger. I love this set."
0,The diamonds are not the same quality as the photo.They are more cloudy in the main stone the ones on the bands are a little clearer. I saw the same set at Kmart.I am disappointed in the clarity.
1,"I have several piercings in each ear, and wanted 14k horseshoes in a smaller size for the upper holes. These are perfect! I saw the same earrings in other stores for much more. Great deal!"
0,"I have two of these Contico tool box. The first one I had lasted a long time. It is light and cheap. Made out of plastic, so easy to haul around. The handle on the top is not really necessary. Because if ure toolbox is full and heavy, the handle will break off. Don't expect too much from this toolbox, as it is not rugged, but it sure beats carrying around a bucket or box w/o wheels.The new one I ordered from Amazon is the same box & handles. The color is reversed. Yellow for the base and black for the cover (as pictured). The old one, the colors were vice-sersa. The wheels are now some sucky wheel that does not fit well. It makes the tool box wobbly when rolling it around. I had to change it out with lawn mower wheels bought separately from Home Depot.Suggestion to manufacturer"
0,If you wear these with socks LOOK OUT they got caught on a sock and the anklet can't be fixed. I'm mot a happy camper
1,"This is a beautiful blue inlaid opal bead. It is bigger than the average bead. It is so pretty that it and the others similar to it garner compliments all the time. Sabrina Silver makes several others in different colors that go with it/or complement it.Sterling Silver, Pink Lab Opal Inlay Pandora Type Barrel Bead Pendant w/ CZ stones, 3/8"" (9mm)"
1,"I bought this to wear a pendant on, but it is so pretty that I've been wearing it by itself. I notice people in stores staring at it. I bought the 18"", and I'm going to order more in longer lengths. Can't beat the price."
0,"The ring was cute. They dont turn the ring around to show you that the design does not go all the way around. Seller was pretty prompt with shipping it. Though I do not suggest buying from them as a gift for someone. Their sizing is off, so make sure you check it when you get it. (I ordered a size 9 and got a size 8)"
1,"The earring were very nice, but unfortunately, the shipping costs were ridiculous. I wish I had realized that before I made the purchase, but it was bundled with other items and I just let it slide."
1,"Wonderful quality. Looks exactly like the picture shown. Good sterling silver, very illustrious stones. Great buy."
1,This Ring is very true to the picture. It is very pretty and not too big on the finger
1,I was looking for glass double flared plugs and thats exactly what I got. It was shipped fast and packed nicely. There's absolutely nothing to complain about. Great quality product and service.
1,"When I got this it was ridiculously shiny, almost to the point I did not want to wear it. Fortunately, it got to a more friendly silver color over the next couple weeks. Seems durable and looks good with just about anything. Price was nice as well."
1,This rope chain is perfect for hanging a pendant on. It's comfortable to wear and is bright and shiny. I love it!
0,This necklace turned black after a few months. Now the outside is black and the inside is still shiny so it looks like it has zebra stripes.
0,was very heartbroken with this product to small not a well made at all wish i would have sent it back
1,"I picked these up for my Daughter as a reward. The quality was excellent and with the price being so afforsable there is no hardship if they are lost. Great item, excellent price, Big smiles from the little one."
1,This looks just like my first mommy van and thats why I bought it. To remind me of those first big buys all in the name of family. Quality craftsmanship.
1,"I really like these earrings. They match everything, and are very cute, but not really long (for people like myself who don't like the really long earrings). I wear them all the time."
1,"colors are remarkable and the light shines through them. No backs, so I lost one, but then re-ordered--now I'll have three!"
1,I love this necklace. I have gotten so many compliments on it. I would buy from the company again!
1,"This necklace did not disappoint. It had a ideal cut that reflects light wonderfully for the glimmer you love to see especially on a sunny day.I gave this as a gift to my fiance and she loved it. Not to mention it had free shipping to boot. This made a great present, plus NETAYA and amazon gave me great updates so I knew the delivery was prompt along the way."
1,I LOVE this necklace!! It is the perfect size! It's large enough to really get noticed but not so big that it looks gaudy. I also love that it's so versatile. I can wear it with jeans and a shirt or with a nice dress out to dinner. I get tons of compliments on this necklace and wear it all the time!
1,"I was very skeptical about buying jewlery online, however, my daughters 18th Birthday is coming up and I had been searching the stores for months for a Birthstone necklace. I couldn't find anything that was unique or worth what they were asking for it. I saw this necklace, ordered it, and I love it! The quality is very nice and the piece is a beautiful and unique. I couldn't be happier and can hardly wait to give it to her!"
1,As with the other six charms - perfect and securely wrapped on arrival in NZ. Will be purchasing more charms.
1,i looked at alot of star of david and none appealed to me until i saw this one. the sterling silver is nice and so is the chain
0,"I received this product as a gift and within days the ""silver"" coating wore off exposing cheap metals, which ended up infecting my ear. Originally these were intended to be used as a nose stud (as the description claims they can be used as) which is not true at all. Nose studs DO NOT have an earring back. Trying to wear this as a nose stud is painful and unsanitary. This product is NOT made of sterling silver. Avoid this product if cheap metals irritate your skin!"
1,"I ordered these on Thursday and received them on Monday. Not only was the service great, but the earrings were exactly what I had been looking for but could not find. Perfect for my multiple ear piercings!"
1,I had this wish listed and my parents bought it for me. The back is smooth and the bail is solid. The marcasite stones are evenly set in the silver. It's as good as it looks in the listing.
0,"I was looking for a themed gift for the flowergirl in my garden wedding. I got the bridesmaids peridot jewelry, so this necklace seemed a natural choice. It's a great bargain for 14kt and semi-precious, but you get what you pay for. It's exremely small and the heart is thin and appears very easily breakable. The join between the heart and its hanger also looks pretty weak. I am going to advise her parents to take extra care with the handling of this piece.The peridot, however, looks perfect- nice and bright and a decent size."
1,"Make sure you realize this is a small item, but very crafted."
1,"I heard the story of St Brigid years ago, my first visit to Ireland. My last trip I looked for it in sterling silver and couldn't find it. I can't believe I found this on Amazon. The cut is precise and just a perfect size. I bought a 20"" chain as well and they are perfect together. A great buy!"
1,"The item was shipped almost immediately and I got it within the week - in perfect time to use it for Imbolc! Also, it was in perfect condition and beautiful. Thank you so much!"
1,My favorite celtic pendant! Just the right size and made of good quality. I get compliments every time I wear it.
1,"I received this as a present from my girlfriend. It's a very well designed piece and, as others have noted, it is very solid. It did not come with a chain, but we put it on a heavier silver chain with its own Celtic design."
1,"Gave this to my 18 year old daughter to go with her ""clubbing"" outfit. The unusual shape adds to it's beauty. Im very glad i bought this and wish i had gotten another rather than the mother of pearl and onyx one."
1,"Well, this made my mother's day during her birthday. She always wanted cross-shaped earrings and she could never find them, and I just found precisely what she was looking for, for she was really excited with them. They are sterling silver and have some ""minerals"" (marcasite) encrusted on them. They are small yet nice-looking. Highly recommend them."
1,"I just bought this bracelet for my 3 month old. It is such a pretty little bracelet and durable. I have not taken it off even though they say to, and I have no worries of it breaking. I highly recommend this bracelet, perfect little girl gift."
1,I bought this ring to go with a princess cut pendant and earrings. It complimented them beautifully. It is very delicate and can be worn everyday if you so desire.
0,"It's a beautiful necklace. It only has one problem. The popcorn chain is linked securely to the fixed U shaped station. I wore it every day and after the 5th day it just fell off from around my neck. There is too much pressure on those fixed connection points, and the chain just can't take it. Also, this is a completely enclosed bezel diamond, so there was really not much shine coming from it, since no light can get thru from underneath.So, if you are going to wear it here and there, it's a great choice. It's very beautiful, but if you intend to wear it every day, it's not going to work out for you.( I actually bought it when it was $225 bucks, I see the price dropped to $180. )"
1,This necklace was a big hit with my wife. She loves it. I was very impressed when I opened the box. Subtle beauty without breaking the bank.
1,"All things considered, I ignored the review and decided to purchase this item and is indeed happy with it. For $69, I can put aside my prized solataire from my husband and wear this necklace as an everyday item. I am in agreement that the design does not allow for much light to the diamond, however, the overall design of the necklace makes up for this bit of flaw. It has the appearance of an estate piece. I layer it with my Tiffany ""tag"" necklace and my co-workers has complimented me more on this necklace. I will keep the other design issues reported by previous buyers in mind, but so far, I am content with my decision."
1,"I cannot describe how pleased I am with this product, it looks way better in person, it has a tremendous quality and seems to be much more expensive!. My husband and I bought this as an alternative ring to wear at work, but honestly I like it better than my original set. If you buy it you'll be 100% satisfied. If you have trouble with the size, the seller is great at exchanges, just one time at no cost, and they are fast delivering the rings to you. Buy it and you won't regret! thanks Sabrina silver =]"
1,"I love this ring. Since I work on my car alot. My gold ring got beat up quickly. This ring looks better than my 18k ring, is very durable, and always looks great. I recommend this to all who love the comfort fit and who is tough on wedding rings. Perfect for newly weds. If I was to do it all over again I would have bought this ring over my original gold wedding ban. Very happy with it and get several great comments."
1,"The rings are beautiful, The pictures do not do the rings justice. We ordered the rings and expected to wait 10 days before we got the rings, instead we received the rings in 7 days, used standard Shipping since did not need by a specific date. The rings are more beautiful and a little heavyer than expected but once I got used to the weight every thing is perfect. I can not believe the cost, high cost Jewlery Store Quality at a bargin rate, I will definately be shopping Sabrina Silver again!!!!!"
0,"I purchased this ring for my husband for our 5 year anniversary last year. It looked great, was comfortable and fit well. Almost a year to the day I ordered it he called me at work to tell me that it had broke. It is now in two pieces. It is so bizzare because it broke it two perfact halves. I can't complain too much since I paid under $50 for it, but I thought it would last more than one year."
1,Sorry for the late review but we are about to celebrate our 3rd anniversary and the ring is as beautiful as the day I received it. My husband loves it. It is very comfortable & durable!!! Thank you!
0,The chain is pretty cheap and only a simple round ring holds the heart on the chain. The heart is smaller than I thought it would be (my fault for not really paying attention to the details).I may put it on a nicer chain or even on a charm bracelet given it's size. The Mother-of-Pearl material is very pretty so I won't be wasting this purchase.
0,"As costume jewelry goes, it's perfect. Too bad you'll be spammed to death by Pugster after just one order."
1,"This piece is a great bargain as it is quite beautiful. I have only worn it a few times and don't know how long the satin will hold up. However, that is an easy fix and for the price you can't go wrong."
0,"Product is tiny, much smaller than I expected. This was an impulse buy and had I researched a little more on the net I could have found this medal for half the price. But it is what it is, and it is small, but well made and nice looking, just order a magnifying glass at the same time."
1,These earrings are beautiful. You won't go wrong. I got these earrings and I absolutely love them. They are easy to put on too. Major plus!
1,"I bought this matching set as a gift for my wife. I had never heard of Dahlia, but it turned out to be everything that I had hoped it would. I will do business with them again."
1,These earrings do have a bit of fire in them and are definitely noticeable. They are comfortable to sleep in as well as talk on the phone with. Highly recommend.
1,I was looking for a pair of swarovski earrings for my 9 year old niece as a Christmas gift. She wanted something dangly and I liked these because they are very lightweight and not too big or fancy. The star design is cute but not too childish as the crystals are sparkly and very pretty (in fact I would wear these myself). The gold color of the crystal is much lighter in person than the picture shows but we loved it anyway.
1,"When I opened the box this chain was so much prettyer then the pictures. I wanted something masculin for my fience for christmas, but I didn't have that much money to spend. Not only was this in my price range but I loved it and so did he. I recommend this to anyone who wants to look good!"
0,ive gotten better out of a gumball machine the necklace fit around my neck with like an inch to spare its tiny not masculine at all worst buy off amazon but shipping was nice thats about it
1,"I have a hard time finding chains more than 30 inches . This chain was 36 inches and perfect for me ! Well made ,nice weight to it . will order from this company again!"
1,It's sexy. I received a great deal of compliments and attention from strangers and co-workers alike. Well worth the purchase.
1,"My earrings hasn't faded!! I like these size, I which there was bigger size of this same style like a 2 1/2 or 3 but anyway the purchase came quickly. Satisfied customer, would recommed seller, b/c I have purchase from them before."
0,The thin piece of wire that inserts into the hoop for closure broke the first time I attempted to put on the earrings. Disappointing and a waste of money.
1,"Got this for my wife as a present, she loves it. If you've got one of those special girls who is into fun geeky stuff like fantasy, Tolkien, D&D, etc - this makes a nice present."
1,This necklace is very beautiful and intricate - a very unique piece of jewelry. I rarely take it off and it's held up nicely. Worth the money!
1,"The product, and price are awesome!!! A beautiful tree of life charm, with necklace!!! Extremely fast shipping!!! The only problem was choosing one from all the beautiful ones!!!"
0,"What is the old saying, you get what you pay for. This bracelet is too small and cheap looking. This is good for a little girl about six or seven years old."
1,I got really quick. less then a week. It surprised me cause it was just before just before christmas and I didn't think it would get here before the new year but it came 2 days before christmas. The best thing is that I can wear it and I am really sensitive to anything that isn't real and this is my first time wearing anything thats overlay but happy to say no problems wearing it.
1,It came a day early from what the receipt said. Fits perfect on my wrist buy first glance it is kinda small. For only 1.99 I thought it would have tarnished by now but ive had it on for about a week in the shower and everything and it still shines like brand new!! Great buy!!
1,"I recived the package three days early which made me very happy. I ordered this as a gift for my grandmother to give to her on Christmas. At first I thought that it was to small, but then I tried it on my mother and it fit fine. I am also very happy that it came inside of a cute little white draw bag, so I don't even have to wrap it!"
1,"I bought these earrings to replace a gold pair I had some years ago. I've been searching for this style for a long time, and everything I'd looked at before was either really cheap looking or way too expensive. These earrings are dainty, and feminine. They're quite pretty. I wear them quite a bit."
1,love these earrings..get so many compliments on it.remember you get wat you pay for.
1,"The best way to describe this product is that I just ""love it!"". I wear it often..it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. It is well crafted and seems to hold up very well. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a smiliar piece. I am sure you won't be disappointed."
0,"This item looked great on the computer, once it arrived it looked like it came from a gum ball dispenser. Very flimsy, and thin. The design is beautiful, but the quality is not there."
1,A pretty way to dress up any stud earring! I like them with my diamond and pearl studs. I also felt they were a good value.
1,Recently I purchased the rare White Buffalo turquoise earrings for my daughter-in-law who is native American. She was very pleased with them and has been wearing them daily. They hold special significance to her almost as a religious icon. I had been looking for some time for a special gift. Thank you.
1,"It is rather heavy wich gives it a very real feel. It isn't some fake plastic thing. Very durable, I hang it in my car and it gets whacked by a lot of things and it is still intact. I love pirates of the carribean!"
1,I bought this necklace to complete my Elizabeth Swann Costume (my husband was Jack Sparrow). It looks exactly like the one in the movie! It is heavy (solid) and I got lots of complements on it! Loved it!
0,"It was just what he wanted (he loves the movies) but chain broke right away. Fixable, but still...."
0,"I ordered this thing just for fun, but I gave it to a friend for a graduation gift because it wasn't what I was looking for.Pros"
1,I thought it was going to be a tiny thing but it is a nice size. You can wear as a joint ring also. Nice.
0,Just received this product and will be returning. It is so small it will only fit a child. Not happy at all.
1,"I am so pleased with this elephant charm! It's so cute and it looks exactly like it does in the picture. I wear it all the time. It came very quickly too, and in a lovely package."
0,"I know the description said 1/4"", but I didn't expect it to be so small. You can barely notice it around my husband's neck, but he loves it!The quality is pretty good."
1,Our 4 year old granddaughter loved this gift. She played with it constantly after Christmas. It was a gret gift choice for her. Seems as if it will hold up well.
1,the music box arrived perfectly packaged....everything worked and my 3 1/2 yr old grandaughter loved it....any little girl would love it!
0,"I purchased the ballerina jewelry box for my granddaughters, and they were entranced and delighted to see the little ballerina spin to the tune of the music. It is constructed of heavy paperboard, and will probably not hold up as well as if it were constructed of wood. This ""toy"" is not one that is meant to be played with in the traditional sense of the word play, but is to be enjoyed for the lovely artwork and the sweet music it plays."
0,"I SO want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box. It's gorgeous! The cunning little drawers! The sweet, soft ballerina paintings! It plays Swan Lake! But, oops, it DID play Swan Lake. The wind up mechanism broke after only a few days, and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent. My little girl still likes it, and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes, but I wish it were more durable."
1,"I bought these for my wife as a ""birth"" gift for our second child. I was very skeptical as I have never seen an I3 diamond, which is the bottom of the scale. When I first received the diamonds, I was VERY impressed. The cut, color and clarity at first glance were excellent. Below are my observations, but keep in mind that I am an informed consumer but not a gemologist.First, the cut was fine. I didn't break out calipers or anything but it looked symmetrical to me and I'm a professional engineer.The color was colorless as I was not able to see any hint of yellow. ""J"" is the last letter on the near colorless scale.The size was excellent!! Think about it, each diamond is about 3/4 carat which is amazing considering the price.Now, the clarity is fine from about 1 foot away or more. The diamonds I received were clear looking, not cloudy. The reason they are I3 was that each diamond had a feather that you could see with your naked eye. You really have to look for them, but when you find them they are noticeable. At least you know they are real. Keep in mind that when your wife is wearing them, 99.9% of most people will never see diamond earrings that close and will not be able to see the flaws. If they do, you have bigger problems.Overall, they sparkle very well, even when I brought them to the jewelry store and compared them to better quality diamonds. You have to ask yourself, does size really matter? I opted for size instead of clarity, especially because they are earrings.UPDATE"
1,Exactly what I expected. Smooth surface and very elegant without being over the top. The simple colors match most suits!The pearl is grainier than you might think as it appears to be a clear white line in the picture. The lapus also has tiny flakes of gold.
1,"I bought this for a charm bracelet - my only complaint is that I wish the jump ring was on a corner instead of on the top of the cube, but otherwise I love it."
0,"I wore them often (maybe once a week), but still. Tried to super glue them, but didn't work."
1,I purchased the Silver Cameo Ring from Palm Beach Jewelry for my wife as a Christmas gift. I must say she loves it!
0,"It's pretty, but like most cheap jewelry, mine broke after the first few wears...go for quality."
1,This charm is beautiful and unique because the top of the skate is open. Very cute!
1,"I wanted to write this review after I had the ring for a while because it is really important to me that the shine lasts. Well, it has! I do not wear the ring everyday so there still is a chance for wear and tear but it still shines as much as the day I received it in the mail. The ring came on time and was in simple packaging, so if I was giving the ring as a gift I might wrap it in something different, but the red garnet is dark and intense and the sterling silver is sturdy and glamorous. I don't like chunky rings and this one is petite and delicate looking but not in a way that is looks like it is going to break. I love my birthstone and this rings allows me to appreciate the color. I would recommend this to any January birthday."
1,the stone shines so beautifully under sunlight. the ring appears exactly as shown in the picture but the stone is so much more alive and is a deeper red than is seen here.
1,I got the genuine garnet ring hoping tht it was a nice as it looked in the picture. It is perfect. Nice quality and nice color.
1,I bought this ring for my daughter last year. I was looking for birthday gift ideas and noticed I did not write a review. My daughter loves this ring. She has worn it every day and there has not been any damage. Worth EVERY penny. I hope I find another excellent gift this year.
1,"They were a bit smaller than I would have hoped, but they weren't for me and my friend adored them! Well worth the price, considering how inexpensive they are!"
1,"I bought these for my Mother for Mother's day...along with several other things...for earrings she could wear everyday. Lightweight, go with anything, but eyecatching. Anyone who has a nickel allergy knows that some earrings make your ears sore or itchy...some times they're the ones you love and you've just worn them a bit too long. In order to keep your piercings open you need to wear something light to give your ears time to rest and heal. These are perfect!"
1,Beautiful necklace at an unbeatable price. I gave it to my gf for Valentines day and she absolutely loved it!
1,"also one of my favorite. the idea of nice cute little coloured stones in it, the sound of them when you move. I dedicated each stone to a person of my family I love. thanks a lot"
1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE SHE LOVES IT SO FOR THAT IT GETS 5 STARS. O AND IT DOSE LOOK A LOT BETTER THAN THE PIC
1,"Awesome! could not have been better.. just what i wanted, exactly as picture showed, have no complaints or problems with it"
0,"It scratched my belly button up, and it mad my belly button itch really bad. I wouldnt buy this ever"
1,My new diamond ear rings exceeded my expectations. I use them frequently and get a lot of compliments.
1,"I bought 5 of these in different colors for my Wife, aside from the bar being just a little too long for her (she had a shorter one to use) she absolutely loves them and switches them out to coordinate better with her mood and outfit. If there were more colors available, especially black, I would buy them all!"
1,I ordered these earrings for my wife's birthday. They showed up in two days with no problem. The quality of the diamonds was higher than advertised on the site. I picked these diamond studs for a couple of reasons - the value was great and the prong design was much prettier than the standard prongs I see on most diamond earrings. I prefer the white gold to platinum as the platinum (while stronger) loses its luster much more quickly than gold. The 1.5 ct tw earrings I purchased are very large on her ear and are a noticable difference from the 1 ct tw (1/2 each ear) that most of her friends have. And it didn't hurt that they were $215 less than comparable earrings at Blue Nile.
0,"I purchased this ring to go with my very pretty blue topaz earrings. The ring looks very nice, but the stone color is not like any of my blue topaz jewelry, more like a VERY light aquamarine, almost white! I am going to keep it anyway because it is a lovely ring and the price was right, but the picture is a misrepresentation, therefore only 3 stars."
0,"cheap cheap cheaply made. and the stones are definately NOT blue, more like a dull gray"
0,I ordered the Blue Topaz 7-Stone Ring. I got a cubic zirconia type stone...It was NOT blue. I don't like the white stone and didn't order it.
0,i WILL NEVER ORDER ANOTHER PIECE OF JEWELRY FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN. I NEVER REICEIVED MY BRACELET AND IT WAS FOR AN IMPORTANT DAY. I DID NOT GET MY MONEY REFUNDED AND I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER BACK ON HOW I CAN GET IT REFUNDED. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND I'M STILL UPSET.
1,I purchased very similar diamond earrings for $800 more than the price on Amazon.com. Amazing value and I will certainly be using Amazon for my future jewelry needs.
0,"I recieved my order and was extremely upset. As clearly indicated on the website I was to receive a Diamond grading report along with the earrings but it was never sent. I called customer service which has been outsourced to some developing country where english is definitely a second language and some person with only rudimentary English tried to help me but proved utterly useles. Finally called another number and got someone in Canada. He spoke English just fine so I can't complain about him. Unfortunately, in order to get th eGrading Report that was prmised from the start I have to send the entire package back in order for them to send me a whole new package whcich contains the earrings with the Grading Report. Of course, the item is now ""currently out of stock"" and nothing is available and meanwhile it's only two weeks 'till Christmas!! Seems like major BS if you ask me. They said I should go appraise this product myself at a local gemologist which means I' will incur additional costs of which Amazon is willing to cover a part of. LESSON LEARNED"
1,Pendant is a lovely size and design. I was going to give it away as a gift but have been complimented so often that I decided to keep it for myself.
1,I bought these for my toddler because they have screw back closure that is difficult to remove (as she constantly removed all her other earrings). So far she wasn't able to take them off and eventually she left them alone. The earrings are very pretty.
1,I got this ring as a gift and it was perfect. She loved it and gets complements on it constantly. The size and shape are great.
1,5 stars for this adorable ring. Arrived quickly and in great condition. Purchased one for a friend and one for myself as friendship rings. She loved it as much as I.
1,"I absolutely LOVE my earrings, purchased for an extremely reasonable price, and delivered as fast as humanly possible! I would recommend this seller to everyone, they have an excellent business! :)"
1,Great value for Lapis chips. Stones are nice colored and look nice.Delicate with small chips. Inexpensive little gift for someone or yourself.
1,"I bought these to match a blue agate cameo and they matched perfectly. The earrings are light and super cute. I love them. They are casual, but not too casual to pair with my cameo and a nice outfit. These will be worn with jeans, too!LOVE THEM! I would even purchase them in other colors, too. I'm picky, so if I was satisfied, you will be, too!THANKS AMAZON!"
1,"This is a stunning piece of jewelry, at a terrific price. The length is perfect for wearing with a v-neck top. I've gotten many compliments on this necklace."
1,I loved the design I bought the citrine and peridot versions as well. A bit smaller than I would like but color good and well worth the price.
1,This is an elegant ring with sterling band and beautiful color. The stone is like pink ice with a little purple. It's just gorgeous! What a great buy too!
1,"You will not be disappointed. This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous, when the light hits it, it just sparkles. Very pretty detail and high quality made. Approximately 6-7mm in width. I'm going to get so much pleasure from wearing this bracelet. I am very happy with this purchase and seller shipped item out fast. This bracelet is worth every penny I spent on it and more :)"
1,I have large wrists and yet this dainty delicate bracelet fit and made me feel girlie. It is elegant and looks to be of a high quality stone and made so well. I can't believe how inexpensive it was! I will treasure this. I highly recommend this bracelet. It came in a great little bag too.
1,"when i first got it i was so happy that i bought it, the box was very nice , and the bracelet itself is much more beautiful in person than it was online. it is a work of art, the flower is very pretty and the colors are so vivid. the ajusting part seems very strong too, and it work very well, worth every penny."
1,This bracelet looks better in person than it does in the picture. The craftsmanship is wonderful and the flowers seem very secure. I'd buy from them again in a heartbeat!
1,"I cannot say enough about this piece, it's simple and beautiful. I have a small wrist so this draw string type of closure was right up my alley. Simple Elegance, if you are looking for that....then you found it!"
1,I was shopping for a Tiffany necklace when I ran across this one.... at a fraction of the cost and just as pretty I was pleased when it arrived and was the quality it is! I odered several items from Eve's Addition and I was very pleased with the quality of each item.Shop away and I promise you will be pleased!
1,"Bought for myself on a whim while purchasing a gift to avoid paying freight ;-) Very pretty, great price. Included nice gift box."
1,I ordered this choker and it is absolutely beautiful and it fits pretty good and im a big guy too!! Lol but if you are looking for something that looks good and will fit and stay i reccommend coming to roger enterprises they know EXACTLY what they are doing when it comes to creativity
0,"For a small single bracelet, it is sweet. The color is very pale, I wish it were brighter, but it still is sweet."
0,"The bracelet was cute, however the packing was terrible. The bracelet almost fell out of the box when I received it. Also, it was not long enough. I feel like I overpaid for this product."
1,"This wedding band was identical to one I purchased on Blue Nile, but it was $100 less, even with the Blue Nile ring sizer discount. The band looks good and has a decent quality and craftsmanship.(2yr. update 2/27/09"
1,I really like the earrings. They are the perfect size for my second ear piercing & they catch people's attention when I wear them. Davina Martin
0,"My dad had ordered this for me not once but twice and the product never came! It looks beautiful and something I would thoroughly enjoy since Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. I wish I could provide a better review, but no product to effectively review. Thoroughly disappointed with this seller. My dad felt bad about not having this for me for Christmas, and I felt bad for him because he really tried to deliver. I am an avid amazon customer and of the hundred items I have bought, this is the first and hopefully only poor review I will write."
1,This was the first time I had purchased jewelery online and I can say I am very impressed. The quality and finish of the ring is excellent and the diamond is nicer than I expected in this price range. I especially like the tone of the 14k white gold over the 10k and that is uncommon with this stone size and price range.
1,I bought this ring as a wedding band for my husband last spring. He has been wearing it for over a year now and it still looks great!
1,The price on this was much cheaper than I was able to find anywhere else. The size was perfect. I'm very pleased with it.
1,"I bought this ring and I am very happy with it. It is very pretty and you will not be disappointed. I am a very picky individual and if I am happy with something, trust me on it."
1,It's a nice piece of fashion jewelry and looks pretty nice if you are wearing a full white outfit. The price wasn't bad either.
0,"These earrings are very tiny, nothing what you would think from the picture, and I guess you get what you pay for. I bought them for my daughter who thought she was going to use them in her tragus piercing, but they are way too small so she just uses them in her upper cartlidge piercing instead."
0,"I am very unhappy with the quality of Rembrandt charms. I found this particular one pathetic in both its ""charm"" and the lack of substantial sterling silver for the price (it is so tiny you might not notice it). Look elsewhere, folks, I am sending mine back."
0,"Placed order but wasn't able to review or track it afterwards. Seller's Amazon name (Old Glory) not the same as emailed notification name (Red Rocket Merchandising Corporation). Items (2 rings) arrived quickly in a plastic envelope. Items not exactly as pictured and not comparable to my existing ring. Competitive pricing compared to retail stores but I guess ""you get what you pay for""."
1,"Didn't take too long to get here, exactly what I thought it would be"
1,"The product and service were outstanding! The product arrived on time and the pearls were of excellent quality. Ladies, I would recommend this as a perfect gift to yourself, and gentlemen...this is a great gift for that special someone."
1,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, 2008. They absolutely surpassed my expectations! They are indeed flawless and BEAUTIFUL! Even the packaging is drop dead gorgeous! I HIGHLY recommend these as an exquisite gift, the color, the shape, the quality of the pearls are just beautiful. You WILL NOT be disappointed....and no I am NOT a paid spokesman, I don't even play one on TV I am just a very grateful Mom who wants you to know that I am VERY satisfied with this purchase."
1,"I purchased these pearls to wear for my wedding. I needed a just slightly off-white color, as my dress was a 'soft white' rather than pure white. Let me say first that I was blown away by the great customer service from this company. They worked with me to match the color of the pearls that were on my dress, and were very kind and willing to help. They let me return a set that wasn't quite the right color for me, along with a pearl bead from my dress, and then they sent me a new set that was their closest match to the bead. GREAT GREAT GREAT to work with. I was very thankful.The pearls ended up working perfectly. I was VERY pleased with the color, weight, quality, and feel of the pearls. They just feel good to touch and wear!! In addition, I love the silver flower-shaped clasp on the bracelet and necklace. It works well and feels secure. I ended up buying an inexpensive pair of earrings to go with them because I wanted something that dangled, but am still glad to have the simple earrings that came with it as well. I loved wearing this for my wedding, and still love wearing it for various occasions throughout the year. These will be something that I will cherish and always enjoy wearing."
1,"I bought these as a gift for my wife to wear on our wedding day, not only did she look gorgeous but she was quite fond of these pearls to boot!"
1,"I love these pearls! They are slightly bigger than what I expected, so I have to get over the feeling I'm wearing my mother's pearls, if you know what I am saying. They do look beautiful though and make quite a statement."
1,"I bought this set as a gift for my daughter. She loved it! It's a very nice and classy set. Pearls are white and bright, nicely shaped, not to big or too small, exactly what I was looking for. Delivery was faster than expected. Overall, very pleased with this product and this company."
1,A very pretty and not as often seen Celtic knot design. Love the detail put into it. Arrived the first day of the estimated delivery time. Love to wear them with my other Celtic jewelry that I have collected over the years. A very happy and satisfied customer!
1,We really loved working with this company. The Gold and Diamond Source turned out to be real people who really cared about helping me get the package and the best product on time. Plus my husband loved the medal great quality. If I had the money I would buy gold from them over and over and over. WOW I could just spend the day buying quality gold from this Source. Trust them.
1,Just received this pendant and I have to say that it is impressive! The size is substantial and there is alot of detail in the design. Can easily be seen from a distance. The sterling silver has an oxidized appearance and is of substantial weight. It is a sturdy piece and one that you will not see coming and going on everyone! I love it! Could easily be priced higher. A real bargain!
1,Item just as beautiful in person as it is in the picture. Great craftsmanship and design!
0,"Bought this charm for my daughter, it lasted one day before a trip to the jeweler, then a day after the trip to the jeweler the top sheared off so there is no ring to attach it to the bracelet. I paid for expedited shipping to make sure it was here a few days before the big day, and the day before the big day I was sweating till it arrived. Not a happy camper, the service was sub par and the charm itself left me frustrated and my daughter without a charm."
0,"Yeah, it looks nice, but it could be as big as Diana Ross's eyeballs!!!cm?mm?Description old glory...come on! This is the internet. Be descriptive."
1,"Bought it for my partner and he has had literally dozens of compliments on it. It's a bit large, so better for a man. The workmanship is wonderful and the white gold adds class to it all."
1,Purchased to add to the front of our wedding album. It is a perfect match to the stamp we purchased. It is a little heavier than your standard charm. Just perfect for our needs.
0,"the item i received was distorted and not fit to wear,it was ripped on the bottom right hand side of the ring(top) it was not fit or safe to wear.it would've cut my finger. i sent it back ,have not heard from them yet i asked for a creit back to my account."
1,"I bought it for a friend with beautiful blue eyes; the brooch fits her just wonderfully. And, besides, it is very elegant."
0,"very nice ring on the outside, but the inside of the ring does not reflect the same craftsmanship on the outside. No one will see the inner surface of the ring when it on someone`s finger but it does deflate the overall satisfactions of the product. The price of the ring is very favorable and if it was made from a more expensive metal and had this quality of work put it, i will truly be disappointed but at this price, I have little room to complain. you get what you pay for and i do enjoy it."
1,Finally! A ring that looks EXACTLY like the picture and is a very cool piece that gets lots of compliments. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
0,"This isn't a bad necklace for its price. However, I think it should mention in the description that this is a close-fitting necklace. It would probably be more accurate to call it a choker. If you're like me, you prefer a necklace that isn't quite so clingy."
0,"This product was a waste of my money; a stone came out because of the bad craftmanship. I missplaced the packing for this item otherwise I would have ran it back to UPS for a quick return. Don't waste your money ""Buyer Beware"""
0,"I didn't even get what I ordered, and when I did get the product it was late by weeks."
0,The ring looked just like the photo on Amazon; however I was very upset when I wore it because my finger turned black where the ring touched my skin. This ring was not sterling silver.
1,"This is my favorite piece of jewelry, hands down, and I NEVER take it off. When I do, I feel naked. :p"
1,"When my daughter helped pick these out for her sister, I had to promise that I'd buy a pair for her on her own birthday. They are every bit as pretty and festive as pictured, and different from what you can usually find. 'Candy' jade is a good description - all the swirls and lovely anticipation of old time penny candy. Plus this is a good company to buy from - everything arrives with its own box, in great condition, with very quick delivery."
1,"These earrings are exactly as they appear on screen. They are elegant but also casual enough to wear with anything. I bought two pairs for gifts. They are a nice length, beautiful color, and very feminine."
0,OK earings for the price but the ones I received were an odd shade of green. Be careful if you are expecting a pink pair of earings. Photo implies they are pink but there was only a small amount of pink in the set I recieved and the combination of those colors made the earrings look a little cheap.
1,These earring are really pretty! I also have the matching bracelet and the earrings are a nice complement to the bracelet. They are swirled with green and pink as pictured. They are priced very well too!
1,These earrings are very lovely and well-made. I love the lobster-claw type of closure so they don't fall out but move without hurting.
1,"I thought about these for over a month before finally ordering them. From the description and the picture, I thought they would be HUGE. They are not. They are the perfect size and the picture does not do justice to the beuatiful hot pink color (my favorite)."
1,I choose this product as a gift for my sister and she found awesomeShe loved it at first sight100% satisfiedthank you guys
1,"I purchased this ring as a wedding band. I did a lot of shopping both online and in stores, and found that this series of rings from Amazon.com was the best value. The ring is beautiful! The detail of the milgrain is impeccable, and to get a platinum ring at this price is pretty amazing."
1,"Absolutely beautiful, light weight, really sparkle, love the lever back closure, very comfortable. I plan to buy other colors; I recommend you give them a try."
1,"I bought these to wear on my wedding day. My necklace was real pearls and these were not, but no one could tell! They really were stunning. Worth every penny!"
1,I get compliments everytime I wear these earrings.I got the white pair and the pink pair.They are real attention-getters!I'm going to get the blue too!They're absolutely stunning!
1,"These pearl drop and crystal earrings were a Christmas gift for our daughter. While the pictures on Amazon are impressive, once we actually had the earrings physically in our hands, we realized that the pictures did not do them justice. Our daughter (who is 14) absolutely loves them!! She never wants to take them off. She does understand they are to be worn for special occasions, but she loves just wearing them around the house. They make her feel beautiful! For any 14-year-old that can make all the difference."
0,"the earrings looked exactly like they look on line. However in my rush to go away for Christmas I did not open the package before leaving home. When I opened, I saw that only one earring had the hook on it. I could not wear it at all. I had already destroyed the package in which it was mailed and I do not know my options. SO one earring looks great but no hook on the second earring."
1,"Arrived timely, lovely earrings and I especially like the clasp.....very secure. Also purchased a pair for our daughter. May buy a couple pair more for Christmas gifts."
0,This is a crappy item. You could have gotten this item elsewhere with no more than 5 dollars. Don't ever buy it if you can avoid it!!
1,These earrings are actually very nice and a perfect size. They will make a great gift. I would purchase from this seller again.
1,The earrings came exactly as described. I have received several compliments from my friends. All of them were impressed by its low price. Good choice!
1,These earrings are a must have! They are small but well made...very pretty and the lever backs make it easy to slip them on and off...look great with any outfit! love them! 5 stars!
1,These earrings are great. They look nice and make for a wonderful gift. Out of the packed they worked correctly and shine in the light.
1,"These earrings are great. Easy to put in, long enough to be noticeable but not too long to become annoying to the wearer. Excellent item for those who love FMA. I just don't understand why it asks me to rate a toy!"
1,"My girlfriend has always asked for a tri-color gold bracelet which has proven incredibly difficult to find in retail stores. This bracelet is more delicate than the picture may suggest, but it definitely made her eyes light up."
1,"I bought a women's long sleeve shirt,with the space for my turquoise links"
0,I bought two of these necklaces for my bridesmaids. The chain on this necklace is a very poor quality. It is very flimsy and looks like it will easily break. The pendant was also much smaller than I expected it to be. I was able to find a better quality necklace locally for a lower price and ended up returning them.
1,This polishing cloth does a very nice job of cleaning silver jewelry. I didn't realize how dull my silver ring and bracelet had gotten until I used this cloth. The cloth is thick and should last a long time. I only wish more than one came in the package.
1,"After having a baby and losing around 45 pounds, my navel piercing doesn't look like it used to. Every ring I've gotten doesn't fit right like its too loose, or if it was a top dangle would get caught on stuff and irritate it. I was considering just taking it out and letting it close up. Not this one! The dangle doesn't feel heavy so it doesn't pull down, but it is good quality and not flimsy. The bar fit my piercing perfectly so it doesn't look like its just hanging there. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone who is having problems with the bar being too long and wants something different from just a plain standard barbell! Fast shipping and very well packaged. Couldn't have been better."
1,"I bought this as a small sentimental Christmas gift for a close friend of mine. It arrived quickly, as I have Amazon Prime, but when I opened the gift (I'd read that the chains come tangled sometimes, so I wanted to make sure it was untangled when my friend opened it) I was horrified at the condition of the chain. It was almost completely brown and tarnished. It was late, and the holidays, and Augustina's site explained to call Amazon over any orders fulfilled by them.I called twice trying to get something done, and the service was terrible! They were completely unsympathetic to the fact that I now had a damaged and embarrassing gift to give to my friend. The pearl was beautiful. They told me I could get a refund if I mailed it back, but refused to try to send me another chain, which was all that I wanted.Amazon told me that I had to call the company directly if I wanted any actual service. I went ahead and emailed the company, since I was soon getting on a plane and wouldn't be home to play phone tag. They did respond to me quickly, and had a new chain sent via Fedex overnight to my hotel in NY. It took two nights because of the recent blizzard, for which the company apologized profusely. (The city-crippling blizzard was not their fault, but I sincerely appreciated the fact that the company took ownership of the issue and bent over backwards to make it right.)Not only did they send me a new chain (which was beautiful) but they also included a nice gift in order to apologize for the inconvenience. The products are lovely, I think this was just a storage issue. I would definitely buy from Augustina again."
1,"My point- the picture obviously shows a brushed finish, as compared to the piece that connects it to the chain, and the description states ""20 inch chain"", I am uncertain why the negative reviews reflect the product, rather than the buyer's reluctance to investigate the item before purchase. I have one, and it is exactly as described. I'm very happy with the purchase. It is light, not ""flashy"" and offers a nice alternative to ""bling"". Buy one with confidence."
0,I thought it was big.the close up of the image makes it big.its ok though. nice design. its just not that thick.
0,"From the picture and another review, I expected this to be a nice bracelet. First it is not 8 1/2"". If you stretched it to its breaking point, it might be 8 1/4"" from the tip of the chain to the end of the clasp. The chain itself is less than 8"".It might fit nicely on a child's wrist, but on a grown male, it will probably cut off your circulation. The links might be 6mm long, but I doubt they are much more than 2mm wide. When you open the box, you'll be surprised how small this is, especially if you paid $85 for it (or even $60 in a Gold Box deal).I've always been wary of jewelry from Amazon, but this was an absolute disappointment. I'm surprised that anyone could call this tiny chain 'masculine' looking."
1,"Opened the package and WOW! This ring is gorgeous, very, very, eyecatching. About 1"" long and 3/4"" wide, an absolute ""must have"" for MOP lovers."
0,The design is nice; however the stone color is a bit of a dissppointment. It is a dull yellowish green and not very sparkly.
1,"I just bought this for my Mother for Mother's day, and she just loves it. She would give it a 10 if she could."
1,"I viewed these products, but did not submit an order. Imagine my surprise when I received a package about 6 months later??? I kept the purses for gifts."
0,"A beautiful ring, I got it in August and by November it's become slightly tarnished. :("
1,All my friends are curious and jealous of my sparkly new christmas party ring!! I smile and say THANK YOU!!!I couldn't love it more if it was real diamonds And my friends think it is =)
1,"Love this ring, water it all, the time. I have gotten great comments on it, and suits my larger hands"
1,This was a great ring for it's price and served me well through the end of my pregnancy. I did not want to be without my wedding band through my pregnancy and my finger had become rather large. I was having trouble finding a large enough fake in the store so I got this ring and loved it. Hope to use it for all my pregnancies if my finger turns GIANT again.
1,Item arrived in a timely fashion and I was surprised to see it was more brillantly stylish than advertized! I am very pleased with my order and would reccomend to anyone to order this item!
1,wow i searched so many sites its crazy and finally i decide to go to my amazon.com account and i find the absolute perfect ring for my girlfriend i couldnt be more happy and i know she will be too as soon as i give it to her!!!! this is my second purchase and everything with the last purchase went very smoothly and i am sure that this one will be no different.Thank you amazon.com!! omg i love this ring!!
1,"For the price, I couldn't ask for a better ring. I've had it for about a year now and it still sparkles. Fits perfectly and doesn't turn my finger green like some cheap rings. I love it!"
0,Very beautiful ring but just too big for my taste and hand. Would've kept it otherwise.
1,"What more can I say, this is my named I love this charm. Its perfect and it looks great on my bracelet. I have had no problems with it at all, very well made."
1,"I *just* received these earrings 10 minutes ago and I couldn't wait to come here to tell everyone about them! For what you spend on these, you get a huge bang for the buck. This is why I'm a returning Netaya customer. They are every bit as pretty as the picture and I can't wait to wear them (I got them for myself as a 'stocking stuffer' so I'll have to wait awhile). If you think these are something you'd like I wouldn't hesitate."
1,"Since I wear my new FSM lapel pin, I've had several nice opportunities to explain what it is, and what it means wearing it. Of course, in several occasions I've been asked further and I've been able to explain my points of view concerning religion. As an European citizen, I'm (almost) always welcome when I introduce myself as an atheist."
0,"Poor quality, not a claddagh, there is no crown. You can see the seams, the hands on the band are terrible."
1,I bought these for two pre teen girls on my Christmas list. They are so pretty and delicate looking. The girls loved how they sparkle in the light. Would recommend.
0,"I like the price, and the chain looks lovely, but my hair gets caught and tangled in it, so until I find some solution for that, I can't really wear it very often. I have had it for months now and it has not turned green or black, and the gold did not fall off, and it did not get kinked up. It still looks as beautiful as the day I got it. It just yanks my hair out when I wear it :("
0,"Necklace broke just after a day, not repairable. Wore with a locket on the end, when I bent over the necklace broke near the clasp but not the clasp itself."
1,These cufflinks are beautiful and very well made - we are very pleased!
1,I've never ordered chains this way. Took a chance and was very happy with results - items were much better in reality than on the website (where it was hard to tell what size mm's are). Love the ball chain - doesn't catch on fabrics and holds the lockets beautifully.
0,"I bought this (as a bracelet) for my sister last fall for Christmas. It looked nice when I got it, but after sitting in the drawer for a month or so, I took it out to wrap it and it appeared that the silver had chipped off significantly. :( So I threw it in the trash and had to buy something else for my sister."
0,"Purchased two for my daughters. First necklace broke after fwo weeks when my daughter put it between her teeth and bit ( of course that makes sense I thought) but the second one broke only days later when I was pulling my smaller daughters shirt of her head, and I was only gently tugging. Very sweet look, but too fragile, especially for kids. However, it is nearly impossible to find a more secure type beaded neck.ace in a 14"" length."
1,This item was shipped and received very quickly. The necklace is exactly as I pictured and was very good quality. Overall a great experience.
0,"We were happy with the quality on the first ring we received, However it was the wrong size. So we sent it back and got a smaller size that was too big. Then we sent it back and got a half size bigger and that was too big. By that time we gave up and used masking tape on the ring. The other down size was the enamel on the ring we kept wasn't even filled in all the way. So overall I wasn't that happy. I gave 3 stars because my husband was happy to have it. Also the price was good, but not after sending the ring back so many times."
1,"This ring is really well-crafted, just adorable, perfect size, not too big and nicely polished. Great gift for a dolphin lover or anyone who likes sterling silver jewelry."
1,We are so happy with this ring! Great value and looks amazing. I can't wait to put it on his finger on wedding day!!
1,"My husband lost his wedding band because he was losing weight so I bought this since I knew he'd be losing even more weight and we'd probably be replacing this ring also. He loved it and it was great up until he lost more weight, it got loose, and he forgot to leave it at home when we went to the beach."
1,"I just ordered this ring on Sunday night and it arrived Wednesday... Very fast shipping. The ring itself is gorgeous... even better than in the picture. I had my finger measured and the lady told me to order a 9 1/2. After reading some reviews I saw that these comfort-fit rings run a little big so I ordered a 9 and it fits perfect. The ring comes in a very nice little black box with a black ribbon and bow (doesn't look girly at all). Very nice product, fast shipping and nice packaging... what else could you ask for?Before I bought this ring I looked at some other styles. The local jewelry store had a tunsten/carbon-fiber ring on display that was very nice and cost $300.00. I got home and looked online. I found similar rings for about $100.00 but I read that the carbon-fiber an scratch easily. I found this solid tungsten ring instead for a lot cheaper. In the end, I like the look better and it was a lot cheaper. Definitely recommend this ring to others."
1,"I was very satisfied with this little pin. It's nicely made, doesn't look cheap and is a size that's just right. It's like real jewelry, a nice alternative to a cross."
0,"Buyer beware! I just threw away $46.00. This is a piece of junk, I will never,ever order another thing from amazon,ever,very,very,disapointed!!!"
0,"I purchased this bracelet for my husband, and he loved it. Unfortunately, it wasn't very sturdy and was easily dented and bent. He did wear it all the time, however. It looked great on him, and he is hoping to receive another."
1,I was very impressed with this bracelet. Excellent quality. I purchased it as a gift for my 23 year old niece and she loved it! I plan on purchasing another one for myself.
1,I love this bracelet!! More than I would have hoped for - it is very very eye-catching. Would definately recommend it!!
1,I love silver and got this bracelet to replace a bangle bracelet I have worn a lot. The link bracelet does not crush into my wrist when I am performing normal daily tasks. The flat wheat link is brilliantly shiny and substantial looking. I am buying a necklace like it next.
0,"Bought for my wife. When I received it, the top cover had visible scratches. I assume that was due to inadequate packaging. Also, after less than a week of use, the bottom drawer fell apart."
1,"My husband bought this for me as a Xmas gift last year. It was absolutely beautiful and I will Cherish it always. I love Queen Ann style and dark mahogany and cherry woods. It is very big and has plenty of room for all mu jewelry. This piece is an accent/decoration all in itself. Some pieces my husband had to put together, but it was very simple. It arrived in perfect condition. Not a scratch on it."
1,"I am in love with this jewelry armoire!!! Use it EVERY DAY!! It has tons of drawer space, it stands pretty tall at 4 feet. It came with NO dents, no broken pieces it was perfect! It was also very easy to assembly!! I highly recommend this armoire!!!"
1,"You can find other key rings similar to this one, but they are considerably more expensive and are not any better in quality. This is a great deal for the price."
1,"I first saw this when it was paired with a LaCiE flash memory device shaped like a key. While relatively uninterested in that product, this one struck me as a pleasant alternative to jamming my fingernails into key rings. It doesn't seem flimsy, though I do have slight concerns about the ball that screws in on the end.Nothing special, just the same sorts of concerns that a person with a tongue piercing would have about the opposite end of their bar being swallowed, dropped down a drain, etc. It serves its purpose and cheers me with its visually pleasing form.EDIT"
1,"I've used a keyk ring like this for 40 years and have lost and replaced two. This replacement was equal to the ones I've used before and is a very attractive, nice key ring. If I lose it (let's hope not) I would replace it again."
1,These earrings are great. Not too big and not too small. I wear them with almost everything.
0,"Wore the earrings twice and the device that you secure them in broke, not very good quality."
0,The bulldog detail was nice but was alittle big for my taste. The part were the chain goes through is huge!!! did not look right with a silver chain unles you like some thing really large but I did find a black cord rope chain which i thought looked great.
1,"I bought this item for my cousin, she liked it a lot! Had to buy her another one! She uses it quite often"
1,When I opened these rings I was amazed at just how beautiful and striking they are. I especially like the Native American symbolism. The man that received the other ring was as impressed as I was. The price is phenominal.
1,beautiful made- perfect-- wish it came in other sizes- difficult to find a jewler to size it--thick band needs lazer--
1,"The glass pendant on this necklace is gorgeous. But, I found the pendant to be too big for my neck. (The length of the pendant was about 2-1/2-inches long and 1/4-inch wide.) The leather chain is of good quality and seems durable. If you like bigger pendants, this is a perfect necklace!"
0,Cute and inexpensive bellyring. Beware if you leave it in while showering it tarnishes & turns black within a week. I guess you get what you pay for..
1,I love these earrings! Light weight so doesn't drag on your ears. The lever back closure is great. Good quality and reasonably priced. Great product!
1,"SINCE I BOUGHT IT FOR MY 4 YRS OLD PRINCESS, THIS BEAR IT'S JUST CUTE AND ADORABLE...IT LOOKS GREAT ON HER, BUT FOR ADULTS IT'S WAYYYYYYY TO SMALL!!BUY IT FOR KIDS AND YOU WON'T REGRET."
0,DO NOT BUY THIS RING!!! IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE PICTURE BUT THE ACTUAL RING IS A CHEAP SMALLER VERSION OF THE PIX! TERRIBLE PIECE OF JEWELRY !
1,"I'm so glad I bought this ring! The shipping was extremely fast- there wasn't much waiting for this one. It's dainty (but not flimsy- this is a nice solid piece) and feminine- and is very true to size. I love how it lays flat on my finger and doesn't catch on anything, and it also doesn't seem to be getting scratched up like some silver does. I have received many compliments on this ring and I'm very pleased with it!"
0,"The ring has a good appearance, but it's at least a full size smaller than standard ring sizes."
1,A very nice piece of jewelry. Quality workmanshipand not big and gaudy like some others. I like it very much.Thank you
1,"The ring is beautiful. I received it within days of ordering it. Overall, the value for the price was excellent. I'd order from this vendor again and I'd recommend them for any friend looking for silver jewelry."
1,"I love my ring. It was just as advertised. The peace sign is small and intricate and just what I expected. Thanks for the speedy shipping, too! (:"
1,"i really thought that it was going to be a cheap ring but it wasn't, it looks great :), elegant but not too elegant, it's an everyday ring, love it! i also though that it was going to be bigger but it wasn't so it's just perfect :), simple, like i wanted, it looks exactly as in the photo, and it came really quckly too. :) very happy with my new ring :D"
1,"I bought this about two years back, and have worn it every day since! It is still the same beautiful quality as it was the day I got it. I still get regular compliments on it. I haven't ever regretted such an awesome purchase."
0,"The strand was beautiful, although not all the pearls matched well in the terms of luminosity, and a few had ripples, but pearls are not perfect. I was thrilled when I took it out of the box. It comes in a wonderful padded booklet type storage folder, quite elegant. I wore it to work today and 5 hours into my day, I went to re-adjust the strand, as I had it doubled on my neck, and with one little lift and very light tug at the strand it pulled apart and sent a pearl flying across the floor. Its going back and as much as I'd love to order a replacement, I would never feel confident it wouldn't happen again. I have a 40 dollar strand I bought on Amazon a couple of months ago, with less perfect pearls, and I use it as a lanyard for my flashdrive. Never had any problems with that one. Much as I wanted to love this strand, I can't trust it now. This is something I would want to be aware of, if I were thinking of buying."
1,I like dangle earrings but not too long and these fit the bill for me. So pretty! Lots of compliments and the price was right!
1,They were given as a gift to a friend for her birthday and she loved them.
1,"This ring was even lovelier on my friend's finger than shown in the pictures. It was well packaged and arrived very quickly, which was nice, since it was a last-minute gift. The sizing is also very accurate. So far she's been careful not to bang it on anything. I have a suspicion she's going to put all the other colors on her Amazon Wish List too!kat in sNJ"
1,My daughter is very happy with this item and wears it often. She is 15.
0,"I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I thought the ring looked beautiful online but when it arrived it's in person appearance was much lower quality than the picture indicated - it just looks a bit cheap and tinny. If I'd seen the ring in person, $35-40 is probably the most I'd pay for it. For almost $70, I expected a high quality product even if it was sterling silver and CZs.Still, I wore the ring out and got quite a few compliments on it so would have been inclined to give a more positive rating if one of the smaller fake sapphires didn't fall out THE FIRST DAY I wore the ring. I definitely wouldn't recommend this vendor to anyone nor will I buy from them again - which is really too bad - they have a lot of cute jewelry designs."
1,I bought this for my fiance and he liked it so much I ended up buying one for myself too.
0,The pendant was not solid and had a hollow sound to it when you tap it on your teeth it sounds like tin. In the picture shows that the pendant is two-sided but when we got it only one side has a St. Michael's on. I don't mind that but only rattles sounds tinny on my gold chain.
1,"This cross is very well constructed and just the right size if you want something in between the large, chunking mens crosses and the petite, hideaway, crosses."
1,love this didn't fit on the necklace I originally purchased it for but it is beautiful
1,i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS JEWELRY BOX! I had a different one previously which i thought was large and spacious until all of my jewelry got tangled together and ended up being one big mess! this box is gorgeous and has room for everything!! all different size compartments and perfect spaces for each kind of jewelry. it is a little large and looks clunky on my dresser. but if everything is neat and its the only think on the dresser it looks fine. otherwise i love this item and thank my mom for getting it for me for chanuka! :-)
1,"Purchased as Xmas gift for my 18 year old granddaughter. She loved it and with purple being her favorite color, made it twice as nice. This is a great jewelry box for a teen or woman of any age. Good quality and very well made."
1,"With all the weather making deliveries difficult, Shining Image responded immediately and bent over backwards to help us get our order to our Grandchildren. I would do business with these folks anytime."
1,"I bought this jewelry box for my granddaugher for Christmas. I know she is only 5 and this is a bit much but this is the jewelry box I would have wanted when I was her age, long, long ago, so I bought it and I am really glad I did. Of course it was the best Christmas gift ever and my daughter was actually speechless of the beauty and the grandeur of the box. Needless to say my granddaughter loved her jewelry box and will do so many years to come. Maybe my daughter can borrow one or two compartments for her things?"
1,"Yes, this is just what I wanted. It meets all of the necessary requirements that I need for this item. Thank you."
1,A great find as not only a jewelry box but a suitcase and perfect for teens andcollege age girls.
1,"Both my teenage niece's had alot of jewelery and no where to keep it. I researched alot of jewelery boxes but most of them did not hold alot of jewelery, and they were very expensive. I bought them both this jewelery box and they both love it."
1,"I was skeptical about the quality of the jewelry box because the price was so reasonable... I was very happy to discover it was everything they said and more. Excellent delivery time, excellent packaging, excellent quality, excellent pricing. The purple color is just as pictured. Thanks for a great price and product."
0,i got it today and is ok the back part is falling off but nothing superglue cant fix the box itself is pretty
0,"Ordered this for my daughter as a consolidated jewelry box. However, it is MUCH smaller than I'd anticipated based off the pictures. It might be a reasonable small travel case for multiple peices of jewelry for a long trip, but not if your intent is to keep any signficant collection in one place.It was however, delivered faster than expected."
1,"I am so happy with the purchase of this item that I couldn't wait to get the reaction of my nieces ages 5, 8 and 9 (who will all receive one of these for x-mas) before submitting a review. The number of compartments alone should thrill them! The quality of the leather and construction of the case was definitely more than I expected. The tan case is much less yellow than the picture and more of your typical camel color. I also purchased the pink and it's slightly less intense than the picture but also very pretty. Probably would not consider purchasing for myself because it's not the type of case I would want displayed in my bedroom. However, I think for girls ages 5 - 15? it's perfect. Thinking along the lines of being fun for the younger ones and practical for the older ones. Certainly not an heirloom piece to be passed but I think it's a great gift - certainly something I would have loved when I was younger."
1,"This is the best jewelry box I have ever seen. I bought it for my mother in the nursing home. The drawers are just perfect for her butterfly jewelry and she uses the top part for her make up. She can sit the case on her tray table and look into mirror in the lid and apply her make-up. Then she can put her jewelry on. After that she can shut up the case and put the case away, neatly and easily. I recommend this case to anyone."
0,"There is no way this pendant will lay properly due to the poor design. I'm not thrilled with the color of the stone, either, but could overlook that if the pendant would lay flat as it appears in the illustration."
0,The charm is very cheap and lightweight as it is hollow. The charm feels more like a cheap piece of plastic. There are highly visible seams along the sides of the charm where the two halves were joined together. The loop where the hook is attached to the charm also seems flimsy. The chain that came with the charm did seem to be decent quality but I did not buy it for the chain. My wife was very disappointed and I returned the item.
1,The wife and I have been in need of one of these for years. We'd always just make a trip to the mall to pretend to look at some jewelry and have the sales person run our personal rings etc... through the 'professional' cleaning device they all have. I must say this Sonic Wave cleans the jewelry as good if not better than the mall store's device. We love it! It brought back the sparkle to a very old dingy necklace in no time!!
1,I purchased a bunch of these style bracelets. They are the perfect size for my small wrists and very good quality. You don't have to worry about getting imitation or plastic instead of the real gemstones.
0,"I bought this for my gf. It's nice for the price, but the clasp NEVER holds. It comes off ALL the time."
1,Words can't describe how beautiful this necklace is and for the price it was a steal!
1,"I bought both the necklace and the earrings of this set to match the ring given to me as a gift. It is an excellent cut and 14kt. white gold, matches identical in addition to the diamonds added in the mix. The color of the aquamarine is gorgeous and have gotten many compliments on it."
1,I purchased 4 of these necklaces for gifts for my bridal party and I was very pleased when I received them.
1,very nice necklace and pendant. Pearl is a good size for a single pendant and the chain is beautiful with Italian quality. I got both 18 and 16 inches chain. I make one as gift to my best friend. It is a good keep shake gift.
1,This necklace is very pretty. I am so excited to give it to my bridesmaids! I like it so much that I ordered one for myself as well.
1,Great necklace for the price. I gave it to my wife at the birth of our son. She loves it and wears it all the time.
1,I purchased these pendants as gifts for my wedding party and they are just perfect! I wanted something affordable but something that was good enough quality to be a keepsake. You can look around if you want but this was the best quality for an affordable price that I could find anywhere and will go perfect with my bridesmaid's dresses!
1,I bought these for my 6 bridesmaids and although they haven't received them I know they will love them. I had been looking for reasonably priced pearl necklaces/pendants for a while. For $27 they are wonderful! They are better than I expected. I also really appreciate the very unique and pretty boxes they came in. Perfect gift!
1,I was looking for a wall mirror and came across this jewelry armoire. I'm glad I purchase this. It's blends nicely with my contemporary style and holds more than enough of my jewelry with the slots and hooks inside. It even comes with two sets of keys for locking purposes. I definitely recommend this! No longer do I have to dig through my jewelry box and untangle my necklaces. This holds them very nicely and I can easily browse through my selection of jewelry.
1,This necklace is simply beautiful and the picture does not do it justice. It is much prettier in person. I highly recommend people to buy this item if they are thinking about it.
1,"I found this bracelet at Amazon, and I purchased it for my best girlfriend's birthday. She really, really liked it. So while I haven't seen it in person, I have to say it must be really fantastic -- she notes how well she likes it all the time, and it wasn't the only bracelet I gave her that birthday:)"
1,This is such an elegant beautiful necklace. It shines like it has diamonds in it. I was very pleased when I got it.
1,I bought this necklace because of the great reviews and it's a looker! It proved a success for my fianc&eacute;e's birthday. A+ Recommend
1,My girlfriend thought it was great. Good cheap gift to make someone feel special.
1,I love this ring. It is light and made beautifuly. I would buy it again. It did not take long for me to get it and they had it in my size. The stone is just the right size for me.
1,The ring came in a timely matter and was absolutely beautiful but the stone fell out 2 or 3 weeks after i got it. the setting isnt really secure.
1,I had been looking for these studs for quite sometime. They are perfect for 2nd and 3rd holes.
1,"i can only wear sterling or gold, and i needed a new set of stud earrings that i can wear when i sleep, work, play, shower, etc. these are the absolute most perfect studs. perfect price. high quality. when you need to retain a piercing comfortably, these are great. they feel weightless, and the backings are also sterling silver. i'm thinking of buying three more sets just to have them! i haven't seen this quality of stud earring since BOMA. my ears are happy, my pocketbook is happy, if only everything in life was as simple as finding a good pair of studs."
0,obviously there was a typo here. look at their other products - all between 250$ and 400$.
0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. The leverback hooks for the earrings are different, very noticeably DIFFERENT. One is so much larger than the other, as to be very noticeable when worn. When I put them on, one earring hangs lower than the other. Even looking at them, the other hook is wider. It would be so much money to send them back that it isn't worth it, since they were 8.50 on sale. I will likely just throw them into the trash. I don't know how much a jeweler would charge me to get a leverbacks matching in size. The pearls actually match fine..., though.Not sure I will ever purchase from this seller again, unless it is an item that does not come as a pair.--an update"
1,"These are nice everyday casual earrings that look nice against dark, long hair or with your hair pulled back and just dangling. Can't complain, for eight bucks I have certainly gotten my money's worth. I have worn them a lot this summer."
1,"They're beautiful. I've had people ask me what karat they are. They're delicate looking, but strong enough for how thin the silver is. They reflect light beautifully. They're a great size, they're really light so I can barely feel them when I am wearing them. I love them."
1,I am so glad I purchased these earrings for my friends. I am jealous and wish I had ordered myself a pair!!
1,"I bought these earrings after I had picked out all of my other stuff and thought ""what the heck they are under ten dollars."" Well all I have to say now is ""Wow!!!!"" I love these earrings. I used to have a pair that was similar and I lost them. These are not the same, but they are wonderful. Try them out and you'll see."
1,My gf found these online and i bought them. They look better in life than on picture. Worth the price.
1,"I love these earrings. I thought that they might be real small but they aren't. They also aren't long just a nice length. They are 1/34"" from the top of the dangle, not the part that goes through your ear. I love them. I have a second hole above the one I used for these and I put a CZ post in that one. Looks really pretty with the two together."
1,"Very nice looking earrings, and you don't even feel it when wearing, got lots of compliments from friends! It's perfect for dates and parties!"
1,"I love these earrings because they look fun, but they're not heavy like most dangling earrings. I hate having something tug on my earlobes. I almost forget that I'm wearing these because they're so lightweight without looking cheap."
1,I bought 3 pair of earrings from this company and love everyone of them. Comfortable and eye catching to wear.
1,"I bought this set of earrings with a certain friend in mind. She loved them! They are beautiful, light, and definitely worth giving as a present or even keeping for your self."
1,Item was shipped and received within the time limit given. Good quality product t t t t t t t
0,"First off. When I initially got this item I was incredibly happy. Estatic even. I've been looking for something like this for a long time. The only problems I had at first were minor. The chain was too small for me to wear comfortably, and for added protection, I doubled the hoop thing that the necklace goes through. Other than that, I was happy.But after wearing it a couple days, I've noticed the back of the pendant has started to wrap/bubble. And it kind of creeps me out. I don't know why. I guess it seems kind of cheap. The main reason I wanted to buy it was to wear, but I don't want to wear it if it'll disintergrate on me, or have the bubbling become worse.Still. I would liked to have rated this higher. When I got it, I was so happy. It was beautiful. Much better than the picture. But, I guess it's still nice."
1,It was simply very elegant and my best friend loved it as a birthday gift. Would purchase one for myself maybe for Christmas next year....
1,"This is a very beautiful Toe-ring, nicely crafted, I love it! If one has pretty big toes it might not fit quite es nicely but it does with me, just right!"
1,I bough this for the baptism of my niece and it was perfect. The size is exactly what they said and it was very well finished
0,"I got it as a mother's day present. My mother loves it, but she'd love anything I gave her, even if it turned her finger green. My mom never takes it off, except when taking showers or washing the dishes. It seemed to wear a bit but it still looks nice. You can tell that it's not the best quality though."
1,I absolutely adore this charm! I wear it almost all of the time & get lots of compliments on it. It's very attractive & just big enough to be worn as a pendant OR simply as a charm.
1,"Very cool design. I wear it very often and it looks great. Chain and pouch comes with it as with all Forbidden jewlery pieces does. I like it because itso diffrent then your standard christian cross.Love the piece and it is actually abit sturdy to, not so fragile as you might think.Great buy"
0,"I bought these earings for my daughter couple of months ago. It seemed okay they were 10K yellow gold fo a 4year old, but after 1 month of wearing them they turned copper like color. I don't think there is any type of gold left there. I think they were covered with a thin layer of gold. They look bad now and I would like to be able to return them.I never got any kind of certificate of quality with these earings and I understand why.they looked nice in the picture and maybe fort the first month."
0,"I ordered this ring when my real engagement ring was being sized so I wouldn't have to deal with questions from nosy coworkers. As another reviewer pointed out, the stone is not emerald cut ... which didn't really matter because it fell out of the setting about 3 days after I got it."
0,"Item cracked and broke after only about 3 days of wearing it, it was cheaply made and a waste of money."
0,I love mother-of-pearl stones and this ring held up pretty well until one day the stone came off. I had to crazy glue it back in place. I'm glad no one can tell. Other than that it's a pretty good looking sterling silver ring.
1,This is a very pretty necklace that has a good length and stay connection!! The seller is nice and you can trust the seller!!
1,"This was a gift for a car salesman, and he loved it. Just as I thought he would. It stands out when he wears them."
1,This ring is amazing i had doubts but i love it!!!! The setting is great the stone is not loose at all! The size is right on the money!!!!! It looks amazing on my finger and with my wedding band i also ordered off of amazon!!!!! I could not be happier with my purchase and the price is amazing! And it got here early!!!! No complaints at all :)
1,The ring is very beautiful and exquisite. I would highly recommend it. This was exactly what we were hoping for!
1,Wow! this ring is wonderful its so simple! Its perfect! it is an amazing quality just by the way that it sparkles! I love it!
1,"My now-fiance and I were looking for ""cheap"" wedding rings since we're young(18/19) and are saving up money for a house rather than expensive gold and diamonds. After looking at many different rings, I fell in love with this and the .925 Sterling Silver CZ Eternity Band..especially the price! I was a little afraid that it would look noticeably fake, but the reviews were pretty good. I don't think that it looks fake at all. The size is really great, I definitely wanted a smaller stone. I had actually wanted a round-cut originally but the one offered by this company is too big (I ordered that one too..still got all three rings for under $40!). My parents and fiance are the only ones who know how much my ring cost, would tell the in-laws but they can't keep secrets. My fiance doesn't want everyone to think he's cheap because if I asked, he would buy me a $3000 ring. I'm so glad I found this ring because everyone thinks it was more expensive and nobody has honestly questioned if the stone is real or not. I've actually got comments about how it shines. So my fiance and are both very pleased with the ring. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a real-looking solitare ring for cheap or young couples (or couples that just don't want to spend the money for gold/diamonds)..it's a steal!Gem Avenue was very quick with delivery also..ordered on a Monday night and received the rings on Friday afternoon (with standard shipping).By the way"
1,"This is such a beautiful and delicate ring on the hand. It CZ is brilliant and has good ""fire"" but I doubt if anyone who ever saw a real quality diamond before would mistaken this ring for real unless they're more than an arms length away. It's a decent size stone and not gaudy or fake looking and for $7, an unbelievable price even though the thickness of the band is uneven; only noticeable to the wearer. It came in a beautiful silver heart shape box with a pink bow, perfect for gift. The 2 other items I bought from this vendor, I would give simialr reviews."
1,"My husband bought me this ring as a surprise. I didn't have an engagement ring, I just wear my wedding band. After a date night he presented this ring to me, and it is simply stunning. It came in this little adorable gift box. I wear it all the time now. And as a mother of two young ones I have to say that this ring keeps it shine and sparkle wonderfully. Even in bath and dish water. I would and have highly recommended this ring to all of my friends and have received so many compliments as to how beautiful it is. I plan to order more through this seller, hopefully soon!"
1,"Its a fake ring. there i said it.However, nobody needs to know that. I gave it to my GF to make her smile. She knew it wasn't real(because she knew i couldnt afford it). But she wears it sometimes anyway. for fun. She is also a server in a restaurant and she wears it to ward of the flirting and says it works well.great $10 purchase."
1,We were looking for an engagement ring and came across this one. I have small hands so I didn't want something to big. When is arrived the CZ looks amazing. It looks like a real diamond. It could pass for a real one that you would be spending anywhere from 400-1000$ on. Overall I think this ring looks stunning.
1,I absolutely love this ring. It's really pretty and doesn't rally look all that fake. I would definitely recommend this to couples who don't want to spends hundreds if dollars on a similar ring.
1,"i realy love my new ring, it is small, beautiful, gentle very nice and i love it when i see it on my finger :D &lt;3"
1,this ring is beautiful its even prettier than i expected! i have been wearing the sterling silver princess cut ring for a month and it still has a brilliant sparkle the shipping was ver fast 2 days verry happy customer!
1,She gets compliments on it all the time! You should see the way her face lights up when people ask her about it! I get my money's-worth every time she gets asked about it!
1,I am happy with this order. That is why I rate it with 5 stars. It arrived on time and it is good quality.
1,"I picked this out after I got engaged, and my fiance bought it for me. I love it so much. It's got a lot of sparkle, and the band is very comfortable on my finger. It's very light."
1,"This ring is so pretty. My boyfriend got it for me for christmas and it looks way better than expected! I thought the price was great (I feel bad when he spends money on me so being under $15 was perfect!) and all the reviews were so good! I thought it looked nice in the picture, a cute little single stone ring, and boy, when I opened the box I was surprised! I knew all the reviews said good things but the picture did not do it justice! its so shiny! I've never owned a ring more beautiful! I get so many compliaments already! He gave it to me a few days early so I wore it to work sunday and monday, we're not planning on getting married for a few more years cause we're young, but I wear it on my left hand (I wear my class ring on my right) so many customers told me how pretty and shiny my ring was, and a few even congragulated me for being married! It looks real! We work at the same grocery store and our manager asked if we're engaged and so did the lady at my bank! Its so pretty and looks like it would cost more than $13! I love it!"
1,The size 5 was too small for me so I gave it to my daughter and ordered another for myself. My little 6yr old feels very proud to be sporting a real diamond and that she and mommy have matching jewlery. Well worth the price.
1,I just got it today.. and its very beautiful and lovely. I really love this one.Its look real. Im gonna wear it now. And this vendor was good too.. I brought to this vendor a couple times already.. They putting it to a safe package too.. I love the heart box that they using... thumbs up! good job..godbless.. this is my engagement ring got to pairs of wedding bands too for our wedding...:)))
1,I am so pleased with this ring. The stone seems to be the 'right' size and looks so real. I wear mine with a solid band and it looks like a perfect wedding set.I will buy again from this company.
1,"I absolutely love this ring! It's a great size, very beautiful and always sparkles! Very nice size, fits just right!"
1,"When I first received this item, the box was beaten up pretty badly. I instantly thought to myself, ""Dang, I just wasted some money."". When I opened the box, I was pleasantly surprised! I bought this ring as a stand-in for an engagement ring, since my fianc&eacute; and I are saving up for an house. He's saving for a ring currently, but it's wonderful until then, and looks incredibly real. The only complaint I have of this ring, is that the edges are indeed sharp. It often snags of fabric, but in my eyes, that's the one flaw of this ring. Wonderful as a gift, stand-in engagement ring, or promise ring.I LOVE IT! &lt;3"
1,"this is the cutest little ring ever! i wasnt expecting much when i bought it, just figured it wasnt much money and if i didnt like it i could send it back. it came in a cute little box with a bow, and i was amazed at how cute it was...so cute...my mom stole it from me :("
1,What an adorable little ring very shiny and just the right scale. I haven't told anyone I paid under ten bucks for it -- you should see how much they guess I bought it for! haha! Great Value!
0,"This ring is very cheaply made, the band looks as if it will snap. It's off center and the stones not even square. Totally disatisfied."
1,"Excellent as the one in image very good and serious store , I reccomend their products"
0,"this ring was not what i expected at all from looking at the photos and reading the previous reviews. the stone is not like the othe cubic zirconias that i have seen. it has this very defined ""X"" shape in the stone from the way they cut it. the metal is very very cheap. it gets scratched very easy. i guess its a good temp. ring till you can afford a real ring but dont expect anything more than a vending machine quility ring. thats exactly what my bf said when he saw it."
1,"My little boy ordered this for me as a surprise for christmas. arrived in a beautiful green box. to quote him, ""he was pleasantly surprised"" diamond and ring are shinier than some of my Tiffany pieces. Looks exactly as pictured. very pretty."
1,absolutly gorgeous i wear mine everyday everyone thinks its a real diamond but since its sterling silver its bends very easily. mine fell off my finger and hit the ground and bent but it was fixable
1,The ring looks and fits really good. I'm very pleased to have found it. It works well with my wedding band.
1,This product seems to be good quality so far. As advertised. Did see anything wrong with product. It is also priced reasonably low.
0,"I bought these earrings for my mother for Christmas. I was very dissappointed. The pearls are a milky white, not pinkish as they appear in the picture. They dangle a tad crooked. The pearls themselves are average at best. I do not recommend these earrings."
0,"Although the gold colour was rich and appealing, the size of the charm was way too small for my purposes. So, I returned it for a refund."
1,My 7yr old daughter loved this birthstone ring. It is just what we wanted and looked very beautiful on her small hand.
0,"They don't lie about the size, but seeing is believing. This charm is SMALL. Don't think it compares to Flavor Flav's clock! I bought it for my sister and I'mma really have to impress how valuable it is because the size may lead viewers to think something different. Having said that, if you know Black women who love them some Nefertiti, then this would be a great gift for them. If you or they feel that ""less is more,"" then you will be pleased. I actually may keep buying copies and giving it as presents to dah sistahs."
1,"I'm so happy with this choice. I was afraid the cz was going to be too small, instead they are of great porportion and fiery without looking to flashy or blingy. I find them to be a beatiful feminine touch for everyday. They are light and comfortable and fall just perfectly below my earlobe."
0,"After the rave reviews I expected a pair of gorgeous earrings. But, the leverbacks were quite large, too large for me. But, the worst thing was the CZ's were just dead. I own several CZ's and all of them sparkle greatly. NOT these. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a pair that shine. Mine didn't! I'm sending them back."
1,My daughter loved these. They look wonderful on her. The lever clasp is great and less likely to lose the earrings.
1,I have gotten lots of compliments on these earrings. I was asked several times where I got them. LOVE THEM!
1,These are just great and I love them. I love leverback earrings now and wear nothing but them!
1,"THESE ARE SO BEAUTIFULL, THAT WHEN MY SISTERS AND DAUGTHER SEN THEM, I HAD TO BUY THEM EACH A PAIR, AND THATS ONE OF THIER CHRISTMAS GIFTS,"
1,"It was just what I expected it to be. It was simple and yet beautiful. It arrived within two weeks before Christmas, just like they said it would."
0,earrings were a little too small for me but I kept them. The measurements throws me off.
1,"Very nice diamond cut hoops, sparkle in the light. Lightweight so they don't damage the ear lobe."
0,I tried to leave a review before but amazon wont let me. These posts are so thick you cant possibly get them into your ears.
1,It is really cute and was very easy to install..My 'little monkey' even knows it is her and looks for it on my bracelet! Product came on time and was packaged very well.
1,"these are as they picture them and its nice and light and is solid silver they look good, the price make them a good buy"
1,I love these earrings! They are well made and lovely to look at. They look exactly like the picture. The price can't be beat either! I plan on buying more from this seller.
1,"This being the noughties.. being able to do most things online - and with spare time at a premium (not wanting, especially, to go around shopping in over-priced stores), I found Amazon's jewelery section great..(Now, you should go to a shop to get sized...)Amazon's ""design-it-yourself"" feature is absolutely great!I know that saying that you bought your diamond online is not exactly glamorous - not like going to Tiffany's or Harrod's...But the ring I got from Amazon is lovelier (and less expensive) than many of the rings I see in display around here...The only problem was that we had to ship it to a sister living in Ohio, and she had to bring it over for Christmas in 07.. (No international shipping; we live in Ireland)However, I believe Amazon UK is now selling jewelry, as well..Highly recommended!"
1,These earrings are a great addition to your collection. They provide a nice alternative to pure gold hoops--which cost quite a bit more. I have had them now for several months and they show no signs of color change!
1,"This ring is beautiful, understated, and elegant. Although, it may not be mistaken for the real thing upon close inspection,it is not so flashy that it screams fake. If you're looking for a replacement for the real thing, you just can't go wrong with this one(and the price is great too)."
1,"It replace my wedding set, i use it every day. Its beautifuL & perfect."
1,This set is beautiful. I totally love it. Looks very really so worth the money. Want to spend the money on wedding right now and not the rings. No one can tell it isn't real. Great purchase.
1,"Just got my ring today! Only took 3 days!! It comes in an adorable pink heart shaped box w/a ribbon tie on top. It is just as beautiful in person as it is on here! Looks exactly like the picture and fits perfectly! I am a size 5 and it fits perfectly! Both rings look so pretty paired together on the same finger also!My friends don't know its not real, and i am getting plenty of very positive feedback! They love it!! I was gonna get a real ring when taxes come, but this is so beautiful, its not necessary!! You will NOT regret buying this ring!!"
1,"The picture shown on here doesn't do this ring any justice.! It is even more beautiful in person.! I was a little weary about purchasing a ring online for many reasons, one being unable to try it on. I had to order a 1/2 size up because they don't carry 1/2 sizes and that worked out great.! It fits perfectly, with a little room so when my fingers swell (which they do, often)it wont be uncomfortable. Overall, excellent set of rings for a price you cant beat and i would recommend them to anyone.!"
1,"My husband got me this set because my last set ($890 set) was lost/stolen, and i asked him not to ever buy me one that expensive again because i don't trust myself to not lose another one. I've had this set for a little over a month and i love it. I never take it off, no one notices that it's not real! It hasn't tarnished or turned my finger green or anything. I am truly amazed at this set. I had a hard time trusting a ring set that was purchased online where you can't see it in person, but i honestly love this set!"
0,"When I first got this ring I loved it. I couldn't believe that it was so pretty for the price I payed. It didn't look fake at all, it was so shinny and it looked more like white gold than silver, also it was a perfect fit in a size 5. However after a while of wearing it the shine begin to fade. Now it is beginning to look more like costume jewelry. But I cant really complain because it was so cheap. Overall it is pretty but I just wish the shine had lasted."
0,I love the look if the ring but the first day I wore it to work and I'm a hotel manager so I have a desk job I picked up a stack of books and my ring bent and no one can fix it
0,"I purchased this ring to replace my lost wedding ring (put it in a safe place and don't remember where that safe place is).Shipping was okay, not slow but not fast either.When I first opened the ring box I was instantly disappointed. The ""diamonds"" look fake. ""Diamonds"" have that blue tinge to do that screams fake.When I picked the rings up, they felt fake as well. That lightweight feel you get when you hold a 50 cent ring from the store machines.I have had it about 2 weeks and both rings have already begun to tarnish.Overall, I would definitely not repurchase and I caution anyone who is looking for a wedding ring replacement or a ring to wear daily not to purchase this ring set."
0,"I bought this about half month ago. But it start to get dark now. Is it sliver??? Not worth the price, not fit for everyday wear."
0,"it looked real/beautiful on internet but when i got it, i wasnt satisfied 100% at all. This item will be my first and last order."
1,"I love this set. It is so realistic, I have purchased other sets and this is absolutely the best one. I use this one for everday wear and receive so many compliments on my ""diamond"" set. It is great. Than you Gem Avenue for producing such great jewelry."
1,I love this ring I got the smallerRing before and loved it I just go this today and I'm happy fit is great it's sparkly and shiny and a perfect size I love it
1,"First I want to clear the air with misconceptions. Plain Sterling Silver Finished Rings will last longer than any other Finish ontop of any ring.. Rhodium Plated is know as the cheapest and easiest finish to sell. Because of this most Rhodium rings are lower in price. Do not be fooled. rhodium tarnishes from everyday wear, unlike sterling, No matter if its a walk in the park, Rhodium will tarnish and sometimes cleaning it with the cleaner will make it worst off. I learned this the hard way. Even though these rings look stylish and really really intriguing dont loose site, even if you have to pay 10 or 20 more dolllars for a plain sterling finish. Please do, because Rhodium is not meant to last very long. My ring faded after I slept in it.. It tarnished and i couldnt clean it, not even tooth paste worked... So sad.. but true..."
1,"I just got it through Fedex, It is beautiful. I was a little scared especially after reading some reviews, and w/o a lie I was preparing myself to return it. But once I got it it is gorgeous! It is definitely a keeper. I just dont understand why sterling silver isn't considered a ''real'' ring if its just as good...I"
1,I think I have been wearing this ring for about 7 months or so now and it is gorgeous I love it and I am wearing it as my temporary engagement ring! I think it is worth every penny!
1,"I really like this set of rings. The engagement ring looks like it has a real diamond, sparkles nicely and is a nice size (not microscopically small, not ostentatiously large). The sterling silver rhodium plated band is very nice, it hasn't tarnished, and it shines brightly. I'm allergic to nickel, which is one reason why I bought these rings. They are true to their ""nickel free"" advertising since I haven't had any reactions to them. The only reaction I get to them is everyone that sees them thinks they are beautiful. I like that the diamond has very little height, it makes it look more like it is inset and my clothes don't get snagged by it. I ordered size six and they fit perfectly. The rings sit together nicely without any noticeable gaps. All in all, these are an excellent set of rings, especially for the price!"
0,"I usually love the things I order from Gem Avenue. I got rid of my real wedding set a few years ago (long story) and since then have been wearing cz sets. I ordered another set from Gem Avenue and it is amazing. I get compliments on it constantly. I thought it might be fun to have something new so I ordered this set. It's ok I guess but a little disappointing. It doesn't really look ""fake"" but it looks like a diamond set that would have been cheap because of poor quality. The rings do not sit flush together and contrary to other reviews, both my husband and myself could see the gap. The metal looked cheap and the setting seems a little off. I am going to be returning this set. I would say it's a good set to buy if you're just looking for something to wear while on vacation, but I'd recommend looking at the other sets Gem Avenue has. This one is certainly not their best."
1,"This ring is very beautiful. I have been wearing it daily at work, shower, cleaning etc and it still is in perfect condition and looks perfect. Great quality for the price. I was very pleasantly surprised. I have even had many compliments on it. This ring was definitly a great purchase."
1,Seriously...you cant even tell its not real...The stones are just the right size far from goddy and fake looking. I bought this set because i do manual labor for work and i didnt want to ruin my real set. I get so many complements!!...I got the set very fast to!...I cant wait to order more from this seller!!!..
0,"When I first got this it was very pretty, however in the 9months I've had it it's gotten very tarnished. I would not recommend this ring to anyone."
0,The diamond does not have any height to it. This ring looks very cheap. I was not empressed with this product at all. I sent it back for a refund.
0,"The set was actually really nice looking. BUT, the center stone is tottally crooked! It really throws off the look of the ring and the center diamond has no height to it at all. I really dont know how to feel about this set because its a really beautiful set. But it also has a really big flaw. 50% good and 50% bad. But otherwise nice and believable. Im returning my set that i just recieved today. Not happy about the center stone at all."
1,"Purchased as travel rings so that I can leave my good ones at home and not worry about them. Love these rings. Have been wearing them daily to see how they do. So far so good. No discoloration. Still shiny. These may become my daily rings instead of just my travel rings! Thinking about buying another set, just in case. Thanks!"
1,"Ive had it since late october and it is perfect, has bein complimented like crazy. really shiny and comfortable together and seperatley :) i would recommend it. also came with a little cute blue box with a bow! better then being sent in a plastic cover!!"
1,"Excelente articulo, llego en el tiempo estimado y articulo llego con las especificaciones estipuladas en la descripcion del vendedor. Muy bueno el articulo"
1,"When I got this charm, I was surprised at just how delicate and detailed it was. That's not to mean it isn't sturdy - it seems quite strong, it is just very beautifully done."
1,Much more original design than it appears in the photo. I love mine and it makes me feel younger. Tks.
1,Bought this as a gift. very pleased with the packaging and the presentation. The chain is a very nice addition to the silver colection. Would recommend buying this one.
1,"I bought this ring for my wife and I'm sure she will love it. It is not a certified diamond but the ring is bright, shiny and it sparkles. Good value for the price. I checked around on other sites that offered the same, or almost the same ring, and this is the best value for your money."
1,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT WAS A GREAT PRICE AND MY FAMILY COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFRENCE. IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT TO SHOW YOUR STYLE WHEN HAVING A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.
1,i have to say of all the jewelry purchased over the years sabrina silver has the highest quality for the price!!!!!
1,My fiance is going to love these. Very unique and very pretty. She wanted jasper earrings for Christmas and I ordered two different ones. These are by far the nicest
1,"bought this for my son for christmas - I like them, I hope he does too!! They are simple yet classy and still very stylish for a ""young"" man."
0,"You will require microscope to look at the stones.The chain is so thin, not sure how manys hours or days it is going to last.not worth buying,"
1,"As other reviews have said, and I will also:1) great looking quality - I mean, really, what do I know, I'm no jeweler, but they are very clear, no color at all (i.e. yellow/brown), and sparkle brilliantly with lovely colors in the light.2) The mounting is really nice. Almost disappears so you just see the gem(white gold)3) The size is really OK -- my wife has very small ears, so they look ""normal"" not small -- but honestly, even before she put them on, when they first arrived I was a bit surprised they looked - not big - but not small.Very good deal at $305 - Amazon came through here!"
1,"Before buying these earrings on Amazon, I did price comparisons of the same diamond stud earrings from different sellers, both local and online, and Amazon beat them all with very affordable price (it was a Gold Box Deal of the Day for $297). Immediately fall in love with them when received. They sparkle perfectly. Right size for my ears. Love them!!"
1,"This is the second pair of diamond studs I buy online, and I am supremely satisfied. The quality is exactly as described (although I wish there was a certificate attached about the specifications).The only improvement I would recommend is a more premium type of packaging, rather than the small velvet pouch."
1,I really loved the jewlery but was a little nervous because no reviews. I ordered my necklace and braclete on 11/18 and recieved today 11/22 It was actually a lot earlier then expected!!! But very great customer service! I will be buying more from them diff
1,"Oh my god. I have middle-of-back length fine hair. This is the prettiest hairstick ever! Looks SO good with a bun, or an updo hairstyle. Also looks great with a long thick fall! Which is what I got it for! I feel like a princess no matter how I wear it! Not too wide, not too dainty. And its real silver, at comparable prices to cheap-looking base-metal & crystal ovrpriced hairsticks! This, I will have forever! Very sturdy! Not too heavy though! Get one its amazing. ~ Namaste"
1,"I ordered this ring because my wedding ring was too small for my pregnant fingers, and I wanted something to wear until they shrink back down to size. It really looks great, and is certainly worth the $15. The diamond isn't too big and it does not strike me as particularly outlandish."
1,"I shopped around for earings quite a bit and must admit I was initially a bit hesitant to buy fine diamonds from Amazon. That changed when they arrived. The diamonds are spectacular and better quality than the minimum listed. The packaging is elegant, including a nice wooden box and nicely packaged certificate to accompany the diamonds. Another winning product from Amazon."
1,"My wife has always wanted high quality diamond studs that had a certificate so I looked around the mall at all of the jewelry stores. After checking every store, I purchased a pair that were 1/3 ct were F in Color but only I1 in clarity (the saleswoman convinced me that the clarity was not that important), they were $500 dollars on sale. When I gave them to my wife she was very happy. My wife is always looking for the best price, so upon seeing the name of the jewelry store on the box and reading the diamond report, she asked me the price. She suggested I return them as they sounded too expensive for the clarity and were at the low range of a 1/3 carat weight. My wife said try Amazon since she had only heard great things about their prices and their quality.Received these today, WOW!! I was very lucky since the IGI Certificate states that they are better than listed and the Estimated Retail value is astonishing. They are absolutely beautiful and my wife is ecstatic.I will always buy my diamond jewelry from Amazon."
1,"I ordered these for my wife and they turned out great. She was very happy with them.We ended up getting 0.52 CT each, with G & H color, and VS1/VS2 clatirity.Great earrings but the price fluctuates alot on amazon for this item."
1,I bought these earrings when they were an extra 75% off ($550) and I can say these are amazing. The pair I received were VVS2/VS1 and G/H color and had a appraised value of almost $6000.Thanks Amazon.
1,I don't know too many people who continue to be Nominations charm collectors but my daughter still loves them. The candy corn link is brilliant in color and is a great addition to her fall and halloween collection. Precious Accents is a terrific merchant. I had my order in about two days which excellent in my book. Plus they have a huge selection so I was able to order several for the same shipping charge.
1,I am thrilled with these earrings. Mine were G-H color and VS1-2 as described. They are so amazingly sparkly. You can't miss them a mile away. They are big but not so large as to look fake. Can't be more pleased!
1,"Bought it as a gift for my best friend. I think these music boxes are really a great gift idea, I loved this one"
0,"watch out! this necklace is bigger than it looks. It is about 1.5"" tall (pendant only)."
1,I bought this gift for my sister-in-law and it was beautiful. It is high quality and looks great.
0,"I ordered this necklace and it was pretty but it was huge! Not at all to my taste, and the chain is an odd cable, very industrial looking."
1,Got this on the Gold Bx Deal of the Day and my girlfriend loved it! Circles were even larger than I expected.
1,I came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. The person that received it loved it.
0,"This ring is on a par with what you might get from a bubble gum machine. The silver is of very poor quality, and you can actually bend it with your fingers.Very flimsy, and it is definitly going to be returned."
1,"I have been wearing this ring for about a year now, and I really love it. I have received many compliments about its unusual nature. I beg to differ with the person who said that this was of poor quality. Yes, you can bend it... if you are really pressing, but it's not of a flimsy nature. Enjoy."
0,"I thought this ring looked interesting in the photo, but in person it is flimsy, flexible and relatively cheap looking."
0,I received the product and it looks good. But the chain is very thin.The most disappointing thing is that I did not recieve the IGI certificate mentioned in the Product Specification for this item.My decision to buy this was mainly due to the IGI certifate.Moreover I could not find any customer service contact information in the entire Amazon site to inform them about it.
1,Purchased two of these for my nieces and they loved them! A little big for little hands but none-the-less they wear them all the time and show them off to friends and family.
1,"Not only was this received promptly but it was nicer than the picture, which is rare!"
1,"I love the design of this necklace, intricate yet low-key, very classy. A great investment!Any chain necklace, especially one this thin (something that can be made only with platinum), can get tangled up sometimes; hence, the packaging needs to be improved."
1,I really liked the ring and bought another one from them and will buy another one soon.
1,"This ring is even better than photographed - it's absolutely lovely. I was looking for something that was thin and simple, and this absolutely fits the bill. The detail is wonderful and it's lightweight, but sturdy. I wear it on my pointer finger. It works well, despite the fact that it's advertised as a pinky ring. It works well on both. I highly recommend this ring. It's just wonderful."
1,I wear this ring all the time! I have had it for 3 years and it has not bent or scratched and I wear it all the time! It is a really sturdy nice ring!
1,"This narrow band ring is very comfortable by itself, but I wear it with one or two other band rings in a stack. It is narrow enough not to be overwhelming, but wide enough to be seen and admired. I would recommend it to anyone who likes or collects Celtic Knot jewelry or stacking rings."
1,"This ring is very pretty and I love it, but it is quite thin so I have to be careful not to bend it when lifting items."
1,This ring is great. I bought it for my pinky. It isn't to bulky or big.
1,"Delicate and feminine. Sure to become a ring I wear every day. One other review said ""flimsy"" but they are so wrong! I tried to bend it but it wouldn't budge! Shipping was fast and secure. I will buy from this seller again. - I am VERY happy."
0,This ring is MUCH thinner that it appears on screen. I do like it and am keeping it but I doubt it holds up well.
1,Quite pleased with this ring! I adore Celtic stuff! Thankfully it does not leave a green ring on my finger like some other cheaper silver jewelry I bought. Thanks a lot! :o)
1,I ordered this as an everyday ring. I've been wearing it for a week straight and have had no issues with the ring at all. This would make a great promise or friendship gift. Everyone who asks seems to think it has a special story behind it!
1,"My daughter and I both ordered these. The sizes were perfect, and they arrived as expected. We wear them as Very pretty pinkie rings!"
1,"This ring I wear on my left thumb, in honor of my wonderful husband's forever love!! Fits perfectly, I only know it's there when I look!"
1,Nice little pinky ring that blends into the backgroud which is exactly what I was looking for. The fit is great. It can be worn with any other rings and still look great. Not exactly cheap and the shipping jumps the price up there but I have enjoyed the quality of jewelry from the seller so it is worth it in the long run.
1,"I'm a bit obsessed with Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series right now, so I bought this ring to wear on my right hand, as Claire does with Jaime's ring. I love it! Great quality!"
1,I ordered the wrong size and should've ordered a larger one. The ring is absolutely what I wanted but it was just a wee too snug! I ordered it because I really liked it but nothing was wrong with it. The detail on the ring was awesome the picture doesn't do it any justice!
1,"I absolutely LOVE this bracelet! Its design is cute, it's sturdy, and I've gotten so many comments and ""Where did you get that from?"" while wearing it."
1,This is an adorable music box. I gave 2 of them as gifts and the recipients loved them. I bought one for myself also. Darling. Darling. Darling.
1,Gold Label takes the same basic layout and uses it for a number of different boxes. Like this mini wood box and the matchbox boxes. We have a number of different ones and like most of them. This one is cute and has a lot of detail on the figures. The center scene rotates as the music plays. There is a little illuminated (battery powered) shelter that adds to the miniature nature of it all.Very cute. Makes a nice small gift.
0,the ring seems to be of good quality and not too heavy to wear. the ring size (9) is smaller than other rings I have in size 9. also thought the 'top side' of the ring looked bigger in the picture than it is.
1,"i have the orange one, its pretty. i get so many compliments when i wear it."
0,"I had no trouble opening this pillbox, but once I did I had two surprises. First, it was not polished on the inside. And worse, it had a price sticker on it marked $7.90. Deeper and better made is the Frank Lloyd Wirght pillbox for the same price I found on Amazon. Although not sterling silver it is much nicer and appropriately priced."
1,This labradorite tank bracelet is very attractive. Mine is a mossy green (colors vary) with flashes of other colors.
1,"I received this ring a week ago, three days after ordering. The stone is a bright nice shade of green, like in the picture. I ordered a size 6, and it fits the finger intended perfectly. I believe I've fallen in love!"
1,"Bought this ring for $29.99 through Amazon. I replaced a real gold thin (3 or 4 mm) wedding band. I was skeptical about this ring being the price was cheap. Price was low but so far the quality has been wonderful. I have been wearing this ring since November 19, 2007. It is 02/18/09 today. I priced Tungsten at local jewelry stores for $200 and up! I had thoughts of buying a backup or two since I like this ring so much for the price especially."
0,"Yeah well, it looked exactly like the picture. With a little imperfection. I don't really like the ring in person though."
1,"This is a great ring! I love the color, sizing was perfect, I couldn't imagine anything better!"
1,I also like this ring. The fit (size 8) was perfect. I love the color and the design. I would buy again.
1,The days I do not wear the blue one I wear this one. I really enjoy wearing something Celtic and pretty.
1,Silver Insanity has some nice products at good prices. I've bought several items for my wife and she is pleased with all of them.
1,"Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Celtic Knot Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9)Bought this little ring for my wife as a ""just because"" present. Let's just say I got something in return ;) These rings are beautifully crafted and look good with just about anything...(or nothing at all)"
0,i liked the ring however i was very disappointed that the garnet stone was more orange than the dark red of the true garnet i was hopeing for. this was a very special ring for my daughter whose boyfriend was named Redd and his favorite color was red and his birth stone was garnet. i ordered this ring for her in remembrence ofRedd as he was murdered only days before. so this was a very special ring to us. we were hoping for a more blood red color of a true garnet.
1,I was really impressed with this ring -- an excellent value!
1,"I love this ring beyond words. I love the color of the stone and the intricacy of the silver. It overall is a bit smaller than I thought, but I don't really care. It is a beautiful ring and I love it. I wear it with pride and I am very pleased with this purchase and I look forward to showing it off."
1,"This ring was on my wife's Wish List. I ordered it and stuck it in her Christmas stocking. It was well received.The ring arrived in a small velvet bag with a pull cord, which was a nice touch. Arrived before the scheduled delivery date."
1,BOUGHT THIS RING FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I KNOW SHE'S GOING TO LOVE IT. THE QUALITY OF THIS RING GOES WAY BEYOND THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG ORDERING FROM AMAZON.COM!!!!!!
0,I bought the bracelet expecting the stones to look like amethyst. Unfortunately they lack color and almost appear like a very pale rose quartz. It is well constructed and comfortable. Thats about all I can say about it. I was not pleased with this purchase.
0,"I found this sterling silver amethyst bracelet at a great low price, so I bought several for gift giving. The bracelet comes in a small gift box and includes a storage pouch. The amethysts are a pale purple, providing subtle contrast between the stones and the sterling silver.When I first saw the bracelet I thought the stones were way too pale. They certainly aren't as deep as the image suggests. However I sent a couple out to family members as birthday gifts. Many in my family have skin issues and react negatively to plated jewelry. The both recipients loved their new bracelet.If I had bought this for myself I would be unhappy, I would expect deeper color in the stones. As an inexpensive gift the receiver has no preconceived expectations, both family members were excited and raved about their gift. For my purpose, this sterling silver amethyst bracelet was perfect.PROS:Nice giftSterling silverCONS:Pale stones"
1,I just received this lovely cameo and am so pleased. It will be the perfect gift for my daughter-in-law as we are expecting our first grandson any day now. The pendant arrived in a very cute ceramic cupcake shaped jewelry presentation box (surprise) and is of the highest quality. Will definitely plan on purchasing again from this seller. Thank you.
1,"So if you feel like a princess this is the necklace to let everyone know it. LOLThis necklace is so beautiful, especially for the price and I would pay twice as much. It is the perfect size and weight, not cheap at all. it almost looks like the stones are real because it is truly well designed.You will be very happy with it if you get one, or it would be the perfect gift. When I received it I made a big deal of showing it off and everyone was very impressed, and the packaging alone with make you feel special.I now know that the Amazon collection is awesome!"
1,"I ordered these during the busy Valentine season and was afraid they would be out-of-stock, but they were not. Also, considering the season, the delivery time was reasonable. I was very pleased with the quality and have received many compliments on these earrings."
1,"Having worn this bracelet off and on for almost a year, I can highly recommend! These bracelets are great. About 7-71/2 inches. Strung not too loose or too tight, on good quality elastic. Doesn't stretch out or break (Not yet any way!) Don't think you could be disappointed!"
1,"i waited a week before making the review so not to be influenced with the excitement of receiving something new. i'm very happy with this gold bracelet for many reasons - the design is quite unique (as opposed to a cuban, figaro, mariner or byzantine bracelet). the links are solid on every attachment which means it will last a very long time. i really like the way the bars contrast with the oval links and the bars are etched with greek symbols.before i received the item, i contacted the seller and alex was very helpful. email updates were sent to me quickly. i'll say the customer service by the seller is excellent. the only thing i would have wanted that it didn't come with is the 14k stamp. i can overlook that since i bought the bracelet for me and the purpose of jewelry, in my opinion, is to provide a general sense of good vibes. my life is beautiful - the seller's mantra is so appropriate because if you can afford fairly expensive jewelry, then you have a good life compared to a lot of people who are struggling and can not afford to spend on unnecessary items."
1,These earrings actually look better in person than in the picture. They are just the right size and the detail is great.
1,I got the ring as a gift for a LoTR fan. They loved it!!! Enough said.
0,"It was difficult to find shirt studs without cuff links, so when I came across these sterling silver studs, I purchased them. They are very nice - a good weight and quite dressy - but too small for the button holes on my husband's tuxedo shirt. The studs popped right out the first time he used them."
1,I love this item alot .. it's really beautiful .. & great sizethank you
1,I was very happy with this pin.It was even better than what I expected and looks gorgeous. You will not be disappointed.
1,Given the price these are a great buy. A pair of diamond studs in 14k white gold is very good. Worth the investment.
1,"Not much to say. They're the diamods that were pictured, my girlfriend iswearing them as of this writing.I'm hardly a diamond expert (except baseball diamonds where I used to make my living writing sports)but these looked pricey and not over-stated.I would buy them again but she has only two ears."
0,"The price was the only thing that was good about these earrings.The earrings arrived very quickly and nicely packaged, but the quality of the diamonds were very poor. They looked dark and gray and not much sparkle. The white gold looked like pewter, not even silver gray. The picture on the website made them look clearer and shinier, which these were not!I will return them immediately."
0,"I did not know anything about Clarity, Cut, or Color until now. This prudusct is exactly as advertised. If you do not konw what the different ratings are then do not buy it."
0,"While I *hoped* to receive a better pair of diamonds, I did receive what was promised ... K color, I3 clarity. When I place this pair next to my F color VS1's, this pair looks gray and dull. The cut is poor -- uneven and not symmetric.This pair is a gift for my 16-yo niece for Xmas. I'm sure she'll love them ... and won't know the difference between these diamonds and better quality ones."
1,I bought these earring were very pretty and a good size. I purchased them as a birthday gift for my sister and she likes them very much!
1,You can't go wrong with this ring! My husband works in a warehouse and needed a ring to supplement his wedding band. For the money this ring is awesome. Very durable and attractive. We did have to return and buy a size smaller- runs kind of big. I absolutely would purchase it again.
0,"I returned this item immedately upon receipt. Although I realize that the pendant was not as large as the photo shows, I was shocked to see (more accurately, I was unable to see) the size of the stone. A peridot is a SEMI-PRECIOUS stone, so, for $45.00 the stone should be larger than the tip of a ballpoint pen. This pendant should be priced at around $20.00. Amazon needs to include an 'actual size' photo on this type of item or they can expect a large number of returns."
1,"The pendant is very small. I can't remember if the description gave the dimensions, but it's no larger than an eraser tip on a pencil. However, it is gorgeous and a very high quality item."
1,This is long after the necklace was ordered and received. High quality excellent product still looks brand new.
1,My brother bought these for me for my birthday and I love them. Warning though
1,I love these earrings. They are VERY comfortable and will look great dressed up or down. These are well made and I highly recommend them (especially at the sale price of $29.00!)
1,Gave this to my wife for Christmas and she adores it. Nice stones and sturdy clasp
1,"The picture provided by amazon is actually quite accurate. This bracelet is sturdy, well constructed yet light-weight. Each blue topaz is even colored and sparkles well under the light, along with the tiny diamonds. The overall design is simple and elegant. My girlfriend commented how exquisite it looks. This is a beautiful bracelet and I am very happy with the purchase."
1,I absolutely love my braclet. I will enjoy wearing it. My daughter helped me to buy it.
0,"My husband gave me this bracelet as a birthday/christmas gift (My birthday is Christmas Eve). I put it on immediately and later that day it broke. The bracelet broke a few links away from the clasp. After reading other reviews of their bracelet breaking, we decided to return it. Its beautiful, but if you wear it, it might break. I'm really disappointed because husband never really chooses jewelry for me and when he finally does, it breaks."
1,"My husband gave me this for our 25th wedding aniversary, and to go with some other pieces I have, and I love it. The blue color is almost hypnotic, and the tiny dimonds make for just the right amount of sparkle. I'm getting lots of compliments everywhere I wear it."
1,This ring is beautifully crafted. Big and Bold but a very wearable size. The color of the red coral is clear and true.
0,This ring was not what I expected. The stone is very shiny. The little stones around the perimeter look fake. All the stones look plastic-ish. Was super excited to get this ring but I'm returning it.
0,"These earrings are nice but I am really disappointed about its actual size. It's tiny! But regardless, it's a beautiful gift!"
1,Beautiful. Good workmanship. ice stones. Diameter a bit smaller than I thought but otherwise will be a nice Christmas present for my bride.I.
1,"These earrings are beautiful!! Not too big or not to small. Only bad thing about them is needs to be made with screw backs for security purposes, so they don't come out until you want them off.. Great Price"
1,"I bought these 14k Yellow Gold Sapphire and Diamond J-Hoop Earrings as a birthday gift for a family member.She adores the creative earring design - slightly offset J-shaped curves of eight dark blue sapphires and eleven bright round diamonds on each J-Hoop earring.The earrings are about 1/2"" wide and 2/3"" long.Although small enough for everyday wear, these earrings are exquisitely made and won't go unnoticed. She's happy with all the attention that these sapphire and diamond earrings receive!SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESThe diamonds in these earrings are clear and bright. According to the 'Jewelry Information' the color is IJ, clarity is 11-12. So, whatever imperfections that exist in these diamonds are not discernible without x10 magnification. I don't think that would ever be a problem! :))DIAMOND SPECS"
1,THESE EARRING ARE THE RIGTH LENGTH FOR EVERY ONE AND YOU COULD WEAR THESE EARRINGS ALL DAY OR FOR EVENING WEAR!YOU WOULD LOVE THESE EARRINGS!
1,"Ever try finding the right gift for your girl? Well, these little beauties went over in a big way! Very nicely made and looked dazzling on. Highly reccommend."
0,"I was very disappointed in the purple color of the earrings when they finally arrived. The amethyst isn't the rich purple portrayed by Amazon. It's pretty washed-out looking. If I hadn't waited 2 months for them and if they weren't only $60, I would return them. However, under those circumstances, it would be more trouble than it's worth. I've bought other gemstones online and they were very true to the onscreen color. This is my first big disappointment."
1,"I admit I was a little weary about purchasing these earrings, b/c a shopper can never be quite sure what he/she might get (esp. where jewelry is concerned & certainly, on-line purchases), but I'm glad I gave in on this one. I bought these as a Christmas gift for my mother, and she just adores them. There's a lot of sparkle for these delicate earrings, and she just loves the color! She has already received numerous compliments after wearing them for 1 day! Simply put, they are lovely, elegant, & v. feminine-a perfect choice with which I have no regrets!"
1,"OMG, when I saw the photograph of these earrings, I said, ""I just gotta have those!"" The rich, dark brown color looked so gorgeous on the product page, I practically drooled, imagining them adorning my ears. ... And did I have the perfect outfits to match!When I received them, I wasn't disappointed. They ARE gorgeous--sparkly, clear, and ever so stylish. I like the way the radiant, smoky topaz gems catch the light as they dangle so gently. Swaying back and forth in a rhythm of their own, they catch the light, sending forth brilliant flashes of gold. And with not one, but three different cuts--princess, round, and pear shapes--set in 14k gold, they're absolutely stunning.Another thing I like about them is that they complement the brown garments in my wardrobe as well as the blacks and neutrals.The price didn't quite fit my budget, but they're worth every penny I spent ... even if it means a few less books this month. Oh, well ...Reviewed by"
0,The earrings color was not green. It was an indefinable color; really light not green or clear. The earrings size was acceptable.I returned the earrings because I couldn't match with anything.
1,These earrings are exactly what I expected. They're actually nicer than the picture...which I expected because of all of the positive reviews. :) They are just under an inch from top to bottom (just as an image shows) so the circle and teardrop hang below my earlobe. The Rose-de-France is a nice light purple to match a pink amethyst pendant necklace that I bought from a department store. I'm planning to wear the earrings and necklace for my wedding (I don't have tons of bling in my jewelry because the dress has a lot going on). I'm excited that I'll be able to dress these up or down in the future.
0,"The earring are not the same color as shown, barely green tinged. Otherwise nice style and cut. Wish they were more green"
1,"The earrings were exactly as pictured and matched perfectly with a pendant that I have.They are beautiful. Thanks Amazon, I could have searched for months and never made such a perfect match.14k Yellow Gold Rose De France Pear and Square Dangle Earring"
1,"As others have stated, the green is very light -- don't expect a pronounced green color. But they are absolutely gorgeous and I'm delighted."
0,"The photo is deceptive. The diamonds are microscopic, and the gold chain as thin as a strand of hair. The moon is depicted as hanging by one end with the angel ""sitting"" upright, but the chain is attached to both ends of the moon, making it look like a ""U"". I gave it as a gift to my daughter, but we will have to get a better chain before this one breaks."
1,"I was looking for a different kind of stone for my wife for our anniversary, and decided to try these. The color is a very light green, and my wife loved them. I will be buying matching items as Amazon offers them."
1,"If you love the look of pearls and emeralds but don't want to spend a fortune, go for this ring. It's beautiful and does have a ""blooming"" quality to it."
1,I WOULD FOR SURE BUY THE RING AGAIN. IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND A GREAT BUY.
1,"It is a very cute earrings, it is small good for teens and adult who like to wear small jewelry. I love them."
0,"I guess you get what you pay for, but the cross was extremely small and light-weight. I bought both the pink and purple crosses for my twins. They were so small, I couldn't tell which color was which."
1,Excellent just what I expected! Received item within 4 days after order placed. Feminine but evil. I loved it and she did to.
0,"The ruby heart devil pendant arrived this afternoon, in time for Valentine's Day, but I'll have to buy a new gold chain before I give it to my wife.The pendant itself is beautiful, and just as pictured, but the chain that came with it is of a thickness that is only about 1/4, or less, the size needed for a pendant of this size and weight.The chain is barely a ""chain"" and is far too small and fragile to use for any other application or purpose."
1,"Cute necklace. The ruby was larger than I expected. Pendant is well made, and the ruby has a nice color to it. Would be perfect to wear for Halloween."
1,"I bought this for my 16 year old. Perfect for a lovely devilish girl! Horns and tail are so tiny that only she (and loved ones) see the humor in this beautiful delicate necklace!Quick delivery, pretty jewel case."
1,"purchased this for my college-aged daughter- she loves it! very pretty, nice quality for the price!"
0,"Nice size pendant, the horns and tail are very subtle, which I liked, but the stone looked almost plastic-like. Perfect for a teen, or young teen, but my wife likes it and wears it often."
1,My husband and I have this little joke we have shared since we were dating in 1997
1,My boyfriend knew I have had my eye on this for a long time. Last night he surprised me with it. I LOVE it! The pendant is beautiful!The chain is a little small so I just replaced it with a heavier one.
0,"The chain is extremely thin, very dainty, and the pendent does not hang well, it wants to tip, top heavy.but it looks nice."
1,"The picture does this &#34;no justice.&#34; It is just beautiful. It looks soooo expensive. And so delicate. I just love it. I bought it for myself, just because I liked it. But I love it. Beautifully packaged. I am going to order two more for my step daughters, it will be a late Valentine's Day gift."
1,I was hesitant to purchase this only because there are knock-offs that are a lot cheaper. The Red Ruby is absolutely beautiful & the 14k Gold makes it jump right out at you. :) The pictures do not show the beauty of this heart! I am Completely Satisfied with this purchase.Shipping was free & yet it still arrived quickly!
1,"It's a quality product with good craftsmanship, that I ordered for myself. Its a great addition to my jewerly collection but I had concerns about the thickness of the chain. Its pretty thin and could use a slightly thicker chain. I would definately order one again but would get a thicker chain to support it for everyday wear."
1,"the 18"" chain is a bit too thin, so the pendant flips around... but if you put it on a chain that is a bit thicker it looks amazing!"
0,"Product looks great and is nicely constructed, the issue is that it falls forward when worn due to design flaw. Also the end of the tail get caught on and breaks chains. We solved the issue by having a hoop added to the top of the piece in order to pass the chain through. My wife loves it but if I had to do over I would not purchase again, adding the hoop and having broken 2 chains is just too much hassle for a $160 pendant."
0,The way the chain is strung through the back makes it flip over too easily. Might have to add some sort of weight to the bottom or bend the mounts up a little to get it to stay in place.
1,I had been looking for something special to send to my girlfriend for Christmas. I wanted something that would reflect how much I appreciated all the support and encouragement that she had given me during the last year as I struggled through Paramedic school.The pendant is great quality and arrived timely
1,"I had one like this before but my daughter and her friend broke it and used it as play food in her kitchen...and the other one was more than twice the cost of this one...im quite happy with it...its simple, seems to be durable, and a great price...thank you!!"
1,"My mother had a stroke and only has use of one arm so she felt she could no longer wear any braclets. She loves this and loves the feal of the stones and enjoys rolling them between her fingers, it helps to calm her."
1,The bracelet matches the amethyst beaded necklace & I love it. Great buy for the money.
1,"Didn't say what size when I was looking for s yellow beaded bracelet, just took a chance. It's a little big for a six inch wrist, but it is very pretty."
1,"I love this ring. It is really large, but it looks much better in person than on the picture. It's high quality too."
1,"I bought this for my Mother as a Mother's Day gift. I really liked the way it looked in the pictures here, but sometimes it's hard to know if an item will look as good once you have it in your hand. WELL - according to my Mother, this was absolutely and brilliantly stunning. She said the shine and sparkle from this was amazing and it was gorgeous. She said she gets compliments every time she wears it, which is frequently!If you want to send this as a gift, have no qualms about it - as long as your recipient likes shiny and sparkly."
1,"This is a very sweet gift at an affordable price. My niece really liked this gift, she wore it during her graduation."
1,This was purchased as a wedding ring and my wife loves it. Highly recommended!
1,"We bought this for our daughter's 4th birthday, and it was one of her favorite gifts. She loves putting special things in it (and her jewelry, of course).I've been surprised, because it is VERY durable. Our two-year-old wants to play with it anytime she goes in her sister's room. And our toddler is a bit rough with it, but the box, fairy figure, and musical pieces are all in great shape. It's been nearly a year now with both kids playing with it almost daily.We looked at several before buying this one, but the price was great, and it's been a big hit for both our girls. I'm very glad we bought it."
0,Bought this as a gift for my 8 year old. It seems to be exactly as described. The quality is good for the price. My daughter loves it and it seems to have a fairly decent space for her to keep her jewelry and treasures in.
1,"It is not very durable, but sooo pretty. My 2 years old daughter loves dancing girl and music. We keep pins and rubber bands inside. It keeps her busy while I'm making her hair. Love it!"
1,"I really love this music box, cute ornament with nice dress and nice music. Lots of space for all my jewelry makings."
1,"for my toddler who loves music boxes and fairies. easy for her to open and close repeatedly. she enjoys playing with it. if she breaks it, not big deal it didn't cost much!"
1,a lil girl's dream come true - shipped quickly - packaging durable - arrived as stated it would... hours of pleasure for our 4 yr old.... affordability a plus - sturdy
1,"this fairy tale jewelry box is perfect for a little ballerina's first jewelry box, especially if you love fairies! Can't wait 'til Christmas to give them to my granddaughters."
1,"I love these eyelets, they are great for a new stretch and are very easy to sleep in."
1,"I admitedly felt a little cheap getting this for my girlfriend, but once it arrived, I was quite happy. I showed my mother to get her opinion(who also has a January birthday), and she was instantly jealous! Here my father was worried anything under $1,000 would be too cheap for her! My girlfriend? She loved it, too"
1,"I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. It is beautiful. Exactly as in the picture, just lovely. Thank you."
1,This is such a beautiful piece! It sparkles just right.
0,"While this is a beautiful piece of jewlery and my experiences with Silver Insanity have been great - it is HUGE! I expected the ""ball"" would be the size of a marble, but it is the size of a jaw breaker. It does state the size in the description, but I guess I just didn't read it. So , I will be sending mine back."
1,"This is a great ring for the price! Looks good and feels on the finger. Excellent service from Old Glory, too!Cut-out Celtic Knot - Sterling Silver Ring"
0,"I love geckos and thought the ring was awesome so I got it and found that the ring was very big. I ordered a size too small on purpose so I could put it on my pinkie but it's on my thumb because it is huge! Also the ring rips your clothing, bags, or blankets. The feet get caught on the fabric and rip it. I eventually had to completely stop wearing it because it was causing me so many problems."
1,Its awesome but really i kinda hate writing a review about this item when i already finished rating about this dam item
0,It kept on pinching the back of my neck at first and it also gets snagged in my hair. Even though it was amazing when I was inuyasha's fangirl
1,Me
0,"I ordered this, but got something totally different in the mail. They credited me and I sent the jewelry back but told them I still wanted the trumpet necklace. Never received it."
1,This pendant looks as good as the picture and comes with an adjustable black cord necklace that is so cool. I am so happy I got this and Dan's gave me some great service.
0,"Overall the ring looks fine, I think its colorful in good way. However, when I received the ring the middle stone moved. Now I'm left to either pay more to ship it back and hope for a new ring to be returned (hoping it will be made well), or I must have a professional fix it. Either way I don't think its worth any more money to return, or to get fixed. If they would have sent me a good ring that was made well(without moving stones), I would have enjoyed the ring (now its a pain.)"
0,"The colors of this ring are deceiving in this image. I thought this was going to be a fun going out ring, but when I received it, I discovered that the colors are so muted; it looks like an engagement ring. I'm not going to wear a $24.99 engagement ring.If you're looking for a colorful going out ring, this is not it."
1,May buy more! the handy pocket hold a smart phone. Zipper is great for money and slots for any kind of cards. I use it at work for notes and a place for my phone.
1,"I ordered this ring and debated between 2 sizes. It arrived and was beautiful, but I had chosen the wrong size. The ring arrived in less than a week. I contacted the seller about an exchange. Mailed the ring back and in 8 days had the replacement ring. It is beautiful and so comfortable. I wear it and hardly know I have it on, although it is a solid ring. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
1,"This ring is beautiful. I am allergic to gold, and I wanted something that I would not get an allergic reaction to yet was feminine and beautiful. I found it in this ring. The seller was true to their word!"
1,After purchsing this ring I have been asked multiple times if the ring is paltinum or white gold. I decline to give them the correct answer. My best friends reaction was that ring had to of set you back a nice amount of money. If they only knew that this purchase with its quality cost me under fifty dollars they would be shocked and embarrassed.
0,"We bought these rings because we loved the design, but we don't feel that they are very comfortable at all. The edge is too sharp, and it feels a little too thick. The actual ring is a lot darker than the picture shown."
1,"My boyfriend was really sad because he did not have a ring and I did have a promise ring, so I got him this one for his birthday. He loves it! It's just just shiny enough that he won't lose it and just strong enough to deal with his stupidity. I highly recommend this ring to anyone who is cheap :DP.S. Do not bite it, it will break your teeth."
0,"Its a really nice ring, seems durable, ive had it for two hours and i put it on and the edges are so sharp, maybe my fingers are more webbed then normal but it hurts to much to wear :( so nice.. but oh well.. i recommend to any female interested.. it looks like a male ring... its dosent mean it is, but its as thick as a male ring and it has a more masculine look. also the edges hurt so when thinking about buying this, take into consideration its not ganna wear well on your fingers... other then that, i wish i could wear it."
1,This ring has beautiful craftsman ship and a great design. It is very comfortable to wear and not to heavy of a ring.
1,I got this ring so when the right guy wanted to propose to me he didn't have to spend the money he probably didn't have. My now Fiance used it to ask me to merry him over a water fall on Christmas. It was very romantic
0,Its a good ring. However it is extremely light. I like heavy rings so i didn't really care for it. It also has an edge to it that is a bit uncomfortable.
1,This ring is wonderful and it was the best fit. The inside of the ring is so smooth and the design is just beautiful.
1,to find a ring that fits my my husband is wonderful - to find an attractive titanium ring that will stand up to his hard work is also wonderful. The company shipped quickly and safely - husband is finding the ring to fit comfortably
1,Looks just like the picture. Very happy with this ring. Very light weight as well. Does not look cheap at all.
0,Of plastic I purchase my fiance's ring the dragon one and this one at the same time when they came I open his first and I was like really excited because it felt and looked like I spent a lot more $$$ than I did but then I open this one and I was shocked it just feels like I went to my corner store and took 25 cents and got me a ring thankfully this is just an add on to ring and wedding band wanted one that was matching to my fiance's) so I am not going through the whole process of returning. I guess I should have listen to my gut felling when I saw 'titanium' oh well The seller is awesome and it was shipped right away!!
1,Chinese characters are my favorite. Made sturdy and I like the adjustable length. The pendant is nice but I would prefer it a little smaller. But I would recommend this product.
1,I have waited a long time to get this necklace. It was totally worth it. I love this necklace. It is truly a lovely work of art. The carnelian stones vary in color but do so in a way that enhance the overall appearance of the necklace. The drop on the necklace enhances the d&eacute;colletage. I enjoy wearing this necklace.
0,I like them but they are very small. Cute little studs. Because they are so small it's hard to notice the detail of the bats but I think it serves the point good enough.
0,I have purchased this pendant years ago and still own it today. It's a small pendant and the diamonds are not that sparkly.
0,"The item I received is not the same color or shape to what is pictured online. The product was also delayed in shipping, which was addressed by customer service in a timely fashion. I'm mostly dissatisfied that the color of the stone is so different, which is a deep blue with small hint of green. I bought it as a present for my girl friend as opal is her birthstone. I've looked through literally hundreds of earrings and now I'm not even confident I'm giving her her birthstone. If it wasn't a time concern, I'd promptly return the earrings I received."
1,"I love these earrings so much! They are understated but really pretty, and are the perfect size."
1,I love celestial items and saw this ring at a great price. It is just as beautiful as I had hoped. I love it! Looks even better than the picture! It arrived quickly and in good order. Wonderful purchase.
1,"I love it - it is the perfect size, chain length and just as beautiful in person as in the picture."
1,"I was looking for a small necklace that I could wear every day and this is very suitable. It is small, but if that's what you want you should be pleased with it."
1,The girl who accepted my gift told me that's the exact model what shes been looking for.
0,"Don't bother ordering this item because you will be sorely disappointed. I ordered this link and my card was promptly charged, but the link that was sent instead was an ""angel"" link that was completely different and only priced at half what I had been charged. Pugster does not answer the customer service line during their posted hours, and when they do choose to respond to emails do not want to address the error of having sent the wrong item. Pugster finally decided to respond and send a replacement only after I had to have Amazon intervene for a refund, and the replacement link was STILL wrong!!! I now have 2 poorly designed angel links and no music note link. Unbelievably poor service. Product received is not even close to what is represented in the picture - not even music related in any way. Company refuses to admit that there is an obvious error in their warehouse. Definitely not worth the time or hassle of ordering."
1,"This item having a black background really looks great. I wear a good deal of black, and it goes with everything. Good buy, good price, gets a very good rec from me."
0,This is the most pathetic excuse for a piece of jewellery I think I've ever seen. The blurb says it's a good size for men. What kind? 3 feet tall pygmies? I tried it on and only just got it on my little finger. The photo that accompanies the Amazon blurb does not show that the skull is completely hollow. This gets my vote in the Bernie Maddof Awards for Integrity in Product Credibility. Minus 10 stars. Junk.
1,Looks terrific on and can adds alot of sparkle and color. very easy to wear.
1,"It is the most beautiful cross I have even seen. Its pure platinum would make it very sturdy. With a platinum chain, it would be the perfect necklace."
1,"I bought these after wearing a pair of my dad's that he bought in the 70's. They are almost identical and made of similar materials.I am very happy with the size, finish and style. Very fun Links. Enjoy them."
1,"nice cufflinks , the production also is good such as the material so i rate them with 5 stars and the value rate is resolvable too"
1,"We first saw these cuff links in a shop window in France. The ones we ordered from Cuff Daddy were a match, but much less expensive. They arrived as promised in a lovely presentation box."
1,my wife loved this its beautiful great quality great price we had it taken to zales to verify that the diamonds were real due to the price and they sure are
1,I gave this to my sister for a Christmas present. She loved it and wears it all the time. Very Beautiful.
0,"...to buy a clasp for this necklace if you are over the age of 2 and want to actually wear it. Unfortunately, this necklace has no clasp, (as seen in the picture), but is not long enough to be pulled over an adult sized head.I am not giving it a lower ranking because I could have paid attention to the item length in the description; however, it is annoying I am going to have to do work on it to wear it or send it back.The pendant itself is not completely yellow like as seen in the picture. The pendant is the color of spilled honey which has started to crystallize. The smaller beads are the same color as the picture; the larger ones are more amber colored.EDIT TO ADD -I can, in fact, get this over my head by dipping my face forward and rolling the necklace over the back of my skull. Good thing I don't have the kind of hair that is easily tangled."
1,"This is a very nice ring. The diamond is a little larger than I expected and I love the sleek simplicity of the unique style. This would make an excellent promise ring, but I bought it for myself just because I thought it was very pretty! I give it 5 stars because it met what I wanted and a little more."
1,This anklet arrived as pictured marked 925. It tinkles nicely and looks very fashionable on. The seller shipped super fast and packaged it in a cute silver box. Would do business with this seller again.
0,Too expensive for what's offered. Anyone could easily make this. It's not all that safe for children because it's flimsy.
0,"Really liked the looks of it on the picture, but was very disappointed to see it in reality. The quality of the cuts in the bone is very poor, it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise interesting design."
0,"I got this italian horn for my husband for Valentines Day and when he opened it, it was tarnished and looked like crap. [...] This is not real sterling silver!!!! TRUST ME!!!"
1,These earrings are beautiful. I purchased two pairs as gifts for my daughter and daughter-in-law. They were both blown away by the size of the pearls and they looked great on their ears. I would purchase them again.
1,"These earings came in a nice soft poutch to protect their luster and eclosed in a very hard jewelry box for more protection. As stated, they are very nice. I'm no expert on pearls but I could see no blemishes or marring of any kind. They made a great gift for my mother, especially at this price you can't beat it."
1,"These earrings arrived ""lightening fast"", and were very well packaged in a sturdy small mailing box, within which was a nice blue gift box, within which was a blue velour drawstring bag containing the earrings. The earrings look just as I expected. They are a ivory/white color and have a pearly sheen to them, which you can't really see in the example photo. (Pearls can have an irridescence look to them. ) I bought this set on Gold Box special for around $20, and they are more than worth it. The shape of each pearl i recieved is close to perfect, and there are just a few very tiny flaws (little ""dents"") in the surface that are so miniscule I had to look really close-up to even find them. The diameter of my pearls is 6.5 mm , which is almost exactly the diameter of the end of a standard pencil eraser. I have med-sized earlobes for a 5'2"" person, and I think these pearls are proportioned nicely for my face - even are a tiny bit larger than I might have thought to buy in person. The posts are a generous length too, which is good becuase they will poke me in the head if I go to sleep and forget to take them off ! I wish i could have bought 3 sets (extras for gifts), but the particular sale only allowed one set per person..."
1,I always wanted to buy 14K yellow gold pearl studs. When I saw this on sale I did not hesitate to buy. I'm so glad I did. These pearls are gorgeous and are perfect for office use or when going out. The studs are very dainty and have the right shine.
0,They came in a paper box and black fake velvet bad. Really not gift worthy. Had to spend more money just to be able to give them to my niece for Christmas.
0,"The pearls I received looked nothing like the picture. The pearls in the picture has nice luster with a pink hue and what looks to be medium nacre. I understand that every pearl is different so I can only speak to the pair of pearl earrings I received. The pair of earrings I got were white (no hue), a chalky luster and a very thin nacre coating that can quickly peel, crack or simply wear off. I agree with one of the reviewers that it looks fake, just like the kind you buy for a 4 year old child. I think the picture is very misleading, but commend Amazon for making returns easy."
0,These pearls do not match each other in size and color.The box and bag that contain the earrings look cheap.
0,It is not what the picture look like. They are too small. The color is white which the picture is light pink.
1,I got them for my friend on her birthday. They came in a plain white box. I put them in a Macys box I had for better presentation. The gift was well appreciated.
1,i bought these earrings for my 14 year old daughter. she absolutely loves them!! the pearls have a beautiful luster. the shape is perfect. the pearls are just the right size for the girl with smaller/medium ears. an excellent buy
1,"This has to be my fifth pair of Akoya 7mm earrings. If I could keep my daughters out of my bathroom, they'd last longer. These are well made, with sturdy and secure backs. I just love them. The size is perfect for wearing with jeans or even an evening out. They are not too large that they droop on my ear lobe... very nice look and good craftsmanship. The pair I received had no visible flaws - and very nice luster, and this pair has a pink blush to them. They're not Mikimoto quality, but much nicer than I see at Zales or most of the mall jewelry stores - and you can't beat the price. For $19, I wish I'd bought three pair."
1,"The color, length of the post are perfect. Great price too. Would give them as a gift. I wear them frequently."
1,This was a gift from a very special person and they are absolutely beautiful. The price was very affordable and the perals were so luminous. Very pleased and excited about purchase.
1,"These area good looking, quality earrings that look better in person than I expected. They are comfortable and well made."
1,These are really pretty and a great size and price. They go with everything and look great. I would definitely buy them again
1,I never got to see them sent them to my sister for her birthday 22. Well she loved them my mom said she has them on a lot. She said they are classy!!
0,"Don't buy!! Looks pink in picture and bigger, turns out they were small and white, not what I wanted or expected at all."
0,I received this Italian horn in pristine condition and I was completely satisfied with the receiving of this product in a timely manner.
1,This was the first time I ordered from Silverspeck and was very pleased with the product. I purchased it for my sister-in-law's birthday and she was thrilled. The bracelet is very elegant and feels like great quality jewelry. She wore it with a dressy outfit and then left it on with a more casual look and it worked for both. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,"I live in LA where the whole Goth-rocker thing is SOOOOO played-out, trite, co-opted and tired. Nice middle-aged Beverly Hills homemakers and preppie princesses wear diamond-encrusted skull jewelry to their Botox appointments, or to get the Lexus detailed--i mean, shut UP! Still, I have a deadly attraction to the calavera, always have. I love these tiny earrings so much that i bought 2 prs. The skull itself is delicate and tiny-- just a dot which is no larger than the head of a dressmaker's straight -pin, yet the detail is good. Unless someone has REALLY good eyesight, it just looks like a tiny silver stud. I have only 3 ear-holes (not the requisite 17 or 34 or whatever here in the Valley of Posers)-- and i always wear this tiny skull in the third, ""extra"" hole. Even with a conservative suit and pumps, when I am out doing bidness with The Man. It's funny and subversive to me to be wearing skull jewelry under the radar. For years, I wore the huge Keith Richards ring, but this is cooler."
1,"I was looking for some cute little stud earrings and I came across these. They had good reviews and the price was pretty good too. The only thing I was worried about was how they looked in the picture and a lot of people were saying they were extremely tiny. I was very pleased once I got them; they look a lot better in person and aren't as small as I thought which is good but still tiny which is also good :) They are adorable and I love them! Not to mention I received these extremely fast! Thumbs up, I recommend these. I am not considering piercings my ears a second time because these would like great in the second hole."
1,I bought these and wore them for years until I lost one of them. These are great earrings for a small touch of skull.
1,"This is a cute keepsake item for 1st time mom. A little heavy. But, it was cute and easy to put on."
1,I picked this bracelet out and put it on a list for my husband to choose from for me for Mother's Day. I absolutely love it and have received many compliments. The combination of tiger's eye and turquoise is interesting and beautiful. I have not taken it off (literally!) in a month and have had no problems with the clasp or with it not being sturdy. It's a winner!
0,"I was so happy when I saw these pair of earrings on amazon shopping list & my daughter just got her ears pierce, so I could have it as a Christmas give for her. Turn out the purple pink colors is not colors at all & it is just all white crystal around it. I was very disappoint."
1,"Bought the ring as a Christmas present. The ex threw it back in my face. We are no longer together. Hate the ring, hate the ex!"
0,The item doesn't hang right unless maybe you have a prefect stomach. I really like the pattern but it is a top drop which makes it funky.
1,The ring arrived in a timely fashion and was of great quality for the price
1,"I absolutely love this ring! It is gorgeous. I got it in a 9 so that I can wear it in the summertime when none of my rings fit, and it'll work wonderfully. The design is beautiful and so far is proving to be sturdy. The band is a little thin in spots, but as long as it isn't abused it'll be fine. The shipping took a little longer than stated, but it arrived in excellent condition. I am very pleased with this ring and would totally recommend it."
0,Ring design does not go all the way around. Not shown or referenced. Misleading and they only offer refund of purchase - not a correction or providing ring as advertised. Beware!! Most likely other ring designs too do not go all the way around.
0,"I am pleased with the pendant but very dissatisfied with it as a necklace. In its description it clearly says, and I quote, ""Comes ready to wear with a jewelry black rope necklace"", well only if you have an EXTREMELY small head. The small black rope doesn't open nor adjust, making it absolutely impossible to wear it as a necklace! I bought this as a gift for my graduating piano student and won't be able to use it."
1,"Got this for a christmas present to a friend, and it was beautiful! The color was bright, the writing in gold was very neat, and he has worn it every day since I gave it to him in december, it is now july and it has not worn out or broken. I am now planning on buying myself one, because it is such good quality, although the necklace itself is a little short for some necks."
1,"THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE FOR ME AS I WEAR MORE THAN ONE PAIR AT A TIME.I HAVE MORE THAN 7 PIERCINGS ON MY EARS AND I'VE NO TIME FOR BROKEN EARRINGS.OR EARRINGS THAT FALL OFF.FOR THIS PRICE SABRINA CO. OFFERS BEAUTIFUL,QUALITY AND DURABLE EARRINGS.THESE EARRINGS ARE STILL AMONG MY FAVORITESABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED!"
1,"I often wear these in my second ear piercing, behind a pair of 18k huggies, that look exactly alike these, only 2mm larger. They would look nice on their own as well. These are easy to sleep in, therefore a perfect travel earring."
1,"I purchased these earrings and they are perfect. very shiny and classy looking. I ordered them Dec 30 and recieved them Jan 3 very quick to recieve, thank you cindy from Iowa"
1,"My sister loved the ring and wanted to know where in the world I found it. It was shiny, a little thing but the perfect gift! Quick shipping and cute as a button. Thanks kindly!"
1,"This is a delicate but sturdy chain, perfect for a lightweight pendant. I am very pleased with this purchase."
1,I bought this because my son broke my current chain. I love the box chain necklaces because they are strong and pretty. I have never had a issue with the box chain necklaces breaking. So I found this and bought it for my charms of my children and it looks beautiful. I love it. Perfect length for me. I love long chains the short ones drive me crazy.
1,"Very comfortable, as a matter of fact so comfy I have had them on for three days. Great style!"
1,"The bracelet is beautiful but I took a chance ordering with no length info.It is 7 1/4"" long and I prefer 7 1/2"" , but rather than returning it, I willgive it as a gift and be more careful in the future."
1,"Before you purchase this or any item, for that matter, make a template ofearring to be sure size is what you want. Solid silver earrings, made beautifully."
1,This pendant is more beautiful in person than the picture. It is very well made and has substantial weight to it. I was very impressed with the quality and workmanship of this item. I will definitely purchase from this seller again.
1,This little cross is very delicate and lovely. It's the perfect size for teens and even adults. I love Black Hills Gold and this is just another great product from them. The only negative is that because it is so small the detailing of the different colors of metals is hard to see.
1,"I bought this band to wear stacked with another band I have, sort of as an enhancer for it and it looks great. I was a little nervous about ordering jewelry online but I felt that with the excellent price and Amazon's reputation I could take that chance. This ring is equal to what you would buy in a jewelry store. It has a nice weight for the thinness and a very nice shine. Basically, what you see is what you get. It looks exactly the same as the picture. I would advise trying on a ring of the same thickness at a jewelry store to make sure this is the width you want. You will also realize what a great price Amazon has! I am very pleased with this purchase."
0,well i finally got it the shipping was really really quick as far as the item goes iam a huge pirate fan and i have all the rings and other necklaces but this replica looks kind of cheap its really small(the coin)and it looks like plastic and the finishing color looks like copper instead if gold also the necklace is extreamly cheap i switched it to a gold ball link chain i took from my celling fan also the price is rediculus its 10 sumtin but the shipping comes up to 20 $ and my friend bought a much realistic one and larger coin for 20 $ at a disney store so its deffinetly not worth buying im pretty disapointed
1,"I ended up buying 3 of these after I bought 2 for my boys, my husband wanted one to collect."
1,"This is my favorite Christmas prezent of ALL TIME!!! I think the reason this is always soo rare is because no one can get enough of it! Even at a high price it still fills joy in the eyes to just lay them apon it! I luv it soo much, my second favourite item after my autographed pic of Orlando Bloom that he, himself sent me!!"
1,"I was looking to coordinate with a lab-created padparadscha pendant I had, and love the earrings. The color may be just a tad less red-orange than the necklace, and is more of an orange (but that is what it was described to be, so I am not finding fault.) I don't like things to be overly matchy, so it worked fine and I like the earrings a lot. I haven't worn them yet, but know I'll look fab in them!"
0,"Not quite those expensive lacquer boxes you might find in import stores and boutiques. The sides seams were splitting and were coming off when it arrived, making it useless as a Christmas present. I am not sure how they're sourcing these, but you get what you pay for in this case."
1,"my son is 6 months old and this towel has been the perfect size since birth. NOT a whimpy, thin, small baby towel at all. It'll probably last until he is about a year old. Then, it might be too small."
1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my GF and she loved it. She even complained about how it out shines her other jewelry! So far, the build quality is very good and my GF has been wearing it all the time. It was bigger than I expected it to be. Only negative is that it comes in a cheap small pouch, in case it's been bought as a gift.Great buy"
1,"I had metal allergy, so I was looking for nickel-free chain. I bought 18"", and it's good length for me. Fast shipping, good packing. I really like it, and am happy because I don't need to wear old silver chain.(Of course, it includes nickel!)"
0,"Teeny Tiny, with one of those chains that is so thin that it gets tied up in knots if you so much as look at it.I returned it.Mairead"
1,"Very cute little necklace. Diamond is very small and a little on the dark side, but it is a J-K color, so is expected. Chain is very fragile looking but hasn't broken yet. Very dainty and feminine, will go well paired up with another small necklace. Love it and is just as pictured. Would def recommend."
1,"This was a last-minute added gift idea and I worried it would not be shipped on time, but it arrived quicker than planned. The bracelet is beautiful...well worth the money and I would certainly shop this way again. I was VERY happy with this transaction!"
1,This is great. Its just the right size and holds anything you need. Its deffinitely worth the money and is great for hanging bangles on.
1,The perfect bracelet holder rack!!! Simple-looking but cute and great design - doesn't take much space in my luggage or in my closet! Found it on Ebay for twice the price. So happy I got it on Amazon for half the price plus fast/free shipping =)
1,This is exactly what I was looking for and I am able to store a great amount of bracelets and still have easy access to each one.
1,Really nice and lovely earrings
1,The quality of these earrings is excellent. They were originally bought as a gift but I liked them so much I also bought some for myself.
0,"The metal looks like it was poured into a mold so looks a little to manufactured. I was hoping for a little irregularity that would make it look more handmade ... still, I am sure my wife will love it."
1,"Beautifully crafted! Perfectly crafted, and includes a sterling silver hook, for those with nickel allergies! A perfect gift! (That's how I received it)"
1,These earrings are beautiful and I plan on purchasing the necklace that goes with them. They were received promtly and in excellant condition.
0,"I waited too long for delivery. It took nearly 2 weeks for me to received a shipment that supposedly shipped the same or next day. I received a ring that was much larger in size than the order specified, and the band was bent. I requested a size 10, and the bandwidth of the item I received exceeded the size 10 bandwidth on the ring sizing chart.I returned the ring via certified mail and requested an exhange. The return was confirmed received on Friday 3 August. The vendor kindly informed me that the order would be processed and shipped on Monday 6 August. Except for the flawed band & wrong size, I like the design and alloy. But if this order takes more than a week to receive, I will not purchase from this merchant again because the delivery time does not justify the original shipping cost. Moreover, if the exchange is sized incorrectly or the band is bent, I will request a refund."
0,I was very disappointed that when I got this item it was bent. It took a long time to try and return it also.
1,I ordered this set because I have a moonstone ring with a pear shaped stone and this matched it beautifully! It is even prettier in person and well packaged! You could give it as a gift straight out of the box.
1,"Actually bought these to go with the single strand Onyx Bead necklace. But I ended up liking the earrings to wear alone. Very simple but elegant. Silver and Black always looks elegant, can be dressed down or up. Great for work, with or without the matching necklace. A great deal."
0,"I was very disappointed in this product, it looked like something you might get out of a gumball machine. No stones at all and is just thin plastic like silver? Misleading picture, it doesn't look like it at all!! I wouldn't have paid $2.00! I am going to return it right away. What a waste of time and money!! No star if i could!!"
1,I've ordered from Pugster before and I will do it again. Great quality and great delivery time!!
1,bought this bracelet for my girlfriend she loves it its beautiful and its worth the money!!
0,Earrings are a good size but the stones look pretty cheap. Up close they look dirty and scratched. Save your money.
0,Very cheaply made and fell apart within a month. Save yourself the aggravation and spend a little more for a better piece!
1,The necklace was much nicer than it is pictured in the ad. I was exceptionally pleased when it arrived. I have seen similar items sell for considerably more. Service was great; item arrived quickly well packed and in great shape. Way to go!
1,"The earrings were great, just what I was looking for. They are bigger in person than on the picture, but again just what I looking for. Very durable."
1,"These earrings are absolutely gorgeous. The size is perfect, and they sparkle like real diamonds! I get a compliment every time I wear them."
1,"I've been looking for cz earrings that could maybe pass for the real thing - well . . .these are outstanding!! I will wear them around the holidays, but for every day wear they are just too big a 'statement' for me:) I will be reordering in a smaller size, but not sure about the friction backs (they bother my ears). But don't hesitate to purchase these earrings in a size that is just right for you - you will NOT be disappointed!"
1,These earrings look wonderful and are quite big and noticable. The zirconia sparkes wonderfully in sunlight. I think they are a great value at this price. I got one pair for me and another for a gift. My friend liked them a lot.
0,I had them for a week and the gem started to get loose and then finally it fell out after about a week and a half.... DO NOT BUY THESE!
1,"These are perfect, love the size (not HUGE but big enough to be noticed)! I am happy with the quality and price of these as well. These are great, everyday earrings. I had these on my wish list forever and am glad I finally got them."
1,"I was skeptical at first due to the pictures and the price. I still was skeptical on the size once I received it, but the style and the brightness of the Cubic Zirconia ease my mind and especially, when until I saw them on my daughter - It was perfect in every way and I couldn't ask for more."
1,These were the size that she wanted (she has several piercings on each ear/would have preferred the 3mm size but she made do! Nice color and clarity.
1,"These earrings are great quality and I get positive comments on them very often. They go with everything, dressing up or down... I would recommend to anyone wanting a great pair of earrings at a great value. --One of many purchases from this seller"
1,I was very pleased with the quality of the pearls. They were just the right size and the description was very accurate. They were delivered ahead of the estimated arrival date. I would definitely purchase from this company again.
1,"I received these earrings yesterday (7/15/11) and immediately put them on. They are a little bigger than I am used to, but they are simply gorgeous. I only noticed on teeny tiny flaw (they earrings came out of their position in the box en route, so I suspect the earring was nicked while inside the box). Otherwise, a great buy for the price."
1,"These earrings are fantastic. They are so small and they look great on. They are the perfect size, not too big or too small. I love them and wear them everyday."
1,"These studs are cute--perfect size, good quality, and inexpensive. I have a white pair and a black pair that I can switch up for any occasion. I'm looking forward to wearing the white ones with my Dahlia white pearl bracelet for my wedding. :)"
1,"this earing is perfect for how simple and elegant it is, i am actually wearing it for my wedding. i was completely happy with it."
1,"One of the most prompt services we have ever experienced. Beautiful large white cultured pearl stud earrings -quite as described, and gorgeous looking! Thank you, Dahlia."
0,These are nicely made but are rather small and the detail is hard to see with out getting really close. From a distance they look more like a flower than a group of skulls.
0,Picture has the incorrect diamond.Didn't think the diamond would be puny small as a nose stud diamond and it's hanging from those claws(not even touching the bottom).
1,The earrings I purchase were wonderful! They were exactly as stated on the website and the shipping was very prompt. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.
1,So happy with the earrings. Were exactly as promoted and arrived right on time. Would certainly recommend this seller.
1,I was skeptical when i ordered these. but once they came in the mail i fell in LOVE! also everyone who has seen me with them on loved them!
1,"These are very lovely pearl earrings. The color looks more pink than lavendar, but can't complain. It's a perfect size. Can be worn dressed up or dressed down. I just love it."
1,"I am not a big pearl lover but I believe that just changed with these lovely lavender pearl studs. I was also truly impressed that the posts had the notches in them so that the earring would not back out. Simple, lovely and can be worn with any type outfit! Stunning."
1,great barbell. its held up through the test of time. still looks like the day i got it. the thing i really like about this gemmed barbell is that the gem is not too jagged. often times you get a barbell with a gem in it and they want it to be cut to look a lot like a gem and if youre putting this in your TONGUE you really dont want a jagged barbell.this barbell however is not jagged and didnt cut the roof of my mouth like others in the past that i have had. its withheld its quality over time and Its a great purchase.
1,"this necklace surely deserves a 5 star rating! i am more than satisfied with this product, it sparkles so bright and it is definitely an eye catcher :) the colors are beautiful and the chain is a very nice sturdy chain, not cheap!!! outstanding for the price, LOVE IT!"
1,"I purchased 5 of these for my bridesmaids. The chain is very good quality, and sturdy silver. The crystal cluster is also very nice and held together with clear, sturdy string. They come separated for you to put together yourself, which could allow for you to use the chain for mulitple charms. This also allows the cluster to slide along the chain, and it's inserted per gaps allowed in the center of each side of the cluster. The cluster is also larger than it looks on the website, and is a good size. This still worked for me since my girls are wearing strapless dresses, though. I would recommend this necklace, but be sure you aren't looking for something very small and simple for an already busy outfit. The different colors in the cluster are also very nice, so the pink isn't too strong."
1,"I am so glad I found these beautiful pink pearl and swarovski crystal earrings. They could not be any more perfect than they are and are exactly what I was looking for. They are just beautiful with the pink pearl necklace I have and the price was super. They also come in other colors and I hope to be able to purchase the blue pearl earrings soon. The colors of these earrings are a beautiful shade of pink and blue and definitely a bonus in my jewelry collection. If you need a beautiful pair of earrings, I would definitely recommend these pearl earrings from Gem Avenue through Amazon.com."
1,"I absolutely love them...they look fantastic even through the plastic wrap:))) seriously, I am so excited to wear them, colors are stunning and they are even little bigger than I expected. They made my day today"
1,I was very pleased with these earring's which are to be a Christmas gift for my Daughter-in-law who loves the color pink. The earrings are well made with quality materials and could be worn either with formal attire or to add sparkle to a casual outfit. I am certain that they will be appreciate and am happy with this purchase.
0,"I bought this because I needed a simple, pretty pearl pendant. The pearl is wonderfull, however I am not impressed with the bail (the piece that slides onto the chain). It is not as substantial as I thought it would be, and flips upsidown so the smaller pinched end is on the chain and the larger end is holding the pearl, which looks funny and annoys me. Nor was I impressed with the chain it came with (a bit thin and flimsy). Luckily I have a few extra chains I was able to switch with the first one. But that being said, I get plenty of wonderfull comments when I wear it."
1,"This ring is really cool. It's a darker opal color, so it's good for either a man or a woman. The shipping was fast and it came in a nice box. I highly recommend this ring & this vendor who has many other jewelery products equal in quality!"
0,"I did not receive an oval fresh water pink pearl. I received a smaller, round pearl. Not at all what I wanted.I am very disappointed. Would not order from this site again."
0,"These are pretty, but not as big as the description stated. The dangle is 15mm high and 8mm wide. As I suspected, the description includes the earwire in the length."
1,This leather bracelet was very nice. It was just what they said it would be.
1,"The ring is true to size and very thick and durable. I will note that as with any stone jewelry, be careful notto ever drop it on hard surfaces. The ring is beautiful and I am very happy with this purchase!"
0,"The ring looks very nice, but the quality is not so nice. This was the second time I have purchased this ring for my husband. He is a man that talks with his hands, both times he was pointing to something on a table and voila, the ring broke into many pieces. Needless to say we are going to get a quality metal this time. If you are gentle with your hands, this ring may work. It is a nice looking ring, but you get what you pay for."
1,"I ordered the ring for my girlfriend. When I saw the picture I was not that impressed. The item came in within 2 business days. I was amazed, but when my girlfriend open the beautiful small box that came in (Actually she still have the box. She loved the box too!) the ring was amazing! The shine was superb and the look is wonderful. She loves it and I was impressed in how the picture lacks the real looks of the ring. I highly recommend this ring and seller. I have ordered before from this seller and there has never been a problem."
1,"I absolutely love these rings. I'm allergic to most metals, so it's hard for me to find rings that I actually can wear. Though the hematite rings are very fragile, you just have to be extra careful if you're going to take it off and put it somewhere. It has a beautifully shiny metallic luster and looks fantastic. Great product!"
1,"It broke on me, but i loved this ring and I didn't care that it broke because it did it's job! It lasted for like 4 months, and people loved it! I am going to buy another one eventually. This ring was too amazing, it broke because I was rough housing, but it did take a lot of damage before, so it is fragile but NOT fragile at the same time, there were many times i punched a wall and it didn't break. I recommend it"
1,"I just love this ring, it's very comfortable and beautiful. I goes with any outfit, it's like a lil black dress for your fingers."
1,"Very well made, beautiful, and very affordable. These earrings are a great addition to my jewelry collection. I recommend this purchase."
0,"If you look closely at the pictures, the small figures are ghosts. I didn't figure this out until I ordered the product. When I complained to the Company, they told me I was the first to say this and they had sold thousands. I have a hard time believing that. The good thing was that the company was great about the return. My cost was the shipping for learning this lesson."
1,I love this ring. I receive many compliments on it each day. I wear it all the time and the stones are still as sparkling as the day I received it. I recommend it highly!
1,Bought it for my girlfriend and she just loved it.... Nice gift wrap and note were perfect details. Highly recommended...
1,"I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! This one has some bling to it which makes it a little more playful and even cuter! Love love love it!"
1,"Because my niece is a dachsund owner, I purchased this for her for Christmas. When it arrived, I was quite impressed with the detailing; it's small, but very nicely made. And my niece absolutely loved it!"
1,I had a hard time finding this charm. I am pleased with the item. It is exactly as described.
1,Good durable materials that don't irritate my skin like most metals :) I have been wearing these for over 6 months and have noticed no degrading of the metal.
0,"I got this locket as a gift for he holidays. When I got it I was shocked to say the least. First thing I noticed was the general look of the piece, which to be honest seemed off in comparison to the picture. The inside of the locket was the second thing. It was blank in the locket, just an ugly metallic look. Third thing that, in the end made me return the item, was clasp that held the door of the locket closed. To be blunt it didn't work. All in all I give the item a 2, only for the fact that it is technically a locket with pretty stones on it."
0,wow I never thought I'd have to write a review about a lapel but this one sure needs it. I love the look of it and I love that it has all 50 stars and 13 stripes but golly it sure fails in every duty of a lapel. The back of it falls off without even pulling on it. I tried to bend it a bit but it made no difference. I ended up just bending the needle flat and that stayed for all of two days 'till it fell off and now it's gone for good. I had it for about one week.
1,"Looked everywhere locally for this flag pin. This one is sturdy, easy to pin & receives many compliments from all who see it."
1,"This is it. The basic, no crazy waves or gimmicks, no flashing every day usage flag pin. This is the one you see on movie stars, celebrities and even the pres-o-dent. Don't be fooled by all the crazy flag pins out there, this is the one to get. Does the job and can go with every outfit to show your patriotic spirit."
0,"These would indeed be worth 5-stars except that the photo shows that they are not ""mirrored"" earrings- the left and right ears are not supposed to have the same earring when the design is assymetrical. Fine jewelery earrings are supposed to be ""mirrored""."
1,It went well with the bracelet I got for my wife and looks good on fair skinned and blonde headed people.
1,I just got this ring today and I simply love it. The craftsmanship is very well done on it. The two bands under it are adjustable so any finger will fit it. Even a mans finger if he just pulls the bands apart. There is a bit of weight to it being solid pewter so your finger might feel a bit weird after you take it off. Over all I really love this finger spike and am looking forward to getting another one but in a different style besides the stars on this one.
1,"Got them because they were gorilla glass and I like the transparent/colored look they have.The other reviewer noted they looked 'doll eye'ish, this is because the cap and the wear rod are the same glass material. The darker colored dot is where the glass rod connects to the cap part. I got two different colors, one in the blue and green, and different sizes. Lets people know how big your gauges are.Very smooth fit, the wear area wasn't long so they were comfortable enough to wear in my cartilage piercings at night without getting tugged by my pillow or jabbing my skull."
0,"These are good quality for what they are, but the problem I have with them is the look. What you can't really tell from the picture, is that the part of the cap that is flared out is basically transparent, with the center part that goes all the way through being darker. The effect is that they look like toy doll eyes. White circles with dark centers. They look pretty weird.I do like that they are of good build quality though. I would just prefer the whole cap to be the same color."
0,This is definitely not 4 cttw. A 2 ct diamond measures anywhere from 7 to 7.5 mm. So when I read the product detail saying that it measures 7.15 mm I thought this must be 4 cttw and that's why I ordered a pair. But I was so frustrated when I received the package because the diamond measured only 5.5 mm so it must be 2 cttw. I am returning this.
1,My parents were living in England. Not only was it shipped to them it was gift wrapped. My mom loved it. Just the right size and easy to attach to the bracelet I bought. Its very pretty!
1,"The compartment jewelry organizers are wonderful, they keep everything separated. The velvet lining keeps jewelry from being scratched or damaged."
1,"Beautiful craftsmanship in this ring. Sizing is accurate. Probably better for men (available sizing indicates this), as it is pretty thick."
1,Ring was just like the picture and fit perfectly to size. Love the blue waves. It was a perfect xmas gift!
1,skull necklace came fast and did not have any problems. Thanks for a smooth transaction.
1,"this is a nice looking ring and i do like the design. however i assumed it was connected or soldered together where the silver overlaps since there were different sizes. it is not connected and so the ring is unstable in my opinion and i am afraid that movement back and forth will sooner or later break the ring. sadly, i will be returning this one."
0,"These earrings looked perfect in the picture. They were well shaped and not too big. I am not a fan of large earrings. Their only failing is that they don't match in color. One of the earrings is almost black and the other is a little darker than royal blue. When you put them together, it looks like you put on one earring each from a different set. I have even had comments. I would say that you need to look for a different manufacturer that does a better job of matching the earring pair."
1,They look just as they appear in the pic.Can't wait to give to the person I bought them for.I would recommend.
1,I love this belly ring! This is my favorite one to wear1 The colors look amazing with anything! I'm a big fan of the multi color look now:)
1,"So easy to throw in the diaper bag and take along! Works great, and was shocked to find two in the box!"
0,This is a huge waste of money I had it for about a month when the part that holds the symbol to the necklace broke. I seriously not wasting your money on this low quality item
0,"Instead, this is the Caduceus--look it up. Nice try, guise, but no cigar. Not even related to the rod of Aesculapius, which has only one snake and no wings."
1,"I am 100% satisfied, perfect size, great product quality, was everything I expected from this pendant, well worth the money"
1,I would buy other items from this seller. The only thing is I wish they would mail something this small by USPS and not by UPS and train.
1,"I would never call this awesome ring cheap, but it is a great value!It is one of the lesser quality rings I purchased this time, but it is sturdy, durable, shiny, and exactly what I expected! Couldn't ask for more.Also came super-fast!"
1,"I bought this for my mother-in-law's birthday recently, and she was so surprised when she opened the box, she plotzed right there in the living room. She's OK now, but for some reason I'm not allowed to visit or call for another five months--at least, those were the instructions I think my father-in-law was shouting as my wife hustled me out the door of their house.Anyway, as you can see from the picture above, this tastefully understated pendant makes a great gift. And a versatile one too! See, the folks at Avelor engineered this fine piece of jewelry so that it would appeal to religious Jews (like my mother-in-law) as well as to religious gentiles (like Mel Gibson). And to everyone in between who can't make up their minds. It's kind of like Mounds and Almond Joy all rolled up into one, if you think about it. I did. A lot.I plan on saving up to buy a few more of these pendants before my business trip to Israel in a few months. I think handing these out as gifts to my potential clients will go a long way toward ensuring that my company gets those synagogue-construction contracts. Wish me luck. Shalom!"
1,Bought this for my daughter(15) for Christmas and she loved it....it was very sparkly and although I saw it on(O) another site for less it was still worth it. I love Amazon....I did find a ring to match on the other site as on here i only found one with pink CZ's. So yes...great buy not to be disapointed
1,"This necklace is simply beautiful! Not only do I love the ""key to my heart"" concept, but the quality, too, is very nice. It's definitely shiny / sparkly, but it's not too overwhelming, and the dainty size is perfect for dressy or casual wear. The customer submitted image really doesn't do the necklace justice. I'm very pleased with this purchase. I wear it everyday!"
1,I like this style of ring--not gaudy--just the right amount of bling. Just the right size. It has an antiqueflair.
1,"These are great! They're built well, perfect size, and I just love the look. A modest dash of personnel flair that doubles as a great conversation starter. Shipping was fast too (less than four days) and arrived in a nice little pleather Cuffdaddy box."
1,"I love this ring. It has a great great shape, shine, color and weight. This ring is worth the price."
1,"Great ring, different that the others since it has a squat face. going to wear this one out fast, may need to buy another!"
1,I ordered the ring on a Friday and got it the next Monday.Very fast shipping & the ring looks great.I will be buying from this seller again.Thanks!!
1,"My niece is going to absolutley love this item. she is very ""into""the sun and moon items right now."
1,my grand daughter loves it. she hopes it will bring her good luck for the chinese new years! she is going to wear it for 2013.
1,"Wow, for the money you get a great deal on this beautiful ring. I'm using it as a temp for my wedding wrin as I'm pregnant and my originals do not fit right not now. I'll use it later on my right hand...much too nice to put away. The zirconia is beautifully cut and looks like the real deal. Only draw back is I prefer a band a bit wider than this one other than that it is exceptional. Janeliunas Jewelry, great customer service."
1,THis ring is gorgeous. It is cut just like a diamond so it looks like the real thing. I love how the sterling looks just like old platinum! Its great if you like vintage jewelry.
1,I bought this ring over a year ago and still love it! The quality is excellent and looks very much like an original that my mother owned. I just LOVE it!!!
1,"I had bought this style before, but set with aquamarine, so I knew I was getting a beautiful piece, but seeing it in person surprised even me. I cannot say enough good things about this seller and her jewelry. Great service, prompt responses, and infinite patience with my myriad of questions... All of the rings I have purchased from her have been gorgeous and crafted with obvious pride and attention to detail. I LOVE this ring! I also ordered one of the bands at the same time, which was great because she made sure it was formed to fit together perfectly. You would never guess that they are not an heirloom set passed down through generations."
1,This ring is worh every penny. Looking very good and shines bright. You can't complain anything about it size or color.I love this.
1,With a very limited budget this ring is an excellent choice. The princess cut is brilliant and the setting stands off the ring to make it the focal point.
1,I really enjoyed shopping with this company. I ordered the butterfly braceletBUTTERFLY Filigree Print Pattern Silver Tone PEWTER BRACELETas an stocking stuffer late around December 18th for my daughter-in-law. I did not pay the extra shipping and to my surprise it arrived on the 22nd!!! I appreciate the prompt and excellent service and the product was very nice and sent in a cute little draw string pouch(a nice touch). My daughter-in-law loved the gift. Thank you!
1,I received the jewelry in a timely manner and it was nice for the price.
0,THIS IS THE 2ND ANKLET I HAVE BOUGHT THE 1ST ONE LASTED ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND THE 2ND ONE DIDN'T LAST A DAY. I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO PURCHASE THIS ANKLET EVER. STERLING SILVER CELTIC CLADDAGH CHARM 9 INCH FIGARO ANKLET.
1,"I like this ring, but my daughter really likes it. It has plenty of heft to it, the etchings are deep and well darkened. The fit was perfect, and it even arrived one day earlier than expected. Sadly I have to hide it else I will find it on my daughter's finger."
0,"This ring is heavy and mine needed some additional filing to remove burrs on the inside of the ring. The detailing could be better and the muzzle is too broad, but was worth the price I paid. I wouldn't classify this as a ""werewolf"" - more a classic ""wolf"" or even ""dog"" design. The ring arrived promptly as promised."
0,I was bought this present for valentines day. It's pretty. I do wear them for everyday use
0,I was flabbergasted when I opened the box with these earrings in them. They are so incredibly small in diameter they should only be ordered for a child.
0,They shouldshow actual size somewhere in the add not give you dimensionsthat are in metric so that you can tell what they actually look like' They are extremely small and the picture even though it is of them is blown up to make them look better I may be returning them if my wife doesn't want them as they are small and hard to see. I personally think they are not worth what was charged for them.
1,"They are small, but sparkly and look very cute. My 15 year old loves it, and wears it every day."
1,"For those of us sensitive to nickle (nasty red rash, itching, oozing) this is a God send! Thank-you so much for providing an alternative to painting our jewelry with clear nail polish!(always flakes off anyway!)"
1,"This is a very pretty gift for anyone. I've bought this and everyone in my family liked it very much. The diamonds are really very shiny. In a word, I just love it!!!"
1,The earings were great and not heavy. I gave them to my daughter who need some earings to match a Red Coral necklace. She was excited to get them.
1,"I had purchased this ring shortly before Christmas Eve. I didn't expect it to arrive on time, but it did. Cudos to Silver Insanity for getting it to me on time. My wife absolutely loves it. If you are looking for a Poison Ring for that special someone, and they are into Dragons and such, I would recommend this item.Gothic Dragon and Amethyst Poison Box Sterling Silver Ring Size 8(Sizes 7,8,9,10)"
1,"Well, Silver Insanity does fail to dissappoint. I've ordered from them before and the product and service are both just as great as last time. It arrived quickly, carefully packaged, and the pendent itself is beautiful. Only issue is that it's not Furfur, Its Astaroth, a Prince and the Treasurer of Hell. The pendent though has a very nice shine and great detail. Smaller then I though which is good because I was afraid it might be too big. All in all this piece is one I'll cherish for a long time to come."
1,"I was very pleased with this necklace. It was a little smaller than I expected but actually it's better that way. Other than that, it looks exactly like it's supposed to. It arrived on time and my girlfriend loved it."
0,this necklace is not sterling silver i cant find 925 on it ne where it feels like something that came from a bubble gum machine the key bends easily and will soon just break its more like plastic than silver it was a good fraud for 30 bucks u got me once u will not do it again!!!!!!!!!amanda payne
1,"Wow, I love this pendant. Perfect size. Even though it comes with a strong chain, I did put it on a 14k yellow chain just to hilight the goldtones of the pentagram. Gotten lots of compliments. Comfortable and fun to wear. Quick shipping. Very happy!"
0,"it looks big and strong in a picture but Unfortunately, after few weeks from buying it became broken"
1,"The details on this bracelet are very good. When i first got it I thought it was a bit small but my boyfriend says it fits just fine. Although I wouldnt reccomend this bracelet for any guy with a big wrist as I dont think it will fit and im not sure if you can put an extension on it. Also, one thing that it does not tell you in the description is that on the underside of where the bracelet latches there is a cutout of a heart. I thought that was especially neat."
1,Pendant is beautiful and looks even better in person. Many people have commented on it. The back has a different design than the front--wear it both ways for variety.
0,"This pendant looked horrible when it came in, it appeared to almost have a white powdery look to it- definitely not a shiny silver finish like in the picture. It was no way worth the price and the sellers took over a week to respond back, I returned this item and it took them almost a month to refund my money."
1,"I have ordered these earrings for myself and loved them so much, I wanted to order them as a gift for my friend who loves blue topaz. The earrings came packaged so nicely that I only need to add a card. They are comfortable to wear and look terrific for the summer clothes but also would look great in any season."
0,"I purchased this exact item and was so upset when I received it because it is so tiny. It cannot weigh more than a bottle cap, if that.It is SO very NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!I thought that I could take the rings off and put them on another necklace, but the rings are so minute and little that only the thinnest of chains can fit on it. The chain will break if you unclasp it."
1,This necklace was even more beautiful than the photo. My other mother absolutely loved it. Great quality. Great packaging. Amazon was great as always!
1,This necklace is even nicer than it looks in the picture. Very shiny and eye-catching! For people who have complained about the quality of the chain - I just substituted a higher-end chain that I have from a different necklace and it looks great!
1,"I had wanted these earrings for a very long time to match the necklace,Sterling Silver Sculpted Open Square Pendant, 18"", that I had bought previously. Thankfully I have some wonderful friends that sent them to me for my birthday. The earrings are just as nice and solid as the pendant and worn together the set looks great. I do like that the shape is a bit unusual, people notice it and that's nice too.*I posted a picture of how they look."
1,I would definetly be buying from this person again. The earrings and pendant are beautiful. My friend is sure to like them.
1,"Got this during an additional 60% off sale. What a deal! Very sleek. Looks nicer in real-life than in photo. For the price you get a nice weight chain. You can get the pendant engraved, which I plan to do for a gift. Great buy!"
1,I bought this great necklace for my wife for mothers day some time ago and of all the jewelery I have bought my wife over the past 12 years I feel it has been the best investment.Some have mentioned that the chain is too short but I don't think so. The necklace hangs perfect around my wife's neck. The pendant can be seen with almost any shirt she wears.The chain and pendant have held up fantastic! My wife is a bit rough on jewelery and the thin chain has not broke yet. The pendant and chain have not tarnished at all either.The most important thing about it is that she loves it!!!!
1,very good conditions and exactly in time to gift it to my mother awesome ty!!
1,I sent this to my 68 year old mom for mother's day. She loved it!!!
1,"Once again, another satisfied customer. I brought this for my mother for mother's day and she hasn't stopped wearing it. That's the thing with silver, you can wear it with anything. The price was very reasonable. I would recommend others to buy. Not just for mothers day, but for christmas or a birthday or just because."
1,This neclace was beautiful. My mom loved it and she wares it ALOT now. It was a good value for your buck.
1,Makes a great gift
0,Item was very light weight and not quite what I expected. Made a nice gift anyway.
1,"My husband ""Doc"" bought this for me on a ""Just Because"".The picture does not do this ring justice.It is wonderful. I love feminine jewely with a vintage look and this piece blends in my collection perfectly. The amber is a real eye catcher. I had my jeweler look at it, and his price would have been much higher. The service was quick and the box was gift ready. I will order from Gem Avenue again."
0,"I bought them and they are smaller than they looked. I still have them and have never worn them. They are too small, like they would be for a child. I waited too long to return them, so I'm stuck with them. They are pretty, I might give them to some little girl some day."
1,VERY pretty! VERY dainty!!! GREAT quality for little money! PERFECT for a young girl/pre-teenager which is who I bought them for. VERY satisfied with my purchase!!!
1,"The closeup picture is not doing justice to these because its showing all the wire details, but these are much attractive in person. I bought 4 pairs (one for for my 6 year old daughter)and 3 for gifts. They seem to go with everything. As always, always check the true size instead of depending on the picture. I paid about $10 each."
1,I have bought 4 different Pugster pins (including this pin) and they look fabulous! I gave them as gifts and the recipients were very pleased. The pictures don't do them justice.
1,I love this ring. It came right on time. It is so unique and a great price. Well worth it highly recommended. &lt;3
0,Unfortunately when this item arrived it turned out to be only 3mm gauge bands as opposed to the description which has the bands at 5mm each. I contacted the seller suggesting that they had dispatched the wrong item as they also have listed a 3mm version but they assured me that I had received the correct item and suggested that if I was not happy with it to return it for a refund - which I have done. I find it odd that the seller is unaware of the anomaly in the description and then to assure me the item is correct when it is clearly not as described - go look for yourself!Sterling Silver Russian Wedding 3 Band Ring
1,"My husband and I love this ring! Not only does it symbolize our love, but we dont have to worry about taking off an expensive piece of jewelry every time we wash dishes, or pull weeds! This seller was fantastic. I really really enjoyed this shopping experience!"
1,"Super cute, delicate yet sturdy at the same time. perfect for a child who enjoys running around without the constant worry that it would unfasten and get lost. i had order it too small and it was replaced in time for the holidays. i would say the size is for someone between ages 6 to 8 ( depending on the child size of course.)"
1,"These are gorgeous pearls!!! My Mother in Law to be wanted a pearl necklace for Christmas so I looked in the Department Stores and found beautiful pearls but they were very expensive. I have bought other things from Amazon and was happy but these pearls have surpassed my expectations. I almost don't want to give them to her but I will, I have put these and a black pair on a gift list my Fiance` keeps with him.Thanks Amazon for making my shopping easy."
1,"This bracelet overall is pretty and elegant enough to wear with an evening dress, yet the leather and silver allow it to work with denim (even your most faded jeans), and the classicism of the pearls make it look great with a dress or a suit. It's a lovely combination of tough and classy. Everyone who's seen it loves it, and the pink seems to go with everyones' skin tones. Pink and olive skin doen't always go together, but this particular pink makes olive skin look delicately peach-toned. I'm so glad I took a chance with this unusual design!"
1,"Silver forest earrings are my favorite, and these are no exception. They are good quality and have interesting designs. Each part of the earring moves separately."
1,I was surprised at the quality. The bracelet and necklace matched perfectly. It was a great gift for my 23-year old daughter. She loved them.
0,"I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach..."
1,"The first time that I wore these I got lots of great comments on them. Someone even offered me twice what I paid for them, but I sent them to order them instead."
0,"Although these are really cute earrings, I didn't realize that the emblem was plastic. However, for the price, I can't complain. I still wear them to games!"
1,I love the Dallas Cowboys and like to show it. The earrings are cute and just what I was looking for so there is absolutely nothing I dont like about them. Any females that want to show some spirit for the Dallas Cowboys I would recommend them :)
1,"Since i bought these earrings i have yet to take them off, even if they don't match was i am wearing! I LOVE THEM!"
1,This was a Christmas gift for my sister! She was grateful and surprised. Item was early and in good shape.
1,Being a BIG Bronco fan I was thrilled that my husband gave me these for Christmas. They are much nicer (better quality) then any we had seen.
1,great earrings!! loved them very much! Excellent quality-can't say enough about how nice these are. I would definitely recommend this site. These made great Christmas presents
0,"I ordered earrings and they never arrived. After two weeks, I inquired and was told they would ship them ""again"" ASAP. Another two weeks went by, and still nothing. However, once I requested a refund, that was promptly processed within 48 hours. That's the only thing positive that happened in this experience."
1,"The service was terrific and I have received numerous compliments on these earrings. I wear them every day. I mean, for four bucks, if I lose one I can replace it without feeling guilty about it. I am a very satisfied customer."
1,"I LOVE this thing!! I have a LOT of ear rings (as you can see from my picture), and I always forget what I have in my jewelry armoire. Having them displayed in a nice stand like this one helps a whole lot - and I can display quite a bit of ear rings on this holder! I have several other ear ring holders too, but I must say this one is my favorite one. It's sturdy, it looks great, it's organized, you can hang other non ear ring things at the top (I also hang my random rings and big hoops that wont fit naturally in the other slots).Best.purchase.EVER!"
1,"What an amazing holder for earrings. Well crafted, strong and attractive. This is my pick of the season for great gifts...I love this earring tree."
1,"I love this earring rack! You can arrange your earrings in so many different ways, and it is so easy to find all of them. I love earrings and I don't know how I ever did without it!"
1,really like it. my sister liked it so much that i got her one as a gift.. this saves me a bunch of time that i would spend looking for the correct pair of earrings :)
0,I bought this for a tweenager. It is much larger than I expected. I would like to have seen a little smaller version. construction is OK... Patina appears a bit marginal.
0,"Nice design, but cheaply made. The pieces can come off easily which is fixable I would say with some glue. It's really only a slight inconvenience. I would say it's worth the money if you are willing to put a little effort into it. It definitely holds many earrings and is attractive.I want to specify I am easily to please and have never given a product less than a 4 so that is something to consider when you are looking to buy this item."
1,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR KEEPING UP WITH ALL OF THE SMALL EARRINGS WOMEN COLLECT. NICE LOOKING AND PERFECT FOR THE PRICE.
1,Ours had no flaws in workmanship and seems sturdy. Longer earings will dangle over the holes in the row below but don't really interfere with use.
1,"One of the holes didn't get punched out, but other than that it works just fine. Every row has a different number of holes punched. For me it makes it easier to space my longer earrings. For the price I paid, I am pretty happy with it!"
1,Very beautiful. I bought it for my boyfriend and he wears it every day. Wonderful quality.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and doing some research i found it was $ well spent. It is identical to a Tiffany's necklace going for $250! Great Value!"
1,"Good design and it works fine, does not hang up on clothing or anything else. It's print size is good."
1,"I love this nice heavy ring. It is so cute. I get lots of complaments on it. It fits together well & is comfortable to wear. I recomend it to anyone, even a man could wear this one."
1,My boyfriend bought this necklace for me for valentines day. I fell instantly in love with this necklace. its absolutely adorable. You've got to be CRAZY to not melt over this cute little teddy bear necklace.
1,"Very nice necklace and very pleased that it is the perfect size for my 4 year old. It's a delicate necklace so care must be taken not to break it, but it's a beautiful necklace for a little girl."
1,"Great little earrings. I love little post earrings, and these are delightful and sparkly. Great price...all my silverspeck purchases were steals, GREAT DEALS!!"
1,"These earrings look great! They are well made, and I couldn't ask for a better price."
1,"Prettier in person! This ring was shinier and more expensive looking than the photo featured. It's also delicate looking, with the box/hinge I expected it to be maybe a bit bulky and awkward, but not so. My daughter loves it. Great service from Silver Insanity as well regarding shipping speed/packaging etc."
0,"the ring doesn't look like the same ring from the picture. the black detail in non existent, and the stone is very dull, and has none of the blue hue shown in the picture, mine looks just like glass. i was so excited when i ordered it, but extremely disappointed when it arrived."
1,i gave this to my 10 yr old daughter for valentines day. she loves it and never takes it off. the locket is small but she managed to find two pictures in her photo album of me and her brother and cut out our faces and put them in her locket. too cute
1,"Quality product, great price. My 15-year-old niece LOVED them--birthday gift to her. Her mother (my sister-in-law) loved them due to unusual color & shape. When I saw them later in person I loved them--more attractive even than in pictures. By no means ""too heavy"" as other comments stated, at least not for one 15- and two 55-year-olds. I may get myself & my sister-in-law a different shaped pair in same purple stone for Xmas."
1,"Exactly what it says it will be, and looks as it does on this site. Very happy, my grandmother will love this for her necklace!"
1,"This charm was a gift for my wife, she loved it! The detail is great, it looks like a Golden Retreiver and not some hunk of metal that resembles the shape of a dog. This is the 3rd charm I have bought from this retailer, looks like they believe in quality products. I'll update this review if needed in the future. Looks like it will hold up to the daily rigors living it's life out on a bracelet, I read some reviews where customers were not happy with how sturdy it was made."
0,"I ordered this charm because it looks like a Siamese cat, but the one I received is much less detailed. It still is obviously a cat, but did not match the picture."
1,"I bought this pair of earrings for the game a week before, it was a fast delivery I got them a say before the game! I really like the details in it."
1,I know have 1 very happy sister! These are really nice quality. They came quickly and were not too expensive What more can one ask for?!
1,so beautiful i love it mom yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea 49 jejej
1,Very cute I was suprised because the cost was so low my daughter will love them! I would definately ordered from this company again
0,"Very poorly constructed. The second time I wore this, the metal coil detached from the leather braiding, which promptly began to unravel."
0,The necklace looks great but the end came off as soon as I tried to put it on. Then I noticed the Lobster claw clasp was broke as well. For $2.95 what can you expect?
1,These silver hoops are great! I love them and receive a lot of compliments when I wear them.
0,i have not received this item .i am currently waiting for an answer from an e-mail i sent and have not received that either. I cant rate the product but i can rate the company poor at gettng back to customers !
1,"I bought this bracelet for my wife, and she loved it! Bracelet looks very nice.I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thanks for a nice and affordable jewelry."
0,"I was not happy at all with this product. It does not look at all like the picture. It doesnt sparkle at all (I do not even see any diamonds on it). The clasp does not close all the way, which makes the bracelet fall off.I was not satisfied at all, I would have never paid $50 for it if I saw it at a store. I emailed the company and never recieved a response back. I ended up returning the item, I just hope I do not have issues with them returning my money.Not only that but the delivery of the product took forever. I got it a few days before Christmas. Since it was a gift it would have been nice to get it earlier, but since I didn't I had to run out on Christmas Eve to get that person another gift."
1,I bought this for a friend for Christmas. She loves elephants and sterling silver. She wears it all the time and gets a lot of comments on how cute it is. It's also really neat because you can move the arms and legs. My kids find it fun to play with when she holds them. It's not overly big where it looks bad. I would recommend this if you like elephants or unique gifts. It's certainly one of a kind. :o)
1,"THIS NECKLACE IS A LITTLE SMALLER IN PERSON ,BUT THAT'S OK WITH ME BECAUSE THE SMALLER THE BETTER FOR ME."
1,"However, the white tiger is absolutely beautiful and appears to go on a flat braclet. I have not decided whether to start another braclet or put it on a thin chain for my 6 year old granddaughter. Or I may just convert it into a pin. I was disappointed it was not a pandora bead since it was in that category but it was too beautiful to return."
0,"The item is nice, but a lot smaller and not as nice as it looks in the picture. Not worth the money"
1,This was given to me as a gift. I absolutely LOVE it! I have gotten so many compliments on it! It is a wonderful quality & quite stunning!!
1,"Loved it! Great design, and the size is great, even though I thought it would a smaller. Quick delivery.Suggest it to everybody."
1,"This ring is just beautiful.Very nice quality and elegance for the price.I wear it every day and recieve many compliments,including ""are you engaged""? I'm not,but that should tell you how nice the ring is..And it does feel nice to hear that little compliment.&lt;smiles>"
1,"Since I found Silver Insanity it is the ONLY jewelry company I will buy from. I have purchased celtic necklaces, rings, earrings, charms, and chains and the quality and price CANNOT be beat. I tell everyone I know about this company; STELLER deals and quality. I have never been disappointed, ever, when buying from this wonderful company. Seriously, I am brutal on jewelry but this quality jewerly has never broken...just EXCELLENT, and it arrives practically overnight. I am completely thrilled."
1,"I ordered this for my husband for our annyversary, he likes it a lot and it looks like I spend a ton of money on it! Truth be told...I didn't"
1,I bought this as my husband's wedding band. It is very handsome on him and we both love it.
1,"I bought this for my wife, and she really loves it. It was even more beautiful than the picture gave it credit for. She wears it all the time. Thanks for the great service Netaya!"
0,I ordered this but received something else. Was not happy and will not order from here again.
0,Do not waste your money on buying these bracelets because you'll have to ship them right back. The beads were broken and beat up on a few of the bracelets. The bracelets were aso not tight meaning there was a ton of string and no beads to fill it up. I was shocked even for the price. Horrible quality and I ordered quite a few bracelets.
1,This product arrived well packaged. I am very happy with this bracelet. This bracelet is very beautiful. I am happy with my purchase.
1,This ring is great. I gave it to my grand-daughter. She loved it.
1,"I am happy to say that though I did not receive my order the first time I ordered this cross, the company and Amazon did stand behind their product and refund the money spent on the item. Since they did, I re-ordered the item and it arrived in a timely manner. The cross is really nice. Thank you for the great customer service!"
1,I am very pleased with this cross. It has a substantialsize and weight..and what a great price!!
1,This is the first time I have purchased jewelry from Amazon. Very pretty and very impressive packaging. It also came with a formal appraisal document. Very professional.
0,This ring is beautiful but it is NOT STERLING. It has to be silver plated and not very good plating at that. The plating wore off very quickly to reveal the base metal underneath.
1,"The ankh is perhaps the most widely known Egyptian symbol, representing life, the universe, and immortality. It is symbolic of regeneration. Furthermore, it is theorized that the staff portion is representative of the male principle while the loop is representative of the female principle, thus indicating a union of the two. More particularly, it has been said to be representative of the union between Isis and Osiris, and, as their union would initiate the flooding of the Nile, was called the ""Key of the Nile."" Yet another theory suggests that the loop is representative of the sun rising, while the crossbar represents the horizon and the vertical segment the path of the sun. It is believed to have been associated with a glyph for magical protection, and can thus be interpreted as a good luck talisman. The ankh today has been associated with modern pagan and Wiccan groups.This particular ankh is sterling sliver and is about two inches in length. Though simplistic, it is a great accessory to accompany any wardrobe. It isn't too tacky, too ornate, or too expensive, and silver does tend to go with everything. Make sure you purchase a chain for this as well."
1,Its about the length of my thumb looks exactly like the picture. Ive had it for about 2 weeks and have gotten about 5 compliments on it already. Nice peice I feel good wearing it.
0,Looks cool but its hallow and wears bad. Im afraid it will break easily. Wish it was a solid piece for the price.
1,"I just got the ring, it's very well made and the diamonds are brilliant. It definitely looks like a 3k ring, I am very happy for the price that I paid for."
1,"I purchased this prayer box necklace for my sister in law for Christmas, not only was it packaged perfectly, it was beautiful. The quality was better than I expected and she was very pleased with it."
1,Beautiful silver earrings that exceeded my expectations. The product arrived prompt - I would order from Netaya again. thank you
0,I bought this for my sister-in -law because she loves fairies. When I got it I thought for the price that it was really cute. She had it on for 10 minutes and the fairy broke off of the bracelet. It was very poorly made and I was very unhappy with it.
1,1.50 Carats Trillion Cut Genuine Garnet Sterling Silver Pendant NecklaceMore beautiful in person than pictured. Fast shipment.
0,"Look, highly impure titanium should be as hard or harder than glass. Commercial grade titanium should be slightly below diamond hardness. The hardness of this grade of titanium is that of about mild steel. I don't know what they mixed this titanium with, but it scratches very easily. I wanted a ring that would be hard and resist scratching. This thing scratches MUCH easier than my 18k white gold wedding ring. How this could possibly be actual titanium, I don't know. Frankly, for the price I paid, its not worth the hassle of sending it back, but I would recommend not buying this ring. I consider the cost of this ring a learning experience for me. Don't trust something just because it says ""Titanium"" on it. Find out what the hardness of the ring is before you buy it.The hardness of metals surfaces in the arbitrary MOHS scale (1 = hardness of Talc surface; 10 = hardness of Diamond surface) are, in increasing order"
1,This ring was very light weight and was comfortable to wear due to the comfort fit design. The quality was equal to those rings that are far more expensive. This ring is perfect for someone who is looking for light weight and comfort at a very affordable price. Don't let the price fool you. This ring is of very good quality for the price.
1,Received the ring within 7 days from ordering. Quality and service are both high quality.
1,"I BOUGHT THIS TO WEAR WITH A LAPIZ BRACELET AND THEY LOOK SO GOOD TOGETHER,ALSO WEAR IT WITH MY WHITE PEARL BRACELET,SO ,LISTEN UP LADIES,THIS IS A NICE BLUE(HARD TOO FIND BLUE)GRAB IT FAST ,AT THIS PRICE IT WONT LAST."
1,"Bought this for my daughter's birthday, couldn't have been happier with the item, just what we were looking for. Just as described/pictured, extremely fast shipping. Highly recommend this vendor."
0,This charm has a Winnie The Pooh and I like him so he gets one star there. The color is preety good so one more star. They covered most of the charm so you don't see the metal as much one more star.3 stars
1,"Arrived as predicted, impressive items, have received a lot of compliments. Will order again!"
1,"Really a bit stunned with these earrings. They are more beautiful than pictured and very expensive-looking. Nothing chintzy here. Great buy for the money. Elegant style and true color. Strong leverbacks. And Gem Avenue is a great seller. Thanks again, Gem Avenue."
0,I sent this as a gift but they did not included note. So the recipient did not know it was from me!
1,Great quality and nice size earrings.i am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone interested.
1,"I bought these for my lovely wife and she adores them. Nice blue color, nice sparkle. Well constructed. Worth every penny."
1,i wear them all the time very nice good color goes with everything i will buy more in the future from themthank you ruthi
1,I got these as a Christmas gift for a friend. This is a very nice buy. They are very pretty and dainty looking. They are light to wear. The blue pearl and the tiny crystals make a very looking nice gift. They are inexpensive but do not look inexpensive.
1,"bought pendant to replace one purchased in malaysia, my wife is absolutely delighted with the pendant from golden dragon"
1,All I need to say is that the wife loved it and wears it regularly.
0,"This ring had such great ratings, after visiting it often, I finally bought it as a gift. When I saw it in person, I was not impressed. It does look like the picture, but it also looks cheap. I do realize it costs cheap, I just wasn't impressed. It did arrive VERY quickly though."
1,It fits perfect on my thumb finger which is what i was looking for. Also fits good on my index finger as well. Thanks
1,i love this ring it looks just like the picture and has not left my finger since i got it. the fit is perfect and i got it in good time.
1,"I got two of this ring for two of my sisters whos birthdays are in December. I also purchased one with an amethyst, one with a sapphire and one with a peridot. Now my mother, my three sisters, and I can have matching birthstone rings. They are attractive and simple enough to be worn to work every day."
1,"I happen to be wearing this ring right now!! lol it came in on time and it was going to be a gift for my sister but she said she thought it would look good on me ( and she liked the other ring i got her too) Great gift to give, its a beautiful blue and great design!"
1,"I didn't realize how picky my taste is with rings until I scoured Amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me. This ring is one of the few I found, and I am far from a fan of having stones in my rings. It has a nice low profile. I've yet to have it catch on anything. I'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings, but this again managed to sidestep that distaste. The stone has no backing, so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle, tinted by my finger."
1,"The ring setting is very lovely but you can tell that the stoneisn't real at a glance. But I still love the color! The blueis so soft and beautiful. It kinda reminds me of the sky.Except that the color is a bit lighter. Still, the ring is lovely. Too big, but still.... Love it!!!"
1,I love my celtic knot ring from Silver Insanity. I've loved everything I've ordered from this company and will certainly order from them again.
1,"I received the ring today, Feb 12, after placing the order on Feb 8 - fast delivery! The stone is a very pretty clear light blue, and while the metalwork has some flaws, you can't tell unless you're really examining it. For the price, this ring is perfect! Just what I was looking for, fits great, and looks great!"
1,Just what I wanted and arrived in very quick time and it was loved asa present. Also it was packaged in protective fashion
1,"I love this ring--I never take it off. It's beautiful, and fits like a charm. Great buy!"
1,"This pendant is lovely! If you happen to be a flower lover (my #1 theme in the jewelry I buy with hearts coming in second) you will want to add this to your collection. The chain is sturdy enough and the price is very reasonable. Needless to say, I am very happy with this purchase."
1,I love this necklace and I have received several compliments on it! I can't add any more to this review.
1,"these are very pretty and look beautiful on. I love them, except that they do tarnish! But they are easy to clean !"
0,The necklace was too long and the beading around the pendant was crooked.
0,"I ordered this on a whim and was very disappointed when it arrived. It's very cheap-looking and the clasp broke the first time I put the necklace on. I tried fixing the clasp, and then the chain broke.Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk."
1,This item was bought as a gift and i am very impressed with it. The quality of the product exceeded its price tag. It has been worn for about 3 weeks now and i haven't noticed any scratches so far. This is a really good buy.
0,"First off, it's a light blue or light turquoise stone, not a bright blue stone like in the picture so I was kind of disappointed. Pretty, but not what you see in the image. Secondly, there is very little color contrast between the gold-toned side pieces and the rest of the ring in silver. Being that the ring is much smaller than what you see in the picture, the gold really doesn't show up much. So in essence, it looks like a silver ring, not two-tone.That being said, it's a nice ring. Well-made and pretty and true to size. I have been wearing it fairly often."
1,Beautiful bracelet at a great price. Second purchase from amazon.com jewelry. Will never buy at a jewelry store again!
1,"I love this ankle bracelet! I don't even realize that I'm wearing it, it's so lightweight, but very sturdy! It's a pretty delft blue color, and neutral enough to go with any fashion. Don't hesitate with this one!!"
1,"This is lovely, it is simple yet pretty. Surprisingly strong. I've had it for a month or two with no problems (no the blue of the faux pearls hasn't chipped off at all).It is a versatile item, a simple change from casual lounging around to a discreet addition to a more professional setting. One other plus is that unlike many other anklets with charms constantly hitting against your ankle or with sharp crystals digging into it, you hardly notice it's there.I would recommend it. It's worth the price."
1,This ring is beautiful. I returned it because it is too big/wide for my finger but the diamonds are an EXCELLENT quality. This ring is worth every penny.
1,"This jewelry cleaner is GREAT! You only need to use water, and in three minutes time everything comes out sparkling just like it has been professionally cleaned. It is well worth the price."
0,"I like this jewelry cleaner very much, although nothing in the description said you must use a jewelry cleaning fluid. In fact, it said it could be used with nothing but water. The directions that came with it did not mention that, and supplied a bottle of cleaner. I am rather disappointed about that.Mireille McKell"
0,"This is an inexpensive, good looking, and efficient enough cleaner, but may have very limited life due to faulty components. I've purchased three of these, and know now it was a poor investment. The first stopped working after 5 months, and thinking it just bad luck, bought two more; one, I gave as a gift and reportedly is still working, but the second stopped working for me after almost a year of regular use. It works well, but you'll take your chances with this unit."
0,Unfortunately a waste of money. Didn't really clean the pieces that needed to be cleaned. Just shined up the ones that were already cleaned. Polish cloths worked 100% better.
1,"It cleans real good. You can clean anything that will fit in it, eye glasses, bracelet, & earrings. It's a little pricey."
0,This is a small cleaner which does the trick for gold and gems. Not powerful enough to remove tarnish from silver even with jewelery cleaner. Would have spend a little more to buy an American made product.
0,"It does an OK job of cleaning, but the power button stops working after a while (used once a day for a few months).I bought another because they were cheap (on sale at harbor freight). The 2nd one just died even faster than the first.It's just the power button. The mechanics are fine."
0,A nice compact unit that seems to work okay. The major drawback in my book is the 3 minute timer that is about 2 minutes in duration. It would have been better served if it had a consumer controlled timing.
0,"Good tool to use for regular cleaning maintenance. Certain things like copper jewelry or eye glasses will still need extra cleaning so if you're looking for something that does a real thorough job this may not be the item for you. Otherwise the sky is the limit. I dont regret buying the item, but I knew not to have high expectations for the price I paid by comparison to other cleaners."
1,I was very pleased when I saw these cufflinks...very nice looking & feel quite substantial. Got them for a gift & recipient was very pleased with them. Highly recommend this item
1,I absolutely love this cuff. You can open it wider so it can fit easily to your ear. I've been using it daily and I haven't had problems with losing any of the set I got. It's a good buy.
0,"I only recieved one of the two cuffs I had purchased. I love the cuff that I purchased and use it, i was just very disapointed when i only recieved one."
1,"These look very cute, versatile, and simple. They bend easily. The teeny tiny size is perfect for my small ears. The detailing is lovely. These are easy to put on and take off. They are so comfortable that today I thought they fell out because I couldn't feel them all day long. I wore these to sleep once and they didn't fall off. They stay on firm, but not painfully tight. Great price. These are a must-have!"
1,"I can no longer wear pierced earrings due to an allergic reaction to the metal. However, I seem to be able to wear metal as bracelets & rings, so I thought I would try some ear cuffs to see if they would work - I really miss not being able to wear earrings! These are just adorable!! They are flexible enough that I can open a bit to fit where I want, and then give a little squeeze to tighten so they don't fall off. Shipping was fast, too. Very pleased with my purchase."
1,MY DAUGHTER LOVES ALL NEW AND DIFFERENT ACCESSORIES AND THIS MAKE HER OUTFIT REALLY STAND UP AND SCREAM OUT LOUD
1,I bought this ring for my 88 yr. old mother for Christmas. It is a lovely ring and the fit is true to size. She really likes it too. The red stone is a deep red. I am hoping that since it is gold over silver that it will not tarnish. Nice ring!
1,Bought these for my wife as just a little suprise and she's very happy with them. The quality was great and the arrived quickly. No complaints.
0,"I bought these for my girlfriend and within a week of her wearing it twice the ""silver"" started flaking off the earrings. This is probably the worst quality earrings on amazon. You can get much better quality for lesser price. I am quite disappointed."
1,This item is to be a Christmas gift for my daughter and I am certain that she will love these earrings as much as I appreciate their quality!
1,"I like them a lot, beautiful light-blue stones. They didn't look quite as delicate as I thought they were when I ordered them but looking at the image now I can see where I got my misconception. The white reflection on the white background you can kind of miss some of the details. But very beautiful. I am very happy."
0,"This product looks great, and when you open it, it seems great. But it isn't at all. I should have listened to everyone else. The ends where the balls screwed on were so mis-shapen and sharp, that it cut my belly ring hole when I tried to put it in. I tried cutting it, but that didn't do anything either. Now I have to wait for it to heal. Do not waste your money."
0,"I loved having my belly button pierced before I was pregnant, and while I was pregnant, I kept my belly button ring in. When it started getting uncomfortable for me, I bought this ring. The balls fell off a lot and it was a little bit too long. In the end, I never put my belly button ring back in, so I should have just taken it out all together while I was pregnant."
1,"I love this ring! Its prettier in person than in the picture. The style is very flattering on the hand, I think it is now my favorite ring. If your looking for an attractive, fun ring to wear, this would be it!"
0,"The color and quality of the jade is not as pretty as in the photo, also not polished well. I'm kind of disappointed."
1,"These earrings are fun to wear. They are my spring, summer earrings. They are pretty and breezy to wear!"
1,"My grandson picked out this ring for me, because he knows I love pink,it's a good fit, very pretty and fun to wear."
0,"The ring is fake. I haven't even had this for half a year, and the ""gold"" has faded on the sides. Oh, and it doesn't even look real."
1,"These are really nice to polishing silver jewelry. They work well and it's nice to have a couple of back-ups for the tough jobs. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are impregnated with a cleaning agent, so they can't be washed. But, even if they appear black from removing tarnish from jewelry, they still work."
1,"SO AWESOME. wow. i had a bunch of silver jewellery i never wore because it was so dirty and icky and EW but once i polished them with one of the trios, , they looked great. i even used it on some cheap-o but still very cute necklace i got an accessory store (non-silver) and it even cleaned that too! incredible. definitely buy, it's also a much better price than those other ones because you get three and they're about the size of a kleenex or maybe a little bigger."
1,"Stunning band, heavy and solid. True to size. If you like a ring that shines, this is one of the best."
1,"Ordered the butterfly ring...thought it was unique and when it arrived I was very pleasednot only with the look of it, but the quality too. Very good for the price."
1,I GOT THIS RING FOR MY SISTERS BIRTHDAY! She loves it! Its small and pretty just like her and its a great price for this ring! I LOVE AMAZON !
1,"Butterfly 14k Gold-Plated RingIt is just a must for ladies who love Butterflies... very nicely done..... even came with with free bracelet..I was surprised by it's craftsmanship , I did not expected such solid ring, it makes real nice and looks perfect on the finger, too bad I got wrong size.. maybe get 1 number up make sure to fit, it is solid material. I love it !!!"
1,"Good product, very well priced, was well packeged, and it shipped here to LA in amazing time, thank you !!"
1,I recieved my order in a fast matter an was very pleased. I will be ording again soon. Thank You
1,Vibrant colors have stayed vibrant after several washes. The throw is true to size and is well made. Have had it about a month now.
1,My mom absolutly loved them and they fitted against her ear perfectly and they arrived on time as amazon always does.
1,"I lost one of the earrings so i purchased another set. I have 4 piercings on my ear and these look elegant, can be worn as zircon or gold studs, and have remained securely on my ear for 3 years now."
1,The item was as advertised both in size and quality. I am very pleased.These small pearl earrings are difficult to find.
0,"The ring is nothing like the picture. Too light, not as smooth, not as beautiful."
1,"I absolutely loved the ring I received as a gift so I went to their site and ordered several items from Silver Speck as gifts for my friends who are also August birthdays, hence the Peridot.Silver Speck offers high-quality jewelry a very low prices and has tremendous customer service. When I had a slight problem with an order, Silver Speck did not hesitate a second to rectify the problem and I am totally pleased with their products and their customer service. I highly recommend this vendor and this item.Sherri"
1,"Bought these as a gift for someone special... He like them, so I was happy! Good for the price! Thanks!"
0,This bead is cute but the silver coloring came off around the stones almost immediately. I have only had for 4 days.
1,Meticulous and beautiful workmanship. Gorgeous use of all natural semi-precious stones. Made in the American Southwest! Never disappointed with this designer.
1,Necklace arrived extremely quickly. The workmanship is excellent and it is more beautiful than shown on the site.The company promotes fair trade and came with a tag telling who made the necklace and a bit about the artist.Highly recommended.
0,I loved this piece until the clover face came unglued. Now it's a locket with a bunch of glue on the face. Sigh.
0,"a friend of mine gave one of these to me randomly after a road trip. to be quite honest, I thought it was a gas station souvenir, because it was so cheaply made, but I loved it! it's tiny, delicate and adorable...and sitting in my car in a cup holder since the chain broke after wearing it for 2 days."
1,"I really like this little locket. I read the reviews ahead of time, so I immediately moved it to a different chain. Haven't had the chain breaking issue. :) It is VERY VERY small, though. Small enough that I don't know if you could actually even fit the ashes of a four-leaf clover in the compartment. :P Two of these would make cute earrings. ;)"
0,"I had this item on my wish list and was very excited when someone purchased it for me, however after wearing it for a few short hours I found that this was not something to be happy about. I am very sensitive to metals but since this was sterling silver I thought that it would be ok, however I broke out in a really awful rash and now have a necklace that I can no longer wear. So basically BUYER BEWARE! Don't make the mistake I made and end up like me!"
1,Bought this ring for my girlfriend and she loves it! The size was right on and the flex style of the ring made it very comfortable to wear. Great buy!
1,This Omega necklace is the perfect size and gauge for fused glass pendants. I am ordering several more. Thanks!
1,I put the cross on it and good to go
0,"I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does. I'm returning it."
1,The Italian Sterling Silver Omega Chain Necklace looked a bit dainty but it is not! It is strong and beautiful. Looks great with or without a pendant. I love it! Excellent for summer because it is not too heavy.Thanks for a great product.
1,I had ordered a pendant to wear to a family wedding and needed a chain. This Omega was the perfect answer. This item is well worth the money.
0,"This is NOT a chain necklace. If you buy this product you will get an 18"" long, 1.26 mm diameter tube with tiny notches along its surface. The ""strong lobster clasp"" looks like it's made of cheap plastic."
1,"I ordered two of these 1 MM Omega chains to go with gift pendants and, they were everything I was hoping for. Strong, shiney, secure lobster clasp, and able to give some extra ""lift"" to show off the pendant. I ordered thin Omegas such as these so that I could slide the pendants on easily. I am using one of them myself with a large, simple gemstone that I wish to showcase. Advice"
1,"This is a very nice, detailed 3D charm. Note that the product description says the charm moves - that's true, but only the double levers. The helix, turn handle, and other ""parts"" don't, as on a working corkscrew."
1,"I really like the necklace. It is a small globe and hangs great with a V-neck or scoop neck shirt. The &#34;gold&#34; isn't super high quality, but it is nice and matches the earrings perfectly. It's a fun set especially for anyone who likes travel, globes, etc. I love it!"
0,"The outer cover of the music box is glossy and very appealing, but the ballerina inside is not durable, and pieces of her fell off in a few months. The music plays nicely, though. Based on the overall quality of this item, the appropriate price range would be from $10-15, no more."
1,This was just what I was looking for and my daughter loves it! It came within the promised time and looks nicer than the picture.
0,"I got this as a Christmas present for my niece. When I received it in the mail. I opened up the package and the whole topjust came off. It is the worst, cheapest looking jewerly box I have ever brought and I am sure to never buy from this seller again!!!"
0,"Simply put, this jewelry box is so cheaply made it's not even worth the low price. It's too bad, because the paper overlay is one of the prettiest I've seen out there, but I would caution anyone considering this to look elsewhere. I gave it to my 4 year old for her birthday and the ballerina broke within days. Also after a week or so of opening and closing the hinges on the back came loose and eventually disengaged from the box. Very disappointing."
0,"held up ok to my 3 yr old, nothing lasts forever I guess. Cute little ballerina that will get lost in a matter of time."
1,"I'm not sure how to adequately describe the color of the mural on the sides and the top. I'd say a watercolor-like mixture of bronze, purple, and a pink. It's very pretty. The ballerina on the outside is a brunette (looks like early 20s) so that's a nice change. The twirling one inside is blond like in the other models.I like the music it plays, and it is very lightweight.The only problems I noticed were slight rippling of the (adhesive'd) cover and tiny dents when I got it. I'm not sure if this is common. My niece probably won't notice it."
1,My granddaughter loved it. She's 8. I picked this rating because no other thing could have been better. She played the music all morning.
0,I couldnt wait to get the nose bone. But it kept falling out! I would awake and find it on the pillow next to me. also it wasn't long enuf. I lost it inside of two weeks. I bought a cheap silver set of them for 12.00. They went all the way through and I havent had any trouble with losing them. I will not buy a nose bone from Amazon again and it's a shame because I always get stuff from Amazon! I am SO sorry I spent $60.00 on it
1,I bought this as a Christmas present for my young daughter. The armoire is exactly as described. It is easy to assemble (just screw in the legs and hinged top) and even came with a kit to screw it into the wall to prevent it tipping over. It's gorgeous and reasonably priced and arrived in perfect condition.
1,Very easy to put together and looks better than picture. Roses look pink but they are more of a plum color. Good price for such a beautiful piece of furniture. My Granddaughter will love it.
0,"I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers. I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers. When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments, the drawer just falls out. If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely. Very cheap workmanship. Not worth it. If you are a prospective buyer, I'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models."
1,"AMAZING!!!!This jewelry box was even better than I ever imagined. I would buy from this company again. Actually, I need one more for my other daughter. Don't hestitate, it is perfect."
1,"I'm very happy with this purchase. It was down to two jewelry armoires and I chose this one for the price, it was $150 less than the other one. Well, am I glad I chose this one. I'm so happy with it. Not only was it packed securely but it was easy to assemble and all the legs were even when stood upright. I love the mauve, velvety lining since my eyes are not what they used to be and the other armoire had black lining, I prefer the mauve. It matches my decor beautifully since my bedroom has a lot of vintage mauve and is country victorian. Also, it's sturdy and quite heavy. I love it, can't wait to fill it with all my treasures."
1,The antiqued finish gives it a heirloom like look. I have since purchased 'OurLady of Guadelupe' medallion for my wife.
0,The ring is beautiful but not true to size. I wear size ten but 1/2 size larger would have been more comfortable in this design.
1,I love the ring- I get a lot of compliments on it!
0,"When I received this ring, it appeared to be very lightweight and cheap. Within two weeks one of the side stones fell out. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,A cool piece or memorabilia. A little plastic feeling but not bad for the price. Can't really find anything else like it. Goes great with the rest of our POTC stuff.
0,"I bought this for my 20 year old daughter. The balls won't stay on the ends, she is constantly losing them. It does glow in the dark, though very dimly. She is not very happy with it."
0,"Ive noticed in the other reviews people commenting on how it looks and yes, it is beautiful in person. However, the bar is too long so it does not fit correctly. The top jewel will not lay flat against the skin because the bar is too long and it allows the top jewel to stick out. Idk, very pretty but not wearable. So it's useless"
1,This Celtic Birth Charm is great. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't taken it off since. I looks better in person.
1,"On time, nice packing in a cute velvet bag. Charm comes with a small book on Celtic birth signs. This birth charm is adorable!Has nice antique look to it. I wear it all the time with a black silk cord chain that I purchased with the charm. It is eye catching - people always ask me what is it."
0,This was a very pretty charm until the antiqueing wore off. Now it's a ulgy charm................Not for everyday wear.
0,"The metal portions of the earrings are a very cheap-looking yellow, not at all like the photograph. I bought them for a present, and had to buy something else."
0,"The crystals are lovely and sparkle a great deal. I purchased 2 and one of them has the alternating stones wrong. It's not bad and not worth returning, I just wear that part of the ring toward my palm. But for what you pay, it's a great ring!"
1,This is very nice well made ive gotten many comments from friends and family about it will be sure to take good care of this
1,This piece of jewelry was a very good choice. I must say so myself. It was beautiful when I took out of the bag. Even more appealing when I put it on my toe.
0,"I loved the color and design of this belly ring. However, I found that the actual ring looked REALLY large in my piercing. My navel piercing isn't very deep, but it also isn't too thin. I believe I wasted my money on something I'll never use."
1,"This ring is very beautiful and I loved it. The setting was perfect and had the look and feel of a true diamond ring even though it was cubic zirconia. The return instructions were excellent as I needed to return item due to size. If this product was available I would reorder immediately. I had an opportunity to speak to the company on the phone and they were extremely helpful, courteous and accommodating even though I was returning the product. I would recommend using this company and look forward to doing business with them again."
1,"This piece of jewerly was worth every penny & then some. I had my jeweler put a bigger jump ring on it so it would fit on the chain I never take off. I expected the blue jewel to fall out in the gym, shower, or at some point since it's 1 of 5 pendants that I always have on. But shockingly it hasn't! The seller was completely honest in the description & they were very prompt in shipping."
0,"cheap quality.. I don't recommend it. The spinning section wiggles and you grow tired of it, about 2 minutes after wearing it"
1,The ring was exactly as it was pictured. The size fit well and delivery was quick.Thanks!
1,"For the price, these earrings are so pretty. My daughter loves them. She is five years old. The price of the earrings makes it very easy for me to replace them if she ever loses one. I would definitely purchase another set from the company even if they are different in style and color."
1,I ordered the Aquamarine ring for my daughter for Christmas. It is beautiful. She wears this ring every day and treasures it. I plan on ordering another Aquamarine ring in a different style for her birthday.
0,Item was never received despite the several excuses and promises. A refund was issued by Amazon
0,I like the ring but it is not the best. the stone was a pretty blue but not aquamarine. looked more like a very dull blue topaz. the ring was not a true size five ring. it came at a 5 1/2. and please don't try to wear this ring everyday. keep in box and wear at special occassions. i wore it for three days straight and that third day the prongs holding the gemstone in place were all bent up. pretty ring though.
1,"THIS IS A VERY NICE RING, THE STONE HAS A BEAUTIFULL COLOR AND THE CZ SHINES A LOT!!!!!"
1,i love the ring its the first birthstone ring i have ever had it fits great and goes with all my outfits.
0,I got this to try out this style bellyring and I didn't like it at all. This looks very cheap.
0,"The belly ring was very cute and looked great, but it was poorly made and broke within a few days."
0,Charm is very thin and flimsy - feels like something you'd get at a dollar store- design doesn't show up accurately in photos - I won't order from this company again - low quality - too bad because the celtic birth charm idea is interesting -
1,"This was a very inexpensive piece of jewelry. I was a little worried as to how ""cheap"" it might look. But when it came I was very impressed. I have received many compliments on it. I like it so much that I ordered a few more to give away as presents!"
1,I got this sterling silver locket for my 12 year daughter for Christmas and she loved it.She had a tiny little photo of her baby cousin (that was taken from far away)and it fit perfectly. She just glued it in with regular school glue and it turned out perfect!She often wears the locket with another little pendant on the same chain.I was surprized at how cheap it was because it was sterling silver.
0,"Make sure you review the clarity and grading scale before you purchase jewlery on line without seeing the piece first.This is clearly stated as a I2 - I3 clarity grade which is defined as containing large inclusions that are visible to the naked untrained eye.The grading is correct, my wife instantly notice a large black flaw in the diamond. You get what you pay for."
1,"The picture of this ring does not do it justice, It is beautiful and has already mistaken for a much more expensive look alike I buy from them a lot and am always pleased!!!!"
0,The ring is ok. The one i recieved was pretty dull. The stone was cloudy and looked like plastic. Everything about the ring is nice except the stone. The lavender has a much better stone so i would suggest buying that one instead.
1,I bought this for my girlfriend based on the other Amazon reviews and was not disappointed. It is a beautiful ring and she absolutely *loved* it.
1,This is a very nice ring for the money. The stone is larger than I thought but it is not gaudy. I am very happy with this purchase. It was a birthday present to myself..very pleased!
1,I needed a plain gold band for when I travelled to areas that my wedding set was inappropriate to wear! This band was perfect and exactly up to the standards I would expect from Amazon.
1,"I gave this ring 5 stars because it is, in fact, a ring. And I'm still married after five years, so, ya know, that's great, too."
1,"It was a pleasure doing business with you. Not only did I get exactly what I wanted (and you displayed), but I got it in the time frame promised - with plenty of time for Christmas.I will definitely be doing business with you again."
0,"Unfortunatly, this ring only lasted me about a month before it was cracked in two by gripping something to hard while I was wearing it... I have always been attraced to hematite and the product is of good quality, but must be treated delicatly or you will snap it half..."
1,"this ring is not only cute, it reallys helps with pain that I get with my many hours of keyborad work, due to my job."
1,"I love this ring. It's really nice for work, adds to your hands without being flashy or gaudy. It's not heavy, it's really great."
0,"If your special someone has big wrists, this will probably make them very happy. But if they have normal, lady-sized wrists..."
1,"I was extremely impressed with this ring. It has great fire, great shine, great polish, and is .15 carats larger than what I ordered. This was my first major purchase on Amazon and I was hesitant about spending that much money but it was definately worth it. Probably the best purchase I've ever made. The IGI certificate that came with it valued the entire piece at about 5x what I payed. Talk about a deal! A hometown independant jeweler also confirmed the appraisal. I almost feel guilty about paying so little for the ring (almost.) Great job Amazon, I can't wait to see the look on my girlfriend's face when she sees this ring!"
1,Beautiful Cameo direct from Italy - My wife is VERY happy with the gift as well as I and it's superb presentation. I would order from them again.
1,Kind of looks like an estate piece of jewelry. Lots of sparkle and pretty detailing. Shipped out fast and packaged really nicely. A great bracelet for the price. So happy with this purchase and have always had a good shoppingmexperience with this seller. Definitely would recommend you buy from them :)
1,"My mother passed away from Ovarian cancer in 2006, and when she was in hospice, I made about 12 bracelets for family members...using a mixture of teal beads, and silver awareness ribbons and such. I still have the bracelet I made myself then, but when I saw the display for this bracelet at the drugstore with the Loreal products, I got on and ordered it right away. It's nice to have something with me everyday to remind me of my mom, but it is still subtle and elegant. I have received many complements on it as well. Eventually, I think I will get the matching necklace and earrings."
1,A very dear friend and many acquaintances have passed from this dreadful disease. I ordered this bracelet in honor of their brave fight against this insidious monstor. The bracelet is absolutely beautiful as a gift for your family or friends - or for yourself.
1,This is a very pretty bracelet. Actually nicer than expected. It is exactly as pictured. Fits great. A little hard to get on because it fits pretty tight. I put it on and left it on since it's sterling silver it wont turn color and I've been wearing it 24/7 for over a month now and it's still shiny and gorgeous. I get lots of compliments. The picture actually doesn't do the piece justice. And the price? What a deal!!!
1,"absolutely beautiful, more beautiful in person, shiny cat eye beadsSuch an incredible price, I will do business with this Co. again"
1,I got this pendant for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. It's the perfect size and it looks great. The chain is a box link and its really pretty. I'll definitely buy more jewelry from Sabrina Silver.
1,I got this bracelet for a gift for a friend who has breast cancer. It is absolutely beautiful. It even came it a pink box that I thought was adorable too. I was definitely pleased with my purchase.
1,"Huge fan of fleur de lis and the pendant was perfect except it bothered me that it hangs upside down compared to the earrings I bought to go with it. This could be just an OCD problem of mine, but I wear it almost all the time and it looks great and I get a lot of positive feedback from people who see me wear it. I would recommend it to anyone who is a lover of fleur de lis history or not because it is a nice piece of silver jewelry and you can wear it at any length just by putting it on a longer or shorter chain."
0,The quality of this ring is horrible. The ring is made of some sort of plastic material and the onyx stone looks fake and horrible. This ring is not worth more than a dollar.
1,"I was astonished when I received this ring. The shine, the fit, the color, everything was perfect. I was a little hesitate about buying a ring off of the internet but decided to give it a try and boy am I glad. I had looked in stores and the prices for one this nice were 2 to 3 times what I paid. Even the department store type rings were more expensive and the feel of the ring on the finger was very rough compared to the nice comfortable feel of this ring. The shipping I chose was 2 day but I received it 24 hrs. after I ordered online. It is definitely worth more than 5 stars. Thanks for a beautiful ring!!"
1,"Eves Addiction is Awesome! They shipped this necklace out so quickly, I got e-mails when the order was recieved and when it shipped out (the same day the order was placed). The crown necklace is GORGEOUS, even prettier in person, I love it! I must add that another seller is selling this item for $20 more with almost double the shipping cost. I am sooooooooo Happy I chose EvesAddction their service was perfect and the necklace is perfect! I highly recomend them and their jewelery."
1,But I have learned to love tiger eye because of this bracelet. Very energizing and soothing at the same time. I wish they had the same necklace.
1,"i don't care what any of the other reviews said. this bracelet is BEAUTIFUL!! i bought this for my friend and it really is VERY identical to the picture displayed. The actual color of stones look exactly like the picture. They're not darker at all. That's what i was mainly concerned about before i got it..but it looks PERFECT! haha When u first look at it..in real life..u'll be stunned :D This bracelet is a VERYYYY NICE buy, plus shipping was pretty fast too!"
1,"Very pretty and sparkly. I received many compliments the first time I wore it. The pink stones are darker than the picture. About 7 1/4"" in length, 1/4"" wide. I also have it in black,Sterling Silver Black Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet, and red,Sterling Silver Red Sqaure and Simulated Diamond CZ Circle Bracelet."
0,"When I got this, I loved it. The orange bead really grabbed my eye and I wore it with everything. But it so flimsy. It broke after wearing it twice. I was really disappointed. Normally I dont have a problem with NVIE but this time it was a bummer."
1,"This is not a RICH pendant, this character means HAPPINESS AND LUCK. When hang upside down, it means HAPPINESS AND LUCK ARRIVE. What a disappointment, since I got it for my niece for her birthday."
0,"Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe."
0,"I bought three of these- one for myself, one for each of my daughters - and ALL of them broke within 1 week.TERRIBLY MADE PRODUCT.Very pretty, very disappointing."
0,"In the photo, these earrings did indeed look ""cute"" and ""small,"" as described. They are, in reality, chunky and about the size of a nickel...VERY hard to tell this from the picture. These earrings would be perfect with a bright yellow 80's power suit. Otherwise, steer clear!"
1,This pendant is very pretty and I've received lots of complements. It's unusual and unique and very well done.
1,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday. It's of really good quality and she loves it, and I would recommend to anyone."
1,Very nice. I wear it all the time with other bracelets it works well with my other braceletsPrice was right too.
0,its cute..but too small...and way too expensive for the price.I ordered it for my mom's birthday and had to buy something else for her and keep this for myself.
1,I loved the fine details . Very good work.The Falling dove this product is shoule have had some history with it. Altough it was a very nice charm
1,"I ordered this Claddagh Ring for my boyfriend and I's 6 month anniversary. The ring came quickly with great shipping, perfect condition and even in an adorable little gift box along with a box for the ring itself. My boyfriend absolutely loves it and it was nice to find a ring that I could give to him. It's very hard to find a good promise ring for a male and this is the best one for the best price that I have found anywhere."
1,This ring is a terrific buy. I got more compliments on this ring than any other I purchased from any other seller. Absolutely satisfied!!!!!!!!
0,Got 7 CN Tower charms for a ladies group. The quality of the silver charms is not what I expected. They seem rather inferior in quality. No time to make a return on the product so just have to live with my purchase.
0,"I ordered this pendant to match some earings I ordered at the same time. Yes they match, but the hues are not as shown. The back of the pendant and earings have a golden finish and they gleam gold. I wanted the tradition Swarovski with all the various hues. Sending these back."
1,"I thought it would be a little bigger, but that does not take away it's beauty. I really recommend it."
1,This pendant along with the Swarovski earrings I had bought recently are sooo beautiful!I wore them together to work and everyone wanted to know where I bought them.They couldn't believe the price as well!These were BLING to the max and I would rather wear Swarovski products than diamonds as I get more feedback!Thank you so much for allowing me to buy something so beautiful for such an inexpensive price.
1,"The pendant is a perfect match for the earrings I got for a friend of mine. Sparkly, shiny, reflects the colors of its surroundings beautifully. My friend loves it."
0,"This is a fairly nice looking stone with significant shine. However, the workmanship was not as impressive as I had hoped and I didn't meet my personal standards. I gave it to my 15-year old daughter rather than take the time to return it."
1,"Beautiful pendant, Just as described in the picture, but more radiant. Yes it has jaggered edges, that what so unique! Love it & I have had so many compliments on this one."
1,"I ordered a product from this company, and in 48 hours, it was in my mail box. I love what they sent me. I will do business withSabrina again, and I lok forward to it. I can't believe the speed and the quality of what they sent me. I am extremely happy."
1,Recently bought this. Its well made solid clasp and looks just like the picture. Its a heavier wider bracelet on the wrist and so it stands out. A good purchase.
1,"Was extremely satisfied with quality of necklace. The actual packaging was absolutely above and beyond. It was a blue velveteen folder type that made a beautiful presentation. I could not have been any more pleased with the price, quality and service."
0,"I just received those earrings and was very disappointed. They're a lot lighter than I thought, the clasp doesn't close very well and the frame is very thin.I will probably be returning these!"
1,I love pearls and I love silver so this is a perfect anklet for all of your summer whites. I have small ankles so being able to adjust the size is great.Gem Avenue service is good as well.
0,"I loved the look of these earrings, but quickly found their flaw"
1,Very pretty and classy Love them. Merchant give good service and reasonable cost.
1,"I love this belly button ring! It got to me super fast, it's cute, and it doesn't feel all cheap. You'll love it, buy it! :)"
1,"I bought this for my jewelry fanatic friend because I thought it would be an unusual and cool gift. I ended up ordering one for myself. It's so unique, like a glass sculpture. They are very beautiful and comfortable. I recieve compliments all the time. They also deliver very quickly in very nice packaging."
0,The item was misrepresented. Size and quality were horrible. I would return this item except family member is in the Coast Guard and it was sent to him. A total waste of money.
1,"Although we sent the necklace and earrings back because my wife already had a similar set, they were very nice quality and consistency. The return process was without a hitch."
1,"i bought these for my niece's birthday. she wanted earrings that she could sleep in. she loved the color and i was impressed by the size. they were not too big but definitely made her feel like she's a ""big girl"". excellent quality."
1,"These are great earrings-the stones are great quality, although they are lighter than shown in the picture. I liked these earrings so much that I bought them in 4 other colors. I have purchased them for presents for others, and get compliments all the time."
0,The concept to the necklace was really nice. The poem in it is cute. But the necklace looks cheap. I could have gotten that same necklace from a street vendor for half the price. The cord is way too short and it's way overpriced. I was disappointed totally!
0,"I bought these for High school/College graduates. Unfortunately, the cord length for the necklace is rather short. Both girls loved the necklace, the idea behind it, but had to put the pendant on another chain/cord."
1,"I do love this ring and I wear it all the time. I bought it to wear when my husband and I go on vacation so I don't have to worry about losing my real ring. The stone is already lose but it is a $50 ring and not a $5000 ring. Almost every time I leave the house I get a compliment on this ring. My mom cannot tell the different between this ring and my real wedding ring. It is a little bulkier then the picture leads one to believe, but it is still a wonderful ring. If anything happens and the stone does fall out, I will probably buy another ring because of how much I love this ring."
1,"I was very pleased with these earrings when I saw them. Very attractive, even better than I expected. Lovely design. Worked well as a gift."
1,"I wanted a southwestern charm, and this one works. It's very detailed and easy to tell what the symbols are. Very unique addition to my charm bracelet."
1,I got this ring so that I would have something that would match a pair of earrings I had. This ring is perfect. It shines beautifully and I don't think anyone but a jeweler would be able to tell the difference at first glance. I love my ring. I think it's perfect. I think the sellers helped make the experience a lot better. By far one of the best sellers I've dealt with on Amazon thus far. Gorgeous gorgeous ring!!
1,This item unfortunatley did not fit but I loved the ring so much and the packaging I ordered myself another one and kept this on to give away! I WILL be purchasing from this vendor again and again
1,"For $8, you can't get a prettier ring. I wear mine all the time. It's not perfect, but seriously, if you're looking for perfection with $8. . .I don't know what to tell you. I'm seriously considering buying the other shapes of solitaire rings that Gem Avenue has for sale. Awesome!!"
1,"You get exactly what you are looking at, no surprises...a beautiful sparkly ring. It arrived quickly in a pretty gift box, and my wife loved it - unfortunately I got the wrong size, so I am returning for the right size...and so far the return process is going smoothly!"
1,"I bought this for my younger sister, she had her first prom and it matched her dress (which was a midrift bearing dress) perfectly, the product was described perfectly and it is still in great condition and it has been almost 6 months"
1,"These are beautiful, well made earrings. I am very satisfied with this purchase and encourage people to buy these, especially at the sale price!"
1,"These cuff links are just so gorgeous and classy, you must get them for your favorite, well-dressed man. Touch of Luxury has wonderful customer service, they ship their items super fast to you and you receive your cuff links beautifully gift-wrapped too. I was very impressed with their service and quality of jewelry.Thanks ever so much Touch of Luxury and I hope to do business again with you soon!"
1,"Not too clunky but not too girly. It's different and unique. I put together a wish list for my birthday last year but ended up buying this for myself, because I figured my boyfriend wouldn't think it was 'girly' enough and wouldn't get it for me. In fact, he LOVES it and has asked me before why I don't wear it too much (due to exczema)."
0,When I bought this ring it was a size 8. Its a lot bulkier than most other rings which turns that size 8 to about a size 10 or 11. So the finger it was intended for didn't fit. So if you're interested watch out for that.
1,"I live in a place where Halloween is huge. So, of course, I wanted to go above and beyond for it. And this pendant was fantastic.I was Bastet (Egyptian cat goddess) for Halloween, but my problem was that I didn't have a scarab necklace that she's usually seen having around her neck. So I took my problem here and found the perfect one.The scarab is a good size and, like the product title says, it's made of pewter. The cord it came on had to be sacrificed to make it more ornate (with glass beads) and I was saddened that I had to cut the leather cord. The cord has a beautiful knot that allows it to adjust to the size you want it. Honestly, the cord is nice, but rather plain. It clashed terribly against my costume.Now I know I said I wore it solely for Halloween, but it is a great necklace for whenever you want it. I wear mine when I'm out and about. The pewter shines nicely when sunlight hits it.And it arrived fast. I couldn't be happier with it."
1,This ring is beautiful.It is of very high quality.Everone that has seen it has admired it.My wife is very pleased with the ring.
1,There isn't a stockingMy sum is recovered
1,"I love the ring! The design is cool, especially if, like me, you like Yin Yang. I ordered it one size to big, but slipped it on my middle finger and it fits fine. So now when I shoot people the bird, they know I am a well-balanced person. Haha. Anyways, the ring is great, my finger never turned green, and I highly recommend it!Also, I bought from Dan Jewelers, so I highly recommend them as well!"
0,"In the picture it doesn't look as bulky as it really is. I got it for my middle finger and it looks SOO big. If it had said men's ring I wouldn't have ordered it. It fit, but it's obviously not a woman's ring or even unisex."
1,i got this for my son when he was 17 or 18. was an xmas gift. im pretty sure he liked it!
1,"I bought these pearls for my wife but, I bought them to make a pair of panties special. [...] has a pair of panties that has a string of pearls on it well those ones are fake so i bought a strand of pearls to make them real my wife loves the pearls and panties, oh wait so do i."
1,"We love this ring. Everyone thinks it is real, including people who know what to look for. We will definitely be purchasing from you again soon!"
1,"I bought one expensive platinum + diamond ring for my wife that we afraid it would get damage from wearing it everyday, but instead she would wear it on special occasion. On the other hand, the sterling silver cubic zirconia ring would be okay for everyday wear. It had fooled some of my wife's friends into believing that it was an expensive one. I don't know it would fade/tarn like other reviewer indicated. Time will tell, but for the price it probably worth it. Only one thing, I wish the seller would send/mail out the ring asap since we know how much a $ 4.99 shipping cost would be for this light weight item is ... similar seller charges for only $2.99 for similar item ... then the seller should keep in mind of the buyer expectation and you know what I mean ..."
0,I've ordered from Gem Ave before (2x) the band is not 3mm and looks cheapyou get what you pay for. The package was ripped and the box was what looks like pulled apartthe plastic bag the boxed ring came in looked like it had punch though. On top if I'm wanting to returnit I have to pay shipping which was cost of half the puchase not worth it I'll give it to my niece very disappiontedGem Ave
1,I LOVE this ring! I wear it with my wedding band that is platinum and everyone beleives it is real!
0,Not like the pic! Band is very thin. Looks extremely cheap! Don't think of purchasing. Thinking of sending mine back.
1,"This ring is real sterling silver the stone is clear cubic zirconia, its beautifully packaged and for the price ,I got value for my money with this one."
1,I got this ring and it was even more pretty than the picture. I have had lots of compliments about it.
1,I love the ring! The diamond is much bigger than i expected! Its a good looking ring for the price
1,"Just got this ring in the mail, and I am very impressed! For the price, I was expecting much less, but this ring is very elegant yet simple and petite. It's very sparkly, too! I'm using this as a temporary wedding ring while I wait 3 weeks for my other ring being fixed, but in the meantime, I really like it. Can't yet comment on durability, but I think the stone could pass for a real diamond. Very pretty!"
1,"My ring is beautiful! The setting, band size is great! Just what I wanted."
1,It looks like the real thing. Cubic Zirconia jewelry is very popular these days and this particular jewelry item shows why!
0,"Why oh why do the people who make CZ rings insist on having the stones be eqivalent to 1 ct + diamonds. I looked for an inexpensive .5 CZ for over a week and finally bought this one even though I thought it was a little big. It is, it looks slightly bigger than a 1 ct diamond, and it looks fake. I did find some .5 CZ from a couple of ""high end CZ"" sellers, but they wanted over $150 for the end product.., way more than I was willing to spend.My .5 ct solitaire diamond engagement ring went missing, but I still had the ""wrap"" that went around it to complete my wedding band set, (I still have no idea how they became seperated, and suspected theft).., and I ordered this to fit in wedding set.., it did fit. I wear a 9, and the band was actually closer to an 8.5, so it just barely fit. (and you may want to order up if you choose this ring) The band looks a little smaller than pictured, but I think that's just because the stone is really too big to look real. The band is comfortable though, and even though I think it was sized slightly small, it is a decent band. The stone is set a little high for me.I read a lot of reviews in my hunt for this ring, and I think the sellers could really benefit from reading this.., BUYERS WANT ACCESS TO .25 AND .5 CZ'S THAT ARE STILL IN BANDS OF REAL METAL, and priced well. One of the prongs was bent outward a little, but that was easy to fix. Overall, for the price, I would have to list it as a good purchase.., the quality of the CZ, the band, and the setting were all very good for the price.., and because the description was accurate as to the size of the stone, I gave it 3 stars.PS. I found my diamond ring! No one stole it, it was under a dresser.., still have no idea how that happend...,"
1,"Five years and counting, that's how long my wife and I've been married and she still thinks her engagement ring is real. Well, I owe it all to the jewelry magicians over at Gem Avenue. Having to get married was bad enough, but no way was I going to shell out the long green for a relationship I wasn't even sure was going to last. So when I found out $7.99 was all I had to cough up to quiet down my old lady and lock in a cush job at her Dad's cardboard box factory, it didn't take me long to pop the ol' question. Criminy, I spent more on the dinner at Bennigans than I did for the ring. It was that darn potato skins appetizer that put me over. Anywho, she totally went for it, and to this day she still thinks it's a genuine carat diamond. Sure, she only has one good eye resulting from a freak macram&eacute; accident, but her family and friends seem to have bought off on it too. And when the old conscience flares up and I start to think maybe my whole marriage was based on a big lie, I like to tell myself that I'm not fooling my wife so much as I'm embracing a new cost saving technology."
1,"I purchased this ring for myself, and I get so many comments on it when I wear it! It is so pretty and dazzling and bright on your finger..you will love this ring!!"
1,this product is amazing. the band like many mention is smaller than it appears on the picture but i'm perfectly fine with that.i have gotten many compliments since the moment i first wore it. i am very pleased with it. its small and simple but beautiful. the stoneshines like a real diamond and it looks amazing on. i recommend it to anyone looking for something affordable and cute.
1,"I am glad I purchased this ring, it now one of her favorites! I like everything about it and and she loves it. I choose 5 stars because it made really happy. I would recommend this ring and others I purchase to any of my female friends and/or the boyfriends, husbands, and whatever.Thank you"
1,I like the ring alot is perfect i just hope it does last and nothing happens to it
1,Well I just want to say this is a beautiful ring and it is making my wife's day. I love it its the best.
1,"This is a beautiful ring and for the money, it is a great value! I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised by the quality."
0,This ring isnt very durable. The gem feels loose and the metal isnt very solid. It looks good but the quality isnt there. Great for a highschooler or a cheap promise ring. My girlfriend liked it though. But really its the thought that counts!
1,"I bought this along with another solitaire as backup to my real gold and diamonds set. The stone is large enough to be noticable, but not gaudy and fake as some of the larger stones. Its a simple and elegant look. My hands are smaller, so the smaller stone looks realistic. My husband was even impressed! I like that its sterling and not a plated metal, so it will stand up to all the cleaning solutions my hands are in. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes understated elegance. Its definitely not for someone who likes in-your-face flash."
1,looks just like the picture
1,I absolutely love this ring and hardly ever take it off. It's brilliance is uncomparable.I ordered a plain band to forcus mainly on the beautiful heart ring.
1,this ring is beautiful. i see that one person got a foggy cz but i must say mine is gorgeous. the sparkle is amazing. i am very pleased with this ring.
0,This charm bracelet is cute. The charms are larger I thought than they looked in the photo. I found it too cumbersome but my little girl enjoys it.
0,this is misleading because i thought i was getting the necklass with it so i wasnt happy :( they should not have the actuall necklass in the pic of the product they were trying to sell .
1,"My husband bought me this ring 3 yrs ago to go with my wedding band. I wanted something different big pretty but not pricey or cheap looking. Love my ring am a nurse and very hard on my jewelry. This ring takes a beating and holds up well. The stone as come out once while I was moving boxes. I hit it just right and felt it ""pop"". No trouble getting it back it and never has come out since. I get lots of compliments too in fact a co worker bought a simlar ring because she liked mine so much. If you want big and pretty this ring is for you."
1,I gave this ring as a gift to my 13-year-old niece and she loves it because no one will have one like it when she returns to school from summer vacation.
1,I love this ring. It was such a good deal and looks great with my wedding ring.
1,The response and quality of service was excellent. The product quality and appearance are very good.
1,"I bought this gold chain for my husband for his birthday. It came in a nice gift box and is really beautiful, even better than the picture of it. He wears a couple of things on the chain, a medical alert and one other and the chain handles them both very well. The length was perfect too. So, I was pleased that he was happy with it."
0,"This is very nice - but not as a pendant. More like for a keychain, which is what I will use it for. Little too large and bulky for a pendant."
1,MY WIFE LOVES THE PENDANT AND NOW WEARS IT OFTEN AS SHE CONNECTSWITH MARINE MAMALS AND VOLUNTEERS AT A RECOVERY CENTER
1,"I ordered these ear rings for my mother inlaw for Christmas. I recieved them quickly and they were so beautiful! they were exactly what I expected, only more beautiful. I have the same taste as her so I wanted to keep them for myself! I saw her wearing them the next day and she said she loves them! They exceeded my expectations!!!!! :)"
1,This came in very quickly and packaged very nicely. I would order again from this company!
1,"I love this hammer, this is the 2nd one I have purchased from Dan Jewelers as the 1st one I lost along with my necklace."
1,I love these earrings for my 5 1/2 year old daughter! I purchased one of each color and she loves matching them to what she is wearing. These are excellent for children!
1,"These earrings are so pretty and delicate - perfect for my 9 year old ""girly-girl"". They shipped quickly, were packaged appropriately. The Price was reasonable for excellent quality. :)"
0,"I ordered these based on the positive reviews as a gift for a 7-yr old girl. They are definitely very small, almost translucent compared to the photo, and are a bit flimsy. One of the earrings arrived with a bent post, so the backing does not slide on well and is crooked. Not really sure it's suitable to give as a gift. Not worth the price."
1,I enjoy the look of this ring and I wear it all the time.
1,"Bought this pin for my mother, she collects Just the Right Shoe. This pin is very detailed in the appearance, as well as it is nicely weighted. Not thin and cheaply made. Would definitely buy again."
1,Amazon did a great job with this - exactly what I hoped it would be. My wife loved them...better than my disappointing Pugster pin I got in the same order.
1,anyone who is a Patriot's fan will love these. They are bigger than I thought they would be which was a pleasant surprise.
1,"This is not just a Goth classic, but is a beautiful rendering of a wolf head in mid-bark! I love mine. Details are amazing, right down to the teeth! Being pewter, it is fairly heavy, but still comfortable to wear. A must for wolf-lovers. Not sure why it is called a werewolf..."
0,"I live an active lifestyle. When I wear any kind of necklace, I worry about it breaking. This is the 1st pendant I own made of pewter. When I examined it, one of the wings got bent. I don't wear it. I put a split ring on the bail of the pendant and hung it on my wall for decoration. I am very lucky that it did not break. My suggestion"
0,Kinda cheap looking but its ok. Its a little bigger than I expected and the rope its on is very cheap.
1,"I love the way this butterfly compliments my bussiness suit. It gives it a warm, colorful and playful tone. Very very cute and finely crafted."
1,"I ordered the Skull Thor's Hammer at the beginning of the week, and recieved it under a week later. Speedy delivery is always note worthy. It arrived on the same day as another Mjolnir pendant I paid over triple the price for . . . and I must say . . . I'm VERY impressed. The craftsmanship is superb on this pendant. Additionally I bought a silk chord to put it on, only to realize I didn't need it, as the chord included is very nice, and has a great adjustible set up. If all the Dan's Jewelry pieces of of this quality, I see no reason to buy from anywhere else."
1,I gave it fives stars for arriving on time and just as described on the web site. The rest is up to your taste.
1,"These earrings are very pretty and stylish. The little crystals at the bottom sparkle in the sun. You can make them shorter by pulling the string through your ear, but you have to make sure you always have a back on them because than they will fall out. I have had them for about a week and i wear them everyday they are just that beautiful, but i didnt have a back on them and one fell out and i lost it. So you bet your ass that i went online and purchased another pair. Trust me you will not be disappointed."
1,I absolutely love these threaders. I have a special love for threaders and these met with my approval. They are very elegant and are great for formal evenings or if you just feel like wearing pearls. They are lightweight and the pearl does not drag the threader out of your ear. I would buy them again.
1,"These little earrings are very cute. They are a little smaller than I had anticipated, but they are perfect for my 8 year old. This seller is awesome as well. The earrings were well packaged and got here super fast."
1,"I purchased these as a stockin' stuffer for my cat-lovin' 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loves them! If you have a kiddo who is really into cats, these are the earrings for her! Or for Mommy...I borrow them! :)"
1,"it showed up very quickly and in great condition.The downfall would be that the ring image isn't very truthful because when it showed up it had literally no gloss to it.but if you're looking for a darker ring, this is perfect."
1,LOve this. My husband hasn't taken it off. Really hope I can find similar things for him. Great Necklace :)
0,"I would have rated the necklace higher but the one I received was not as blue in color as the picture. The necklace is quite nice and I do wear it. I do like the design. However, perhaps the color may have to do with the translation between computer screen color and actual metal color."
1,The pewter Celtic pendant looks better than its picture. I also liked the adjustable rope chain that came with it. It allows me to wear it long or short.
1,"Absolutely gorgeous ring! Exceeded my expectations for the price. So shiny, looks great on finger. Anyone who purchases this product will not be disappointed. Would highly recommend seller!"
1,I just got my ring today and it definitely exceeded my expectations for the price I paid for it. I was amazed at how the stones sparkle. This is definitely quality cubic zirconia. I would recommend this ring to anyone who's looking for sparkle and shine without the huge price tag of real diamonds. Love it.
1,This a great buy. It has all the glamor of diamond without the high cost. Its Cubic Zirconia at its best.
1,I love this ring i dont were rings at all but i were this one everyday i just love how it looks and how it just fits right
0,"It is okay for the price. I will wear it out in the evening, but it doesn't look real at all."
1,"I bought this ring as a 'back-up' ring (like many other reviewers) not expecting much. I thought 'what the heck it's so cheap, how bad can it be?' It was exactly like it looks, Now I haven't had it long, so I don't know if my finger will turn green in a few months, but I have had it for about a week. The fit was perfect for the size I ordered. The CZ's are beautiful, well set. The metal part of the ring-I don't know that it is really silver-appears to look like Silver. Much better quality than what you'd buy in Mexico in their 'Silver' department, and for a lot less. Will I wear this one all the time? No, but it'll do for what I bought it for, and I would recommend it."
0,"I ordered this ring as a present for myself, but I returned it because it looked really fake--it looks like it came out a dime store the stones are too big, the silver band is too thin, and it was sized too large. Then I had to wait ages for Amazon to reimburse me (which they finally did, thank you!)."
0,"I regret buying this. A week after I got it, one of the side stones fell out. Not worth the money!"
1,"This ring almost has a life of it's own.As soon as a light hits it,it comes alive."
1,"i bought this gift for my mom and i have a policy if more than 3 people give it one star i dont buy it but when i got it, it was perfect and my mom loved it. I would have been much more happy if it was wrap though"
1,"Well lets get the fact portions out of the way for you review skimmers. This is a wonderful ring with a amazing silver band, stones that shine very bright, plus all 3 stones are the same size and cut.Now this is the part where I tell my little story. I got this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend. She reacted in that wonderfully classic way with the jumping, hugging, and kissing. This ring was a winner to me, and I was to her. My advise is get this if you want to get the same reaction as I did."
1,"The stones are bigger than the picture, but are the perfect size. The CZs are of great quality and the pricing for the quality delivered is phenomenal. The only complaint I have with this ring is that inscribed on the inside of the band is china and CZs (I find the china inscription part tacky), so if you want to show this off keep it on your hand.Other than that small hiccup it's perfect. I would definitely buy this ring again it's a great ring."
1,"You will love it.First time I've bought jewerly on line and was pretty anxious about it... but reading the reviews, I decided to go for it and was a great decision. It's really beautiful and looks very expensive."
0,"I was very disappointed with this ring. All three stones were different sizes and looked extremely fake. I don't understand why other reviewers said this could pass as the real thing, but it's differently cheap looking. Quite a shame as it looked nice in the picture."
0,The stones in the ring looked fake. They sent me the wrong size. Wasn't happy .
1,"Ok, so I didn't tell them it wasn't real...but, should I have to divulge all my secrets??Ive had this ring for several months now, it still looks great!"
0,the quality suckyou shouldn't sale this anymorei threw it away as soon i saw the quality of the merchandise
1,I wanted this ring once I saw it. It is so pretty. I have received many compliments on it. I'm so happy with my purchase.
1,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved it. She wouldn't take it off. it looks better then the picture. Shipping was also very quick!!!
1,"Was a bit skeptical when I ordered this ring, but I have had so many compliments on it, they think it is the real deal, (I don't say otherwise). Looks beautiful and the size was perfect. Can't stop admiriing it."
1,"I was looking for a fake engagement/wedding ring to throw off some unwanted flirtations, and this does the trick. I've had several family members ask if I was engaged. It's nicer than the ring my ex-husband gave me (though that thing set a pretty low bar). I love the way it sparkles too, I wear it all the time and it's very comfortable."
1,Its a very beautiful ring. Had to order one for my buff. My daughter wants one now. Great quality. Buy one.
1,"wanted something nice & shiny!! It's Great! The price was a steal, came in a nice little jewelry bag..,,,,,,,,,, ;"
1,"I lost my 3 carat wedding ring and my husband said he wouldn't by me another one. So, I saw this on amazon and it is really a nice little piece. I get compliments all of the time."
1,"This was by far the most amazing ring for the price i was so impressed when i received it, I immediatley purchased another for my friend. It literally has more sparkle than my real diamonds and what woman dosen't love sparkle?"
1,"This ring is a pretty good size ring and as soon as it was placed on my girlfriend, she melted. Two thumbs up for this item. She was NOT disappointed!"
1,"This ring is so beautiful. I Like it because it doesn't make my finger green LOL!I get compliments on it all the time. It is so beautiful! Guys, get this for your girlfriends... You wont regret it!"
1,I love this ring it is not to big to look fake. If you want a beautiful simple diamond ring this is the ring for you. It looks so good on your hand. Your friends will be looking at your hand all the time.
1,I bought This Ring For My Girlfriend and She LOVED it. It was good quality and it doesn't look cheap. Great Buy!
1,"My wedding ring didn't fit me after my first trimester. Found this ring on Amazon, very reasonably priced and I love it. It's beautiful. None of my friends and family can tell the difference between this one and my wedding ring that is real diamonds. Makes me think we wasted a lot of money on the original wedding ring!!"
0,"i expected more from this ring, i can find this kind of ring in some fashion store for 10$....but oh well i like it cause m husband gave it to me"
1,"I ordered this ring a week ago and love the look, it really looks better than the picture on the computer.The ring looks like my sister's wedding band that her husband paid thousands of dollars for."
1,"This ring far exceeded my expectations and looks better in real life than in the picture shown here on Amazon. The CZ's really sparkle and the silver is very white, shiny, and high quality. Overall I am very pleased with this ring and prefer it to my white gold, yellow gold, and other silver rings. Do not be too concerned about the silver holding up. I have a silver ring I have worn for 3 years and it's in fine condition. Inside, the ring is stamped CHINA 925 CZ, so you will not fool anyone with it but it is gorgeous and fun to wear. For $19.99 you cannot go wrong. Save yourself some money and buy this ring if you want a 3 stone ring. This ring cleans easily with mild hand dishwashing liquid, warm water, a soft baby toothbrush, and a soft lint-free cloth. The ring appears to be rhodium plating so I would avoid silver cleaners."
1,"I ordered this ring after purchasing and returning two rings of a similar design from another (anonymous) merchant. Needless to say I was deeply unhappy with the other products. But this ring blew me away. It is even more beautiful in person than the picture leads you to believe. I have wanted a 3 stone ring for some time now and at this price I can say it was a steal. Plus I'll never have to worry about losing a ""real"" diamond. I definately recommend this to anyone desiring a quality CZ ring."
1,And I don't mean AMAZING as used loosly on the Batchelor!! This was a beautiful ring to see the sparkle and shine is exceptional. The fit perfect. I just love it. Wonderful.
0,"I probably should have taken it off when I washed my hands. The silver or whatever started rubbing off and it looked not so good. I had lost my real diamond and was using this as a replacement. For the money, I was hoping it would last longer. But, to my surprise my husband bought me a new diamond for Christmas! This looked really nice at first, but I would definitely take it off before putting your hands in water for any reason or doing any kind of work. Just wear it when you need to and store it when not in use. I probably could have gotten more use out of it."
0,"This ring is very pretty, but obviously fake. If I saw this ring in the store I probably would not buy it. I would go to a department store and browse their rings before buying this one. They are about the same price and would probabaly make someone wonder more than this one would."
0,"It's a nice fake, but obviously. Either my fingers have shrunk or this ring runs big. I bought it just to decide if I want a 3 stone ring to wear as my wedding band. It would be fine by its self but I would prefer a four or five stone ring to wear as a set. Good deal for the dollar!"
1,"I ordered this ring for me and my girlfriends anniversary. It looked great and with the low price I couldn't pass it up. It was well worthy it!The ring got here in 2 days (sure they just left it on my porch without knocking but I expected as much) well wrapped. It came In a small white padded gift box, with the ring itself in a bag. When I gave it to her her face lit up! The ring has a very fine silver for the base, and the stones have a beautiful sparkle (I spent about 15 in a dark room shining a flashlight at it. Extremely impressive!).She spent the entire next day showing it off to everyone she knew and even got compliments from strangers. I highly recommend this ring for that special lady in your life!"
1,Verry beautiful! Definitely a head turner. Came fast. Came with a cute lil bag an box. Doesn't five me the green ring like mosr rings do for me.
1,"Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly.Very shiny, bright and fits perfectly."
1,For the price you can't beat this rings looks. Sparkles just right. Its not diamonds mind you but for the time being can't get a better deal
1,So pleased with this purchase. Its description and picture was just like indicated. It's a great option to the real thing!
0,"SO i purchased this ring a few months ago just to wear as a ploy to keep men from bothering me..its dont the trick until recently. The ""diamonds"" are very foggy looking no matter how i clea them and it is changing colors and the stones are very loose. I would say great ring if you are only planning to wear it for the short term but not a longterm every day wear."
1,"The ring looks just as good in person as it does online. Everything looks very high quality, and the price you pay for it is definitely worth it. I don't have anything else to say other than if you want to buy a ring like this, go for it! There's honestly nothing to lose."
1,I was very pleased when i received this ring.! Not bad at all. Very sparkly and a fun addition to wear.
1,"I cannot express how delighted I am with this ring. Who needs diamonds?? I get compliments every time I wear it, today from a manicurist. If I weren't the soul of honesty, I'd let them believe it's the real thing. Ordering 2 more for my sister and daughter-in-law."
1,"What a great looking ring! Very pretty and realistic looking, love the look. Wish it was a 6.5 but well worth the purchase!!!"
1,I was a fantastic ring and fits true to its size it is very sparkly in person and i would defiantly recommend buying this ring if your looking for something to wear with anything and that is durable
1,"I'm 17 now i bought this ring as a present to myself for my 15th birthday. It hasn't faded at all and i wear it everyday. The stones sparkle beautifully in the light. My teachers and people i pass on the street always say the same thing, ""that looks very expensive"". I love it"
1,This ring is stunning WAY more then i expected it is SOOO shiny lots and lots of shine i LOVE it. It will be part of my daily wardrobe now :)
1,I love this ring! It rivals the real thing at a fraction of the price. I have gotten lots of compliments every time I wear it.
0,I bought one good ring for a good price here on amazon. This one looked nice and was nicely priced so I ordered it. It looks really cheap (can tell in minus one second that it's not a real diamond). I've seen nicer out of a gumball machine. Was really disappointed.
1,"I only got this today, so I can't write about how well it stays overtime. First impression, though, was really great. It was a lot shinier than I expected. Looking at other pictures, I thought the stones were going to look huge and gaudy on my finger, but it looks nice. No bad comments here!"
0,"I was really excited to order this ring after reading all of the glowing reviews but when I received it I was very disapointed however, for the price what did I expect? Picture looks WAY better than the real thing!"
0,Not very convincing. Stones are cloudy. It is fake looking and silver looks dull rather than shiny. Will keep looking for fake fabulous.
1,"My wife needed a ring to wear since her actual wedding ring was lost. We were not expecting a one million dollar ring of course. But what arrived not only turned our heads, her co-workers actually noticed this ring more than they ever noticed her old ring. The Cubic Zirconia looks authentic enough under basic scrutiny that we may never go back to a diamond ring again. Me myself, my wedding ring has always been just a silver band but I believe this ring truly defies the subliminal misconception that she deserves a diamond.Great for your temporary ring, or if she doesnt care about price, a perfect choice for those who want to turn heads without breaking the bank"
1,This is an awesome ring that fit perfectly it is just as pretty add it looked and for a good price
1,"After losing my beautiful wedding ring a few months ago, I decided that I was not going to make an investment like that again, so I went looking for something that could replace the naked spot on my finger. I ordered this ring because the price could not be beat, and I have received many compliments on it. I am very satisfied with this item."
0,I did not like the ring and it looks extremely fake and it shines too much! Not a worth to buy
0,"I don't like it all, I'm going to return it. Even for the price I paid, it's not worth it!"
1,I love the feel of it on my finger and it really sparkles and shines. It is a great wear for a special occasion and would be a great gift to many.
0,Stones are cloudy and tinted kind of yellow in certain light but then again the price is right isn't it? The silver is stamped very small inside the ring but it is also stamped CHINA very large - much bigger then the silver stamp - kinda of cheap if you ask me....
1,"this was for one of my buddies to give to his gf and he was suprised at how good it looks, it looks great definately work the money, he loved it and i will seriously consider buying in the future, also shipping time was great"
1,"The ring is so beautiful, it's clean, classy, and the diamonds reflect light beautifully. I recommend this if you are unsure!"
0,"I couldn't tell by the way the this ring was portrayed from Amazon that the stones were so small !! I love wearing cubics but I like them big. If you are going with fake, might as well get BIG ones. I will probably give this one away"
1,"Some people wear a cross, I wear a pentagram. It's about an inch in diameter, and really does look like it was made from sticks and vines. The cord that comes with it is adjustable in a very nifty way. I just love it because i expresses who I am without all the gaudy jewels and unnecessary things."
1,"i ordered this several years ago. i love it! i wear a crucifix, star of david, budda, and this. great conversation piece. perfect size for either a man or woman."
1,i like my italian horn.it is not rusting my neck because of the white gold.it is nice and dainty and great for the price.
1,"This is an amazing ring. It's width and color are perfect, it has a very comfortable fit and is very lightweight. I bought it as a gift and messed up the size so I had to change it, but it pained me since it was so great and they didn't have the right size. The service was great. Delivered on perfect time.Great ring."
1,"this is the best jewelry cleaner i have used so far.i bought it for my chain and i was shining, even more than when it was new ...ITS MAGIC !!"
1,"I bought this product to clean my new engagement ring. Not only does it actually smell good, it really works! My friends comment how sparkley my ring always is, I recommend it everyone!"
0,"I was not satisfied with this product at all.I used a product before that only required putting the jewelry in the solution for 15-30 minutes and it came out radiant. With this product, I left my ring in overnight, had to scrub it with a toothbrush, and there were still traces of ""build up"" in some of the crevices of my ring.It was way too expensive for the less than satisfactory results I received. I also emailed the company to let them know I was dissatisfied and asked for a refund (since they say they have a money back guarantee) but never received a reply.I was also annoyed it was around $5.00 for shipping but all I got was an empty plastic container, a ""refill"" packet, and directions on how to make the cleaning solution.If you want this product, just get the refill packet instead of the whole thing."
0,I thought the earrings were beautiful and I got exactly what was specified. It came in a timely manner and I would shop with this company again in a heart beat.
1,"I am pleased with this ring. My fingers and hands are petite so it looks good and fits good. Because the ring is very narrow the design is not a ""stand out"". But it still looks good on my finger."
1,"I received these earrings today and am delighted with them. I read the reviews carefully, so I knew the actual size of this item, and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are. The presentation (bag and box) is beautiful -- looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store. I've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in."
1,These earrings are 20mm in length so they are fairly small. They look beautiful with well cut quartz that sparkle against 14k yellow gold. I think I would find a lot of use for them as they can be used for everyday wear. I would definitely recommend them as long as you are aware of the true length.
0,The picture is very misleading. The items are much smaller that the picture leads you to believe. I do like the earrings but I believe the price is too high for the quality of the item.
0,"the product is very very small and the photo and description leads you to believe that it is larger. it was a christmas gift but i could not give it, no way. i better ask for measurements next time.The delivery time was good."
1,"i bought these for my girlfriend last year on a gold box deal, and sprung them on her on new years eve 2008, she loves them, they were a little smaller than i imagined...but they are very classy and elegant, not too dressy, but not overly casual...they could easily be worn everyday"
0,I bought this as a gift on 18th December 2008 and they charged me 64.99. On Dec 19th 2008 the price was 39.99. I wouldnt buy anything from these rip offs again.
1,"I bought these for a gift. They are beautiful, good quality earrings. They are exactly as described. These are dainty, feminine earrings--very pretty on someone with short hair. I'm seriously thinking about buying a pair for myself.Some put in their reviews that the earrings were much smaller than expected. I found this pretty funny--even breakfast cereal is pictured larger than actual size on the box. I believe ""enlarged to show detail"" is the expression. I hope most people get that you have to look at the actual dimensions to know what size the product is."
1,It's so gorgeous! Considering its 14K gold and I only paid less than $50 for it!I hope there's a matching necklace...
0,These earrings are much smaller than the picture indicates. They are cute but the price is too high for the quality you receive.
1,"These earrings are dainty and cute. If you are looking for something bold and striking, I would not recommend them. They are about 20mm in the length, fairly small. The amethysts are a beautiful color and look perfect with the 14k gold. I bought these as a gift for my mom and I think they are a steal for under $40."
1,"December, blue topaz,beautiful, drop earrings,I wore them for Christmas & got many coments on how beautiful they are. I love them, I will get more of them, they are beautiful.."
0,These photograph well but are rather cheap-looking up close. For what I paid I expected better craftsmanship.
1,"The wife ordered these to wear on St. Patricks Day, but will wear them many more times! She is very pleased with the quality, style, and the size. The Celtic pattern is beautiful, and the square design is unique. She likes that they are stationary on the ear instead of bouncing around. The fish-hook is not her favorite, but they seem to disappear behind the lobe, which is a good thing! The size of the square design is on the small side, but is still noticable and pretty. The quality of the sterling silver cutouts is well executed and clean, making the earrings look more expensive than they were!"
0,These are terrible... I will return them they do not hang well and at the base of the stem it doesn't dangle.. it is all one piece which means as you store them the stem turns and will break ... don't even try it
1,"This is a wonderful jewelry cleaning product that I have used for years. With the new formulation you add your own water to the Pearls solution, so you are not paying for the water only the cleaner. It is a great value and lasts a long time."
1,I love this cleaner! It leaves my jewelry sparkling and I like that it is very gentle with no harsh chemical smell like many other cleaners. The Radiance 2000 restores an amazing shine to my pieces.
1,"The stone is a more subdued blue than it shows in the picture, but that could be due to my monitor more than any misrepresentation. The band is thick enough to feel very sturdy without feeling bulky. The prongs holding the stones do not snag at all (which is a problem I commonly have with cheaper jewelry). The stones have a wonderful sparkle. Overall, it's a gorgeous ring!"
1,It is just a beautiful ring. Ordered sz 5 and fits perfect. I have small hands and the amethyst stone is just the right size. The stone looks lighter in the photo so I was happy when I opened the box and saw that it is darker.
0,I recently won a necklace in a box that looked just like this one.. in a crane machine. I had the same issue with the chain.. I have a feeling this is the same type of necklace.
0,"Don't buy this piece of junk, yes it looks nice but after she wears it a couple times the cheap silver finish will come off and then make her neck turn green! Wow, what a gift! Do her a favor and save for something better or get her nothing cause this is just a waist of money."
1,My daughter absolutely loves this necklace. She is a new mother. I wanted to get her something special from her newborn son.
1,I loved my necklace. The pendant is beautiful. I wish the necklace would have been longer cuz I like them long.
1,"For the price, this necklace is breathtaking to look at. I can't wait until my mom opens this on christmas morning because after our house got flooded she has glued this family back together and she deserves a beautiful necklace! My grandmother said that my mom would cry when she saw it so i cant wait!"
1,"It was very easy to send this product to my Mom for Mother's Day. She was very happy with the product. Plus, it was nice that it came with a poem since I was unable to send a card with it. I would recommend this as a perfect gift for Mother's Day or to a new Mom."
1,"I bought this for my Mom for Mother's Day. She lives 700 miles away and so I had to trust the reviews and hope she liked it. SHE LOVES IT! She called me when she received the package completely estatic! She still proudly wears my gift. I kinda felt ashamed for buying my Mom a cheap gift but times were hard and money was tight. Thankfully, the necklace does not look cheap or cheesy at all. I don't think she realizes how inexpensive it was either! ..... PRICELESS!....."
1,"I am 23 and I bought this for my mom last christmas, she cried when she opened it. She wears it often. To others, and even to her at first, it appears just to be a trendy circle necklace. Once pointed out that it says mom all the way around, the usual reaction is ""aaaawwww, that's so sweet"" It's a great price and a great way to tell mom you love her."
0,This necklace is darling but the chain is extremely short. I placed it on my 6 year old's neck to get an exact idea about the length because it was choking me. It looked like it was made for a child lengthwise after seeing it on my own child. I had to take the necklace apart and add another extender to the other side of it so I could wear it comfortably.
1,I received it in only 3 days and upon opening it was very happy. perfect condition and very pretty. :)
1,"Since I'm only a girl, I'm writing my mom's opinon. ""I think it is very beautiful and sweet."" she said. Well that's all she said. So take my opinon, ""The ""mom""'s around the circle with crystal ""o""s, and the silver ""M""s give beauty in a mother's point of veiw. With the poem inside of the seemingly bow wrapped box helps bring tears to her eyes. The necklace shows elagance in a motherly way, that push the the pleased love tears down her cheaks, and causing her to hug her child or children in a mother tight squeeze."" I say. I'm a ten year old girl who's purchased this necklace for my mother and had these resultes on mother's day."
0,I bought this for my grandaughter to put some of my mom's ashes. The opening hole is very small and difficult to place the ashes.
1,These earings have big impact because of their size and the great shine. The detailing also grabs ones attention.
1,"I am not much into silver jewelries but this pair of sterling silver earrings are beautifully designed. They are light on the ears, unique, and casual but elegant. I am so thrilled to have purchased this pair of earrings."
1,"I was looking for a ring that had clearly engraved celtic knotwork on it. I bought this ring and am perfectly delighted with it! The silver is slightly thinner than I had hoped, so I do worry that it might become misshapen quickly, but hopefully if I am careful that won't be a problem. Using Amazon's sizing chart worked perfectly too. I looked all over the Amazon site and this ring was the only one I found that was this styling... or at least the only one like this that didn't cost an arm and a leg."
0,"This ring is gorgeous and so cute to look at, but it is truly PAINFUL to wear!!! It was cutting into my fingers after only a few minutes of wearing it. I bought it when it was $300 and I sent it back because it wasn't worth it to reset the diamonds in a less sharp setting."
1,"This is a well made product of the highest quality materials. The first thing that impressed me was the stainless steel tub with a mirror-like finish. The digital timer function is very convenient; you can set this thing and let it clean un-attended. So far it has worked well on gold rings and stones, but not very well on neck chains / rope chains. I guess I need to increase the cleaning time. Most impressive cleaning was on a pair of eyeglasses, especially on the edge of the lenses; they came out looking like new! You may also have to experiment with the cleaning cycle times, to obtan the best results. Overall, this unit has exceeded my expectations."
1,"This ring is a nice, light sterling silver ring with a very nice box-like celtic pattern. Its not a heavy ring, and its not a wide band, but the detailing is still fantastic. I'd recommend this ring for a person with smaller fingers or someone who likes a more delicate design. its really a great little ring and wears like your finger is naked ;)"
1,"I'm writing is review after 4 month of wearing this ring, here is what I have noticed:- Durable.- Great looking ring, I have received many compliments over different occasions.- Not suffering from ring marks any more.- Helped in healing my finger after being irritated by the previous ring (by just having those ""holes"" that allowed my skin to breath normaly).- It is only annoying when washing your hands with soap bars (in particular soap BAR) because it gets in those holes and takes little more time to be cleaned. (FYI, this is soooo not a problem, it is just a note).- clean it with silver shining products and you have it shining back as new... (my opinion, I loved it ""matt"" better)I hope this info was usefull for you. Good luck shopping."
1,It is a present to my niece and she carries it all the time and she said that it has brought her luck...-)))
1,I am very pleased with my product as I had lost a ring very similar to it......it looks even better then my original and was delivered right away. Great ring....it's my favorite!
1,I bought this for my girlfriend to replace a similar one that she lost. It is very durable and high quality. The sizing is perfect (not too big or small) and it looks great in combination with other ring(s). Great buy.
1,"This was for my husband's wedding band. He wanted something unique, but I was worried about sterling silver standing the test of time and wear. He has not taken it off for 2 years now and so far so good! no turning colors or bending!"
1,"Very nice, would order again. Fast service and exchange for proper size too. Heavy - and not skimpy. Is as it looks. Very happy."
1,"I gave this pendant to my wife for Valentine's day this year and she was very happy. In fact, she was more than very happy! The product is of great quality and the company is doing a great job at customer satisfaction. I don't think you can go wrong with this gift."
1,"My mother is nearly impossible to shop for...she has everything and does very little in the way of hobbies (reading, gardening, etc.) This was an instant hit. I just hope I can come up with something for next year!"
1,"Simply put, this a a lovely product that isn't too flashy yet very attractive! Bought this as a gift and wasn't disappointed for the purchase. Defiantly recommend this for ladies who have an Industrial bar in the Right Ear, along with a few piercings in both ears, especially if your looking for something to bring balance without adding a long wait on healing for a cartilage piercing."
1,This is a VERY nice earcuff. It is very comfortable to wear and I get a lot of compliments on it. It fits very nicely.
0,"Very disappointed in this product. They were so tiny you could barely see them. They are made for small girls, not women. I promptly sent them back."
1,"I bought these earrings for my niece, and after they arrived, I immediately ordered another pair for myself. I find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture. The size is perfect, and the amethysts, although very small, add just a little color accent. I bought them on sale for $15 instead of the usual $50, and I am very, very pleased with what I got for the price!"
1,"This is day 3 of wearing my QLink SRT-3 Pendant, and I have had a noticeable (yet also subtle) change in my energy levels. It is hard to describe, but the best way I can come up with now is that I feel more solid and grounded then I did before having the Q Link. I have been wearing to sleep the past 2 nights as well and have slept well, but with some vivid dreams, so I don't know if that has anything to do with wearing the pendant or not, but I generally feel just more positive energy around me in general. I feel like before wearing it that there could be some sort of energy-leakages, probably due to constant exposure to EMF /Wi-fi/Cell-phone/Microwave/environmental and ambient interference which is constantly around all of us all the time in this modern world, and I feel like the QLink has helped to stoppage the leaks and it actually has helped to buffer things that make me feel stressed. Don't get me wrong here, it hasn't solved all of my life's problems, but I feel like I have a stronger foundation to do my daily-life activities from while wearing it. I highly recommend it at this point to anyone considering buying one, $90-120 is a lot of money for such a small item, but after my first 3 days of wearing one, I feel that it is well worth it, just wish I had some extra money to buy them for family members too."
0,"Placebo effect. No difference whatsoever, and the manufacturer doesn't honor their 90-day return ""guarantee""; I actually tried reaching them.Now that I am stuck with this thing, I wear it every other day or so ""for fun"". For the past 6 months, never had I felt any difference.I agree with other reviewers that you are just getting a piece of copper wire in a plastic box with a shoelace.What's up with reviews telling us how this little plastic box fixes all their problems? What's up with overwhelming number of people marking them as ""helpful""? I guess I will just remove my review to let people waste their money in peace."
1,"My husband (who's account I'm using) is weather sensitive. He has always had terrible headaches and feels tremendous pressure on his head whenever it rains, is cloudy or there are pressure changes in the weather.I was searching for an ionizer, in hopes of helping him deal with his weather sensitivities, when a wonderful lady in Colorado told me about the Q-Link. I had never heard of it and was of course very skeptical of the product.We paid [...] for two Q-Links and we weren't disappointed. I wear one and my husband wears one. I don't have the same sensitivity he does. However, I spend a great deal of time in front of my computer screen and I've noticed a slight difference, since wearing the Q-Link. I feel much more calm and less frazzled. It's easy to see why these are very popular among golfers.I can also see this being a useful product for those who use BlueTooth or talk on the cell phone a great deal. People are just now starting to become aware of the harmful effects of EMF radiation.If you experience weather sensitivity and simply can't deal with cloudy, dreary days and rain, do try the Q-Link. It can change your life. You have nothing to lose since Amazon has a terrific return policy and everything to gain.Review by Annette M. Hall[...]"
1,"This is one of the best investments I have ever made. The Q-link works as claimed. I always take care of myself, keep in good shape, eat healthy, and in general keep myself healthy. So i figure this would aid to anything i would do but since I'm so healthy and in good shape i wouldn't feel much different. And it was so for the fist 3 days, after that I've increasingly started to feel with a lot more energy, its amazing how better focused i am. The interesting thing is, that after feeling like this is that i realized i was actually used to the little pains and to feel no so good in general (feelings like that became normal over time) and now is that i realize it because i feel so good now.Even if I have a few social drinks now, I don't get hangovers at all when i always did, and feel completely ok. My appetite has reduced and i feel its normal, I'm leaner and have lost a few pounds in less than a month, I dont need coffe in the morning anymore, im virtually stress free. In general, this is been a big plus in everything i do in my day life, even when im sleeping i sleep and rest so much better. It surpassed my expectations..."
1,It is so delicate & that's what I like. I have had so many comments on it.
1,"I bought this necklce not too long ago and was surprised to see it arrive so quickly. It is just as beautiful as it is portrayed and I love wearing it! The shipping frightened me a little, though, seeing as there were only two cushon bags and the necklace itself was poorly wrapped. But no damage was done, and I give it five stars!Laura"
1,I got this lovely necklace for my aunt for Xmas and she was delighted with it. I would recommend this seller to anyone! Thanks a million!
1,"These are so beautiful. They are good quality for a great price! Thanks, I love them!!"
0,"I was very unhappy when I opened the box and saw these earrings. They weren't what I thought I had ordered, isn't 3mm supposed to be small? I've ordered other earrings labeled '3mm' and these were not it.It wasn't worth it to return them; I would pay in shipping and re-stocking fees what I'd originally put into getting them. However, the earrings turned out to be something my mom liked, so it turned out okay."
1,"I had a daughter in September and wanted a practical ring to wear instead of my solitaire and too-small plain band. This ring is perfect! It's unusual and very feminine, and has my daughter's birthstone. Would make a great wedding band with a simple solitaire, or a nice right-hand ring."
1,"This rosary came in wonderful shape, and was just like it showed. The order's delivery came in very fast, which was amazing since it was a gift."
1,"i own this ring, would love it in different colors. am really please with it."
1,I cannot describe just how much I love this ring. It is the most beautiful ring that I have ever owned. The moissanite diamonds are just awesome and sparkle better than any diamond that I have ever owned. The ring itself is very substantial and suits the stones perfectly. Nothing cheap about this ring......If you think you like this style ring...by all means..do not hesitate to order this one....I can only rate this entire transaction 5 stars.......Even 6 if I could...VERY PLEASED.....:)
1,"Every Valentine's day since I have known my wife I have given her a charm that reflects some event from the previous year. I gave her this charm the year I proposed to her. When we bought our house I gave her a house charm and when we got married I gave her a wedding cake charm, etc. This was perfect for the occasion and is beautiful. I like the 3d charms and she is always pleased. Service was great and charms have always arrived on time."
1,Got this as a gift for my mom. She liked it very much. The color is rather unique and she loved them.
1,"This pendant exceeded all my expectations. The picture does not do this piece justice. It is so beautiful! It is beautifully faceted so it reflects a lot of light, silver, orange, yellow, blue, gold. I didn't have a problem with the back of the piece being treated, as some others mentioned. The piece is nicely weighted and centered and the pendant hangs from a single centered ring, so it does not tend to turn over when you move around. I think any woman who likes crystal would love this pendant. This would make a great Mother's Day gift or any occasion gift. Also, Gem Ave shipped my order promptly and I received it within a few days. I was very happy with the transaction and this exquisite piece of crystal."
1,"When I opened my package and saw this bracelet, I knew instantly that I had made the right decision to purchase it. I'm giving them as gifts to attendants for my winter wedding, and I couldn't be more satisfied. The picture really doesn't do it justice!"
1,"My purchase arrived in a very short space of time, it was packaged beautifully, and the necklace was stunning. Thank you"
1,When I saw this necklace I knew I had to get it for my sons girlfriend because it looked so much like her and her daughter. I really think that she will LOVE IT.
1,Someone asked for a Cameo for her Sweet 16. I seen this and knew that this is & was the perfest gift for her..
1,I simply love this necklace and pendant. It comes with a very nice case and a polisher. I highly recommend it!
1,I bought this charm as a gift for my niece for her italian charm bracelet. It is great as she loves monkeys
1,"The Jade in this ring was a lighter color than pictured on Amazon.com. However, I was impressed by the lighter Jade color. This is a well-made & stunning ring. I am delighted that I purchased it."
1,I gave this as a gift and it has withheld through some tough situations. It cleans easily and keeps looking new!
1,Beautiful ring. Fast delivery- I am very satisfied with this product and the delivery. I love 'Silver Insanity'!
1,"This pendant is a lovely sky blue, and the unique shape has attracted several compliments in just one wearing. It looks great on a silver chain. It's an inexpensive way to dress up an outfit in a fun way."
0,"I keep coming back to this bracelet to find a better description of what it is supposed to represent. Quoted Counting Birthdays Bracelet? What does that mean? What does it count? What did the designer mean? Does one select stones? Does one exchange stones as time goes on? Does one add to it as time goes on.I have been attracted to this bracelet for some reason, for well over a month at least, yet I can't figure out what I am seeing and what I would be buying if I got it. It may have been just the right gift for my niece this past November...may have been. May be perfect for anyone. If the whole idea was clear...I've kept it on my wish list...WISH I could learn if it should be on my shopping list.m.wall, smile"
1,"So, at first i was a little apprehensive about spending so much on a nose ring. I am so glad I made this purchase. I have extremely sensitive skin, always have. my nose piercing wasn't healing up like i wanted it to. I'll be honest it didn't look good, I was convinced that it was the nose ring. It was surgical steel, which is fine for most people. I could feel the difference a couple days after changing to this one. There are a lot of gold nose rings but not that many quality nickel free nose rings. love it, thanks!"
0,I don't think this chain was even sterling silver. I was so embarassed when I gave it to my aunt as a gift with a s.s. cross on it. The cross stayed silver but the chain turned black! Never again will I spend a dime with this vendor! And I bought 2 of them!
0,"Although I like the design of this necklace, I found that the quality of sterling silver is very poor."
1,Pendant was what I expected. It is lovely. The price was right and it was shipped on time and arrived in a timely manner5.
1,Incredible pendant! I had no idea it would be so beautiful. It's heavier than we thought too. Makes it feel far more expensive than it is.
1,May She spread her wings and draw us to the pinacle of sky's beauty. I really think that this pendant reveals the generous aspect of Isis.
1,I really like the way this charm looks. The price was definitely right. The shipping was very quick. I would purchase from this seller again. Thank you.
1,"The bees are incredibly detailed--you can see their little eyeballs! Shipped insanely quickly, and they're even in a pretty bag for the gift-wrap challenged. Every vein in the wings is meticulously made! The stones attract light in a way the picture can't convey. They are extremely delicate-looking, but pleasingly solid in your hand. Far beyond my hopes and probably going to wow the recipient. I'll be re-visiting this seller for more shiny things. Buy them! She'll love them!"
1,"nice size, they were bigger than i thought they were. the garnets are a very nice size!!!. the decorations are very beautiful!!"
0,This is a cute belly chain but its the only one I could find that would really fit me. I don't really like the fact that the design part goes to the back it will take some getting use to.
1,This ring guard is gorgeous! I had to have it adkusted as the width of my ring was too wide. My jeweler was able to make it fit beauticully. I lost one of the stones riding on the trolley in Sam Francisco and I have written the company to see if I could get it replaced there or purchace a replacement diamond.14K Yellow Gold 3/8 ct.

1,this braclet is gorgeous...i have the original one...christs story beaded braclet and only paid 15.00 for it...this item is priced way to high...i would look further before purchasing this one...
1,The extenders were as described. I'm very pleased with them and the delivery was quick.
0,"I ordered this because it was in gold and silver tone, it came today in silver tone only. I have 2 of each size in silver tone."
1,I had shorter than usual necklaces and these extenders were just what I needed. Now I can wear my necklaces without choking.
1,"I cannot tell you the number of times I had the perfect outfit and knew I had the perfect piece of jewelry to go with it, only to find that the necklace was too short to hang the way I wanted with the blouse I wanted to wear. That is one of the reasons these things are so great. It has also expanded my choices in jewelry because now I can purchase someting I think is a little too short without any worry - I can make it any length I want!"
1,My order was recieved very fast and the merchandise was packaged very nice.The chains were exactly as I expected from the picture presented on-line. I'm very pleased.
0,..the clasp will not budge on one of the extenders...its the longer gold one hoping i wont need it..wish seller would had made sure all pieces where working before shipped.shipping was quick though.
1,I like necklaces long enough to slip over the head without opening. This is my answer to the problem. In three different sizes there is one to fit almost any size necklace.
1,It did exactly what I wanted. Several necklaces are now at a better length.
1,"I ordered this strand of pearls as a gift and WOW!...I was so impressed (wish it was a gift for myself). Authentic looking, great luster and color. It is simply GORGEOUS, very worth the money, sure to please. Don't hesitate on this one, Very highly recommended A+"
0,"I purchased 2 different types of polishing cloths.One I could test because I got the delivery. The product does not last very long; it works very well for 3 o 4 polishings.The other polishing cloth which I should have received from Something Silver, did not arrive because UPS had problems on the way. TO my understanding SS did not handle the problem as I would have expected."
1,"I have had this belly ring for a long time now and it has lasted all this time. It is still my favourite one, because it is still beautiful. Very good price for it."
1,"Good quality navel jewelry, and it looks great on. I would buy it in different colors, if they were available."
1,I really like these earrings. The glass bead was bigger than in the photo. These are great high quality earrings.
1,"I also got this on a sale. really nice piece. well worth the price.Get it, you will love it, thats if it ever comes back in stock."
1,"This pendant is absolutely gorgeous, and I got it free in a special promotion at this web site"
1,"It's hard to believe a crab could be so cute, but this one definitely is. Wore it the same day I received it and got some compliments. A little bit heavier than some of my other charms, but with a stronger necklace (box chain is my preference) it shouldn't be a problem. I wanted a crab necklace and chose this one because of the way the claws were positioned. They looked like they wouldn't catch on any clothing because the top ones are attached and the bottom two are curved inwards. I think the tiny eyes on top make it look a little more comical. Hopefully on a day when I'm feeling crabby (poor pun:) this will cheer me up. Overall, great charm!"
1,I Ordered this anklet for myself because I love butterflies and when I received it Iwas in love thanks!!!!!!
1,I bought these for myself to wear during the winter. I was very happy with them. They are very light weight. I would recommend them to anyone. They looked much prettier when I received them ! Very happy about the purchase. Great service... Judy
0,"I bought this heart shaped pendant with a chain for a Valentine's Day gift for one of my daughters who attends college out of town. I thought it would be something she could keep as a remembrance, rather than the usual card and stuffed animal. Well when I finally saw it in person, I was appalled at how small and insignificant it was. It also has a somewhat ""plastic"" quality to it. If you want to buy something as a memorable gift, don't buy this!"
1,"I purchased these for a birthday gift. The recipient was very happy. The pearls were simply beautiful. In fact, she wore them the next day to church. No one could ever tell that I had purchased them as a gold box item for a mere $20.00. What a deal! :)"
1,Nice. They are a little large -- but really nice and I recommend them and I received a lot of complements of there beauty.
1,"These are well made - heavy enough to reflect good quality, not too heavy to be comfortable wearing. Nice polished silver"
1,"I ordered this ring to replace my old one. This ring came quick and is beautiful. My husband saw the ring & wanted one for himself, so I ordered him one too. This ring is very comfortable to wear & it really sparkles! Also, it is really worth the money."
0,"This necklace arrived broken, but I did not have time to return it for a new one (it was for a Halloween costume). It served it's purpose, but definitely is not a well made product."
1,"I bought the bracelet, earrings and necklace together. They are beautiful! I have received so many compliments. The pictures do not do the jewelry justice."
1,Received this lovely bracelet along with matching earrings and love them. They sparkle alot and outside the colors are brillant! Every color of the rainbow and then some. I get complements each time I wear this beautiful jewery and it simply makes me feel pretty. My niece will be given a set in the blue and lavender hues for her bithday. I am sure she will be as overjoyed as I was.
1,"I have ordered bracelets before but was so amazed at the quality and sparkle of this beautiful, reasonable priced bracelet. I would recommend this purchase to anyone who loves crystals!"
1,"This is a very colorful bracelet. The colors blend so well, and it looks very nice. My wife gets plenty of compliments when she wears it."
0,"I was stunned to see how cheaply made this product was. very light weight, almost has a plastic feel to it, no sparkle in the silver or gem, and I could easily bend the earring using little force. In all honestly, it looks straight from a 25 cent machine. Buyer Definitely beware. i returned immediately"
1,"I bought these earrings last year for a friend on the East Coast, so I haven't seen them yet. The colorful blue topaz stones first caught my eye, and I think the Celtic knot pattern and ""dangly"" style of the setting enhances their attractiveness.My friend is of Irish heritage, so I felt this pattern would make them more special to her. I became curious about that knot so Googled it to learn more. In case you don't know, Celtic knots are an Irish symbol you'll find everywhere in Ireland from designer jewelery to tattoos worn by rock n' rollers to, of course, the original Book of Kells back in old Dublin. It's not clear that Celtic knot drawings were ever meant to symbolize anything, but lots of modern people think they contain spiritual concepts. The knots are incredibly popular with followers of new age religions, magic societies and all sorts of other groups who want to draw an association with the oldest traditions of Ireland,That said, my friend's husband told me he likes them because they look so good on her and make her blue eyes look even bluer. Isn't that sweet? But most important, my friend loves them...and that's good enough for me!Highly recommended...and the price is right too.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 4, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books"
1,"These are very very nice earrings and especially for the price. I am always asked where did you get those and folks cannot believe the cost. They are light weight,but not cheap."
0,I love the earrings but one of my stones is noticeably smaller than the other. I don't wear them much because of it. Wish I could buy one earring in hopes of matching a pair.
1,"These Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Blue Topaz Hook Earrings are light, shiny, beautiful and look much more costly than they are. I was really amazed by the quality, and would proudly give them as a gift to any friend.They look great with jeans, but equally nice for dressier wear. They are quite a bargain, and I'm certain I'll wear them again and again."
1,"I got my order very quickly, so thank you for the speedy shipping and thank you for the gorgeous earrings. I wear them a lot, since they match so many of my clothes.--Beth :)"
1,Your product was on target and i liked them. They made an excellent gift. Thought they were bigger.
0,The earings are ver nice. The only negative is that i got 2 sets and they came in the same jewlery bag. They were for 2 different people so i had to buy a bag to put the second pair.
1,"They're really beautiful. The stones are a lovely shade of blue--not the washed-out non-color of so many inexpensive earrings. I love wearing them and as the title says, I always get compliments on them."
1,My husband purchased these to match a necklace. They are lovely and arrived on time...made a terrific Christmas gift.
1,"Just received these earrings and I have to say they are really gorgeous-the design is very graceful and balanced. Being petite I usually have problems finding just the right size for my face, but these are perfect! I love the high polish of the silver and the blue is deeper and richer than in the photo."
1,These earrings are very pretty and good quality. The topaz is clear and the silver is smooth and without flaws. The earrings are light wieght and do not hurt even when worn all day.
1,Thanks for such lovely workmanship. Great description and fast service. These earrings are a joy to wear and something I can pass on to my granddaughter. I love shopping at Amazon.com because I can do it with confidence that the product will be quality and the service exceptional.
1,"I gave these as a gift to my sister and she wears them all the time. Everytime she wears them, she receives compliments."
1,"My mom loved these. Good service, took a little while for the product to arrive. But they were in excellent condition. AAAA+++++"
1,I bought these as a gift for v-day for my wife. She loved them and they look great on her. I would recommend them to everyone.
1,I bought these for my son's GodMother and she absolutely LOVED them! They were much prettier than I expected and the price was an absolute steal!
1,"I bought the earrings beecause I liked the other comments, but was wowed by the quality, my friend enjoyed them. She thought I had paid a lot more for them."
0,i liked them but they were not what i thought i was going to get. very cheap looking
1,"I decided to purchase these based on the rave reviews... and I am so happy that I did! They are larger than I normally wear for earrings, but they are so pretty and look really good on me, they've quickly become one of my favorite pairs, I wear them all the time! They are exactly as pictured. I will probably order the same in Amethyst at some point. I got the matching ring and they are a perfect pair. I definitely recommend these earrings."
0,"The stoned in these earrings are beautiful and the design is very nice, but I would have liked them to have more substace as well. They seem somehow not enough. I won't be ordering the purple earrigns even though I love the color."
1,"The 8"" silver braclet is better than I expected. I should not be surprised as this company has always provided the best products I have ever ordered."
1,Beautiful charm. A nice memento to remind me of the offices we once had at WTC.
1,I love it! I was a little leery about purchasing a toe ring online; as in person I often get the cheap ones that break after a day or turn your toe green. This one is quality and durable! And thats coming fromsomeone who stubs her toes - a lot! It came quickly. It was in adorable packaging. I haven't taken it off!
1,A real Silver Forrest treasure....please keep these lovely earrings in stock for everyone. They are so artistic and not overwhelming to wear.
1,"I shopped around for months trying to find the perfect diamond wedding band. I settled on this one because the width of the band was just right and the price was good. I was worried that the price was ""too good""... until I had my ring appraised at my local jewelry store. It appraised at $2500.00 and that says it all!"
1,"My daughter graduated from college so as a gift, I bought this beautiful ring for her. She loved it and so do I!!"
0,"The picture looks better than the product. There are only 5 sides. The sides are not even square, being about 4mm x 5mm. On regulation dice, the sum of opposite sides is supposed to be ""7"", but the 5 is opposite the 3 and the 4 is opposite the 2. The 6 is opposite nothing, as the ""1"" side is open. The presentation was very nice, a velvet drawstring bag within a gift box. With the cost of gold being what it is, this probably the best they can do for the price. Maybe you should buy a magnifier to go with it."
1,"Love, Love, Love these. Planning on buying same earring in other colors later!Have friends interested as well and so I passed on where I got them!"
0,they are good but the real color looks nothing like the picture its a clear gray so if you want them because they are dark dont buy them
1,"My eighteen year old daughter is an interior qualified firefighter for our town's volunteer department. When she completed her Firefighter 1 training, I wanted to give her a Maltese cross. The majority are masculine. This is a very high quality white gold charm. You must see it to believe how truly beautiful it is, looks very expensive. Heavy weight in hand."
1,Nice earrings to go with the matching swarovski pendent. Look great both day and evening. A lot of sparkle with out the cost of real diamonds.
1,I love the sparkle of these earrings. The crystal is very good at picking up colors that are nearby and reflecting it into ever-changing glitter. They go with everything and stay put thanks to the leverback. You can't beat the price either. Definitely a great gift idea. Amy
1,Absolutely gorgeous earrings. I get compliments almost daily about them. Have even had a few people order a pair for themselves. I would recommend the earrings to anyone.
0,The process time for the order for these earrings was great- received them within 4 days. I was rather disappointed by the color- it was not as pictured and did not go with the other pieces I ordered to wear with them. They actually are yellow.
1,"The item is gorgeous. yes, they are delicate but usually the more beautiful something the more delicate. Sturdy enough, but simply gorgeous"
0,"Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin! I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial. They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice. The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint. Not what I expected."
1,"I liked the Crystal Earrings first because of the Leverbacks. Second, they were beautiful.. so beautiful I bought two more pair."
1,"These earrings are beautiful...lots of sparkle and different colors, so they go with any outfit...casual or dressy. The leverbacks are very comfortable to wear and the earrings are light as feathers, and the perfect size. The way the crystals catch the light is what I like best. When I first opened the box, I gasped with delight because they are so much more gorgeous in person. I am thrilled with this purchase!!"
0,I was a little disappointed in the size and shape of the earrings. They are more flat than round. And I thought they would be heavier. But I'll wear them anyway.
1,Was very pleased with the earrings. They came very quickly and looked great -- just as expected based on the pictures.
1,I bought this as a gift. The order came quickly and in nice packaging. The product was beautiful and a deal!
1,Wish it was more blue than yellow but it still looks like nice crystal. I liked the price but I reluctantly paid postage
0,"These have a lot of sparke to them, however, they are not the color that they appear on the page. They are yellowish and I was very unhappy about that. I contacted the seller and they made a nice offer to remedy the problem. They are pretty though if you have something in that color palette to wear."
1,"These earrings are quite nice, they aren't too big, they aren't gaudy looking, they have a lot of fire, and the sterling silver leverbacks mean that they won't corrode on some ears. The backs of the earrings aren't painted, if you look a little closer you'll notice that they have a kind of matte finish on the back which help to reflect light, making more sparkle. Also, these earrings reflect the colors that shine on it, meaning that inside, if you wear them in rooms lit with incandescent light, they will mostly reflect the yellow light that signs on them, if you wear them in sunshine or white light, they'll reflect all colors of light."
1,"The earrings are beautiful! I like the quality of the earrings and the sparkle. They are lightweight, which I like and the delivery was extremely good!"
1,"These earrings are so beautiful. When I opened the box, the sparkle jumped out to me. I literally said ""OH YES!!!!"" I work in a uniform that is all black and wanted something to stand out from that - well this is IT!!!!Don't pass up these up.Maggie - Racine, WI"
1,These were more then I hoped for. Just absolutely beautiful. They were a gift and my daughter loves them. Very nice quality.
1,These earrings are prettier in person! They really capture the light and different shades. You can wear them to dress up an outfit or everyday. I have received numerous compliments on them. I love them!
1,My daughter had lost a pair of earring that appeared to look like these in the picture. They were perfect and well made. The price was good.
0,"The earrings looked so pretty in the picture. In real life, they look cheap. They look like plastic, not like crystal. Very disappointed."
1,"I was a little disappointed on how smal the crystals are. They almost fell like they are plastic. More yellow than I like, picture showed more blue."
0,It had a yellow tint to it that I wasn't expecting. Also looks a little cheap. Probably won't wear it much.
1,love the color and shape and they are easy to put on and look lovely like them very much glad i got them
1,"These earrings are the most lovely earrings I have seen in a long time. They are fine quality and glitter and shine! The hooks are nice as well. Not too thin, not too thick. Just perfect. The clear go with everything. I LOVE them! I am looking into another pair in another color....maybe blue! Buy them! You'll love them!"
1,"This bracelet was purchased for my sisters birthday. She loves bangles, and has a small wrist. The only thing, the bracelet does not state what size it is but I took a chance and it is a 7"". It just fits me so I know it will fit her. Not only that, it has an ""S"" clasp which means it can be enlarged simply by adding an extra round circular link or two. In addition, it is a real ""sparkler"" and is very delicate looking. This bracelet is designed for a smaller wrist; under 7"" for a nice fit. It is truly stunning, and unbelievable quality for the price."
1,The diamond cut on this ring really sparkles. There is a substantial amount of silver on this ring but is still easy to adjust in small increments. great deal for a quality item.
1,"This bracelet is very pretty. It is large, but not overpowering. It is very durable and appropriate for many types of occasions. I highly recommend this if you are fond of the box link look."
1,i really like this ring. the cz is excellent quality and really sparkles. it is quite a good size too. a real bargain. you will love it.
1,"Due to troubling finances, I had to sell my engagement and wedding rings last Spring. My hand felt naked after 30 years, and I was very depressed. While fantasy shopping on Amazon, I came across this ring and seeing the price, thought ""what the heck!?"" I also ordered a 4mm plain silver band from the same vendor for a total of less than $18.00. The rings arrived as promised, and look really nice. I love the band on the solitaire, and while the stone is not real, you have to get up close to see that.Thank you, Gem Avenue, for putting a smile back on my face! :)"
1,"I received this ring just before New Years Eve, and have already gotten so many compliments on it. It is prettier than I expected and looks so real. I am very happy with this seller and will use them again in the future. I would highly recommend Gem Avenue to anyone, and recommend the purchase of this ring. Thanks so much for the prompt delivery. Thanks for the quality product."
1,"This pendant was beautiful when I got it, and it was even more beautiful when I gave it to my mom as a present and had her put it on.I'm glad I got this pendant. The only problem I had with it was that the chain was tangled when I received it in the box, but it only took me about 10 minutes to untangle it, so it's no big deal."
1,Hard to beat what u get for the price.Had same problem as many reviewers were the chain came tangled but after 30 mins of untangling it is indeed beautiful and my girl loved it I recommend it for any female lover of pearls.
1,"My mother loved this gift, as she has a fifth wheel that they travel in now!"
1,"It came right on time, exactly how it was described and my mom loved it! Thank You!!"
1,"I ordered the Pendent on Friday, it arrived one day after. The black pearl is in good quality and the chain looks gorgeous. At first, I thought I received a Sterling Silver chain because I didn't see '14K' on the ring of the chain. So I wrote an e-mail to the customer service, they replied my e-mail promptly saying "" 14K Gold"
1,I saw this and I really liked it. I bought it for my wife and she loved it. It looks very expensive in reality.
1,i bought this item for my Girlfriend for Christmas and she just loved it! And she has'nt taken it off since it looks good!
1,I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. She wears it every day and has gotten many compliments on it. It is a perfect size and was really good quality. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Makes a great gift.
0,A bit of a letdown. The pendant is only the size of a dime and the chain is quite thin. The stones are nowhere near the same color intensity as the photo wants you to believe. I'm curious as to the cost of the lens used to take the product photo. The necklace came in a small ziplock bag and I spent 20 minutes untangling it and the clasp isn't something I'm confident in. I am tempted to return it
1,"I was very pleased with this pendant. Similar ones were priced 50 dollars more, same designer and company. So i was very happy to get the exact quality and beauty for a few dollars less. saving a few bucks adds up in this economy. Thank you for the speedy delivery. I am very happy"
1,"I bought it as a gift for my wife, she likes it very much. The design is perfect!But as my opinion is concerned, maybe I am a layman. I think this pendant is a little light, the gold circle is hollow, I don't know whether is the character of this format, or the manufacturer want to save golden."
1,This necklace is awesome. The gold was perfect with no problems. All 3 stones were a good size and very very clear.
0,"Looks great in the pictures but not when you get it. Aside from the flimsy cheap chain that everyone is complaining about, the pendant is complete crap. It looks like it was stamped out of sheet metal and the back is completely hollow and greyish black. Looks like crap when it gets turned over. My girlfriend pretended to like it, threw out the box and hasn't worn it since Christmas. 55 days and counting..."
1,Great deal on such a nice necklace. Got it for my girlfriend for our anniversary and she loved it. Great buy!
0,"I received the earrings in a timely manner, but the clasps did not close and they were not good quality. Even the silver seemed low caliber."
1,"The ring looked exactly like the picture! In dim light the, diamonds look a little faded; but once the natural light floods over the ring it just ""pops"". The shipping was outstanding, the ring came a day earlier than expected. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great piece of jewelry on a budget."
1,My boyfriend bought this for me as a promise ring and it is absolutely beautiful. Its not to small and not to big. The two tone is very pretty. Its fits pretty true to size. I would recommend this ring for the money. It is definitely worth it.
1,This ring is lovely! The white and yellow gold make it perfect make for all jewelry pieces plus the diamonds sparkle with clarity. My son gave this to his girlfriend as a promise ring and she loved it! It is simple and elegant.
1,Wasnt sure how the ring would be but i was suprised. This is a great little ring for the price. I even had to exchange the size and amazon did it for free. Seriously...you cant go wrong. Money well spent.
1,"She love it and we engaged and this is a beautiful ring. However, size 7 is a little big for her finger and the nice Amazon return policy help me to return that one and then I ordered size 6. It's just perfect!"
1,"I asked my boyfriend to purchase this item for me last Christmas. He did, and I still never ever take it off. It is beautiful and I love it. Mine is exactly like the picture, was exactly what I wanted, and I have zero complaints. Love it."
1,"This Figaro was a gift for my son and he loves it. The bracelet is very large and heavy and looks great on a man's wrist. The packaging was incredible-an outside box, an inside box with lots of padding, plus a jewelry box inside that.The bracelet came inside a velvet pouch in the jewelry box.Amazon.com was very easy to order from and they sent a QUALITY product."
1,"Got it as a gift. It is very nice look, and size is right. I like it.Color is a bit lighter, which is also good - imho too vivid color makes it a bit plastic-like on the picture.There is only one ""but"" - a seller should also suggest a combo deal with a silver necklace for buyer's convenience."
1,"I just received my Reed & Barton Katherine Jewelry Box and it is beautiful, classy, high quality and has the perfect amount of storage. I am very pleased with the product and I am glad I ordered it."
1,"This is a gorgeous necklace! I bought it for my husband and he loves it. The necklace is a perfect size and fit. This shiny, sterling silver necklace is a great buy!! We are very pleased!"
1,My husband loves it!! the price is awsome! now i want to buy one for myself. the shipping was super fast. my Husband wares this chain everyday sents i got it for him. i will be buying more from this seller again.
0,"I've had this product for less than a year, it is not the best quality and has tarnished. The chain is microscopic and not worth $35. I would not recommend it."
1,I was looking for a necklace to fit a pendant that came with a ridiculously short chain (like who has a 15 inch neck!). This one was perfect. It looks great with the pendant (which was purchased elsewhere) and it is beautiful and well made. It looks great on its own too but I'll keep my eyes open for other fun things to wear it with.
1,This chain is beautiful and looks great with the cross pendant I bought the chain for. Great quality for a small price.
1,This chain is great and the detail is wonderful. I'm very happy with this product!
0,"Seems like the quality's fine, but I didn't realize it was only going to be like a millimeter thick. The picture makes it look thicker."
1,"Italian Diamond Cut Rhodium Overlay Sterling Silver Rope Chain (22"")I bought this necklace for my boyfriend so he can put a silver cross pendant on it. The necklace makes the pendant stand out its so beautiful. The diamond cut makes it look real expensive and brings out the cross..good deal!!!!I think a man or a woman could wear this necklace its so nice. He says it has a nice feel and a nice fit right at the 22"" mark for wearing it with a pendant. I will be buying another soon..Dahlia Jewelery is great!!!"
1,I wear a medallion around my neck for a Safety Alert System. I decided to add some decals to it - just to change the look of the thing. But then I wanted a chain. This is perfect. The medallion actually has &#34;class&#34; now and many seniors have asked me where I found such an attractive one!
0,"I recieved this chain on Wednesday, by Monday it was broken. It is a nice looking chain, but I was worried about the quality as soon as I took it out of the pouch it came in. Sending it back and looking for something different."
0,"I just wanted something strong to keep my 16GB ""Corsair Survivor"" USB around my neck.I decided to get this and I will use it because of the two chains I got here on Amazon this one seems to be less obvious and also seems to be very strong for its size. (I uploaded an image so that you could get an idea of its actual size)I dropped 1 star because it does pretty expensive. Looks more like a $20 - $25 chain.PS"
1,I purchased this after getting a Pewter Thor's Hammer Mjolnir Viking Norse Pendant on Leather Necklace. Unlike this fine product the feeble leather they sent it with was not strong enough to support the hammer of the gods. This necklace is also long enough to reach around my rather fat neck.
1,"Very nice product my wife loves it, very nice quality. It also looks very good on my wife when wearing it."
1,I love this bracelet. I bought it as a gift for myself. The coin charms are very cute. The bracelet size is good for us ladies who have average-sized wrists.
1,This is the most gorgeous bracelet of all time. IT makes an excellent bridal shower or baby shower gift.
1,"Often sterling silver cuff earrings are thin and flimsy sheets of sterling silver. These are a nice, quality weight without being overly burdensome on those ear lobes!These earrings are well worth the list price and if they are being sold for less, snatch them up! I bought four pairs for gifts and everyone has loved and adored them (and they thought I spent way more than I did!)"
1,"These earings are a super value. Very high quality sterling silver earing at a super price. As other reviewers have noted, they look great with both casual and evening wear. I have received numerous compliments on these earings and have considered buying several pairs as gifts as another reviewer has done. In short, you will not be disappointed with this purchase."
1,"The simulated pearls have a nice sheen to them. The rhinestones are red with no hint of orange or brown. Looks more expensive than it is. It fits loosely on my six inch wrist, so I'm guessing it's seven inches. 20mm or 3/4"" wide."
1,"On-line jewelry is often a leap of faith; this supplier has strengthened mine; color, quality, finish, all were much more than promised and even more than expected. I know I'll be back."
1,This bracelet is just as described. It is a beautiful piece that can be added to in the future.
0,I found the cut of this bracelet to make it look cheap/tacky.
1,"I get complments on these all the time. They are simple, yet have this nice touch of garnet. Very vintage. They dangle around 1.5"". You need different backs for them though because they come with the large plastic rimmed ones."
1,Beautiful earrings... Got them for my niece when she was here for Thanksgiving last year. She wore them right away. They are the color as in the picture. There is no difference that was seen.
1,"I am very pleased with this product. It arrived within the stated delivery interval, and is beautiful! And the Amazon price was several hundred dollars less than in local jewelry stores! Excellent!"
0,"The bracelet is beautiful, but the words are way to small. I bought this for a friend for his birthday, he had to get a magnifying glass to read the words. I also could not read the words properly."
1,"I bought these for my Sister-in-law for her birthday and had them shipped directly to her. She called me as soon as she received them, to let me know how much she loved them. I was hoping that they'd be nice, as I had only the picture to go by, and was thrilled to hear how happy that she was with them. I would definately suggest them to anyone."
1,"I am so please with Pugster! My order came fast and the brooches I ordered are stunning! I got the cross, a flower spray and a dragonfly and they are not only beautiful but very well made. I got mine to doll up a plain cloth purse and WOW! So worth the money and would make wonderful gifts. I would give 10 stars if I could."
1,"Very good attention, just in time shipping and delivering, nice presentation and envelopes, and specially"
0,"the ring its self is nice.but the thing that confuses is me is why these rings are sized 10 or 9 or lower. i got the biggest size to be safe (9 i think), and the stupid ring looked like it could barley fit a 5 year old. its as if they expect you to have skeleton sized fingers.theres no way the ring was a size nine if so then a size fize according to this ring is the radius of a pencil"
1,I ordered this for my Daughter. I was impressed that the pendant was of good size and weight. Though inexpensive this was not a cheap product
1,"For the price I paid, this ring is great... it's well defined and the crystal in it reflects well.. I will go back to the seller also, great cust. service. I'll would buy it again..."
0,"The eyepatch is cheap cardboard covered in black fabric. and the earing is not real durable either. I definately over paid for this product by purchasing it online then paying for shipping. That being said, it functions great just keep in mind the eyepatch isn't real durable and I don't see the earing be very durable either."
1,"I bought this item to my sister as agift,its look very nice and good size.it is in good condtion,she liked it."
1,I had purchased some tiny yellow diamond studs and this earring jacket set enhances those earrings.
1,"I love these earrings, they're cute, fun and I love horses and working in a daycare I can't wear dangly earrings so I am always looking for fun stud/post type earrings."
0,"These are super cute, but when my daughter wore them the back fell off and she lost one earing. She is really disappointed."
0,"The earrings are cute as could be, but the backs come off very easily. I expected something more secure considering they are children's earrings. Every time my daughter pulls her shirt over her head they both fall out & we spend 10 minutes looking for them on the floor. She only wears them now on special occasions instead of every day like she did at first."
1,"Purchased the adorable little earrings for my 7 year old. They look great, not too big for her little ears but big girl looking at the same time. She loves them and gets compliments on them all the time."
1,"I ordered this ring with some reservations- was worried that there would be scratches on the gem, however it arrived fast and in perfect condition. Its sparkly yet in a way understated at the same time. I get lots of compliments on it, and its very comfortable to wear."
1,"My choice with this ring certainly exceeded my expectations. It's a substantial stone and the ring feels extremely comfortable on my finger. I ordered my true size and it was perfect. I'm very happy with my decision, you will be too!!!! It's gorgeous!!!!"
1,This ring is beautiful!!! I purchased it for my daughter for her birthday. She loves it!!! It arrived on time. My daughter sits and stares at it to watch the colors dance as she moves her hand.
0,I like this product. It is beautiful when the sun catches it. It really reflects awesome colors onto surrounding objects. I had bought one similar that was real crystal but had a cheap band which discolored. This one is sterling silver so I knew discoloring would not be an issue. However this stone is of manmade material and scratched very easily and in months looked like the stone in my other ring which took four years of everyday wear to look like that. So if you don't wear daily or make sure you take off for unlady like jobs it's worth it.
1,This ring is a beautiful ring...any woman would love to have
1,I love his toe ring. It came in the mail today and I haven't taken the ring off. I only had the ring on for 2 hours before I recieved my first compliment. It is so comfortable. I don't even feel that I have it on.
1,"I love these earrings - they're beautiful on without being too big or too gaudy, and dress up or dress down easily. One of my most favorite pairs."
1,"i purchased these earrings for my mother-in-law...mother's day's coming up.i just received it in the mail, and i am seriously thinking about keeping them for myself. these earrings are beautiful. it definitely looks much nicer in person. it comes in a little blue pouch, enclosed in a little blue gift box, so it's ready for gifting."
1,"Unique prayer box design, nice pleasant weight to it, nice size. Chain is thin. Overall an inexpensive but unique & good quality piece to own or give, if you're looking for a prayer box pendant."
1,This goes great with your sassy attitude :) It fits my personality and just a fun thing to wear besides the same ol' same ol' belly rings available.
0,"The beads on this necklace are very small and lightweight; they feel like plastic beads rather than stones. The necklace is also very short, so in general it reminds me of a little girl's play jewelry. However, with the right look it is still cute - just don't expect high quality. I do like the color. Also an important note"
1,this stone is big and has another light blue stone and i get many compliments on this. Love it.
1,Another quality item and very pleased. Looks superb with the matching bracelet..will buy more and more from this company as the prices are so reasonable and the quality is awesome! :o)
0,was prettier on the site. It looks a little cheap and I got the matching bracelet and earrings. The earrings fell apart several times and i do not wear the set anymore
0,"I give two stars out of kindness. The cleaner does clean well, however, minutes after opening it and taking it out of the box, the plastic on the lid cracked. I've used it possibly 10 times now and every time the crack on the lid webbed out more and more. Today, on the 11th use, the lid broke off completely. Now, before accuse me of manhandling the machine in order to break it, you should know that I store it under the sink and gently lift it out from under the sink with each use (realizing how fragile it was with the first use). So now it's completely unusable."
1,I was nervous about these things because people have said that it can vibrate the diamonds/loose on a ring....but after using it I love it. I use it on my wedding band and engagement ring which has pave diamonds all the time and never had any problems. I would definately recommend this product!!!
1,Item was purchased as a gift for my wife. She is very happy with this product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive sonic cleaner.
1,"My husband added princess cut diamonds to my solitare and he was constantly having to take it to the jeweler's because I'm obsessive about the shininess. With this product, the only time I get it cleaned by the jeweler is when I take it in for them to check the prongs and stones."
0,"They were great while they lasted, but as another customer mentioned, the balls crack so easily. I would try to stick with all-metal barbells as well."
0,the jewelery is very nice but to small for my nipple..so far I can only where bars with decoration haning frm it
0,Bought a few of these belly button pieces and this one lasted one day. The dreamcatcher fell off somewhere before night fall. I still use the remaining piece.
1,I bought these as a birthday gift for a friend - they are very nice quality and she LOVED them! I would recommend.
1,"Such a beautiful piece of jewelry, the box that came with it was a nice touch to it. The picture of the item does not do it justice. It arrived on the earliest estimated delivered date. Would defentaly continue to buy from Silver Insanity."
1,"the picture doesnt do the pendant justice.. its simply beautiful.. my g/f loved it.. infact she wears it everywhere.. its a nice change from the constant hearts and beads and what not that stores only carry.. if your looking for a necklace that will stand out and looks great detail wise this is a wise choice.. its not to dark as the description makes it sounds.. and it comes in a neat little box that has a ""spell on the inside"".. great gift idea fellow guys who are wondering about buying..."
0,"I thought this would be much bigger and better made. To be honest, it kind of looks like it came out of a gumball machine. I would give this to a little kid, but never an adult. I kept it, but it is expensive for what you get. Looks cheap and not as nice as I had hoped."
1,"Fabulous and unique necklace! I love it and wear it all the time. As most of the other reviews stated, the chain is awful but I threw it away and kept the pendant. I put the pendant on a black silk cord and it is stunning."
1,"This jewelry box is great. It looks well and comes in a carefully packaged box with plenty of foam padding to avoid damage or scratches. The two side pieces for hanging necklaces offer plenty of room, as do the several drawers. For the price, it's a great gift for the significant other!"
1,These were just what I was looking for and at a great price.
0,"After recieving the wrong order I called customer service, they instructed me to ship the wrong package back and they would send the right one. It should have been a pre paid return label and I should not have had to pay shipment. That was not the case, after recieving the package back I called customer service again, yet again instructed me to send the wrong order back. Also told me if I didn't send it back in a reasonable amount of time they would charge me for the wrong order. Again I recieve the package back. All together I recieved the wrong package back 3 times and finally paid for shipment just so they wouldn't charge my credit card. After calling customer service they told me that they had given me all the discounts they could, I'm not sure what discount I got but I don't remember it!"
1,I wanted a ring for a January child and this was a successful choice. Nice weight and craftsmanship.
0,"I ordered this and was greatly disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!! What I got in no way resembled what is pictured here. I was also disappointed by how freaking huge they were. I have never woren them as my ears are not big enough, looking for an elephant with pierced ears to give them to!!!"
1,"I bought this for one of my closest friends. She and I both loved ""The Little Mermaid"" movie when we were children, and she's always had a fondness for mermaids since then. I was looking for a gift in honor of her having her first child recently, and came across this pendant. It's very pretty, and I feel it's a great gift for anyone who likes mermaids and has a child. Great detail and it has a good size loop on the back to accommodate many sizes of chains."
1,I bought this as a present to myself for the birth of our new (& first) baby girl. I will definitely cherish this piece for many years to come.
0,"The colors aren't as bold as in the picture, and it's actually more yellow and blue than green and blue."
0,When i bought this for my son i didnt know that it would be that huge and when he put it on it stayed black and never changed so please dont buy this you will be disappointed!!!!!
1,"I disagree with the negative comment. For $65 dollars, you know you aren't getting real jewels. I find the anklet to be beautiful and it sparkles in the light. I would order the 9.50 as there is an inch extender. With my tan, it simply glows!"
0,there is nothing real about this anklet. i bought it under the understanding it was real 14k gold i knew the diamonds would not be i did expect it to look so cheaply made looks like something you could get at walmart for a few bucks i am very disapointed i tired to email the seller and never heard back
1,This is my favorite navel ring! It's real cute and I get comments about it whenever I go out to the beach or the pool. However since this is made out of cheap material the color has now faded off the zipper portion. But that took 2months of everyday wear for that to happen and at this price I don't feel like that was unreasonable. Would definitely recommend!
1,"I really get attention from this belly button ring. Everyone questions the idea of it but always seem to smile, better then just your normal ball."
1,Pendant was just perfect -- just what my daughter wanted. It arrived quickly and we look forward to doing business with this company again!
1,"A great little necklace. The chain is quality, the oval small, (a little smaller than I'd imagined) but classy. Not at all cheap. Came quite knotted tangled, but that is apt to happen when shipped loose. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this piece! It goes with everything. :)"
1,"They look so much better online, they are basically tacky plastic buttons. They went back, of course Amazon was great with the return. Credit was processed fast without any issues."
0,"I chose 2 stars for my rating because I bought this to give to my sister as a gift and unfortunately it just feels too cheap to give it to her. I put it on myself and it is pretty - would be good for someone who likes bigger proportions/sizes in their jewelry (not particularly delicate). And I would recommend it to you if you think it is pretty, you need a silver every day kind of necklace and you are going to be wearing it yourself. Unfortunately, as a gift, it just comes across as a cheap necklace - when you hold it in your hand the medallion and the chain make a tin-like sound against each other and the under-side of the medallion is hollow and not smooth. Again, it is pretty when it is on and the quality can be kept as your little secret if you don't mind."
0,"I thought the bale was too simple, could have been better, too light weight for the pendant, should have been better."
1,Just received the necklace today and I am MORE than happy with it. It arrived quickly and the packaging is fantastic! It came in a little blue box and in a blue velvet bag...very niceThe necklace is good quaility and has a great shine to it. I might just have to order one for myself after xmas...this one is a present
1,My girlfriend will not take this off ;). Very nice sturdy quality with a decent chain. You will be happy with this item!
0,"I received this pendant today. The chain is nice and the lustre is decent, but there is one segment of the outer ring that is flat, not curved - so the circle looks like it has a big dent in it. This is so strange looking it is very distracting. Even though it was inexpensive, it looks so bad I think most people would rather receive nothing than this as a gift. I will be returning it."
1,Gifted to my girl friend who likes it very much. Great value for the price and design.
1,This was purchased as a gift and the recipient LOVED it. It is larger than it looks online. Makes a great gift!
1,The necklace is lovely. It arrived soon after purchase in a handsome velvet case. Quite a bargain.
1,"I bought this as a present for a friend, it looks exactly as shown in the picture and it is a beautiful necklace."
1,I got this for a friends birthday early in next year when I saw it personal picks for me. It is so delicate and smooth. The chain is like liquid. Just holding in your hand you can tell it is worth more than the selling price.It comes in a dark navy blue drawstring bag in a nice black cotton lined gift box. It is going to make a fantastic gift. It's so nice it's going to be hard to let it go but I will because it's just perfect for my friend.You will not be disappointed with this necklace.
1,"The pendant is beautiful. I get many complements on how striking it is. It is very delicate yet strong. The sterling silver is brilliant and the open design creates a simple and gorgeous pendant. Whatever color clothing I am wearing shows through the pendant, so it changes color according to what I wear. I like the slightly curved design so it's not totally flat against my skin. The butterfly design is not readily visible to all people. They think it is a flower, but I like that it is there and so large. I love it, and it's just what i wanted."
1,"Great product! Price was very reasonable and product came within a few days. I bought this for my daughters' for Eid, and they both loved it and now wear it everyday."
0,"I should have read all the reviews. The person that said this was perfect for a 6 month old was correct. The cross is EXTREMELY SMALL and the chain is really thin. I purchased this for a 10 year old, so I am returning it."
0,Terrible quality . Not worth USD 25 dollars. Probally worth about 2 dollars. Should be sold in a 99 cent store. What a rip-off. Amazon should perform a review of some of the vendors. I did not expect this.
0,"From the picture, I expected this charm to be a 3D miniature whale. Be warned that this charm is not 3D. Although it is cute, the back of the charm is open-- it is a flat charm, rather than a hollow 3D charm. I was disappointed by this, since many Rembrandt charms are tiny miniatures of the actual item."
1,I got these for my granddaughter for her 16th birthday along with the matching pendant. Small enough to be tasteful and large enough to be noticed.
0,"The ring arrived in a very nice American Pearl box with polishing cloth, velvet bag, and guarantee policy. Presentation was very good.The good"
1,"My item was shipped quickly and I love the earring tree, it's exactly what I wanted it to be. Good quality and good service."
1,"Got this for a young dragon fan. It's cute, she loves it, reports that the other kids at school say it's cool. Nice pendant, nice price. The only thing to note is that the design is only on one side, the back is flat. (also, I tried to order the red one, but they canceled the order telling me they were sold out... then 2 days later they had them again, which was irritating)"
0,"These earrings looked beautiful in photo, but when I received them in the mail, the chain was very thick. I expected a more delicate look, but could not return them because I opened the package and it was against the return policy. They are also not the same length. When I put them side by side, I noticed one pearl hangs lower than the other...probably not noticeable when you wear them, but it still bothered me."
1,I was very pleased with the bracelet and love to wear it. Would make great gifts for your loved ones. A card is enclosed with the bracelet that tells His Story. I would recommend this to friends and family. I don't believe you will be disappointed.
1,The picture doesn't do it justice. It's a beautiful pendant and great quality. I definitely recommend this for a cat lover.
1,Beautiful gift with space for a mini-sized photograph inside the locket. Value for your dollars.
1,Great value for the price. Well made with really nice color stones. Lots of sparkle and a nice size. Not to small and not to big.... Just right.
1,I wanted something different for my wedding band when I saw this ring I loved it .
1,I've been looking for a right hand ring for the one I lost recently. I looked a long time and when I saw this one I knew immediately that this was it. Like the other reviewers said it is a unique and beautiful ring. It looks very nice on my hand and I would recommender buying from this company.
1,"I bought this pin for my mom for mother's day. She loves hummingbirds and I was trying to find something special for her. When she opened it, she cried. She loved it! It was absolutely beautiful and looked even better that on the website. (That rarely happens!)"
1,"I was surprised when they were smaller than I thought they would be, but was actually glad about it because I was a little concerned they might be too heavy. They are the cutest earrings--very elegant--and I'm really very pleased with them."
1,"I bought this substantial sterling silver bracelet for my granddaughter who is eleven. It fits a small wrist so is very good for her size. The clasp, a beautiful rounded hook, can be squeezed to shrink the gap and help ensure the bracelet stays on. It is hard to find round rather than square byzantine chain. This bracelet is a rare find."
1,I received this for Christmas in the 7 inch size and love it. It is a nice heavy weight and is thick enough to not be dainty but not overwhelmingly chunky. I have handmade silver pieces from China and Thailand but this is much better quality. The bracelet has no flaws and clasps securely. This is definitely a must-have for an everyday item.
1,"i bought this for my husband for his birthday. i love he ,loves it. SCORE!!!"
1,How nice when you get more than you expected. I ordered two bracelets from GEM AVENUE and both are beautiful. I will definitely be ordering again! Excellent quality. You won't be disappointed.
1,"My bracelet is even more beautiful than the picture shows. It does not do it justice, seeing it online. The craftsmanship is awesome!!!"
1,"You can see the style of the necklace in the picture, so I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not it suits your tastes. Personally, I really like this choker and I feel it is simple and subtle enough for everyday wear, yet elegant enough for those times I feel like dressing up.The choker is very solidly constructed and is well made. It has a good, heavy feel, yet sits quite comfortably on my neck and never pinches me. I even fall asleep in it sometimes, and I do not worry about breaking it. The silver has not tarnished on me yet, and I've had it for about a year.All in all, I really like this necklace and feel it adds something different to my jewelry collection. I saw it a couple of years ago, decided not to buy it, and then regretted my decision when it became unavailable. When I saw it again much later, I bought it immediately and I'm glad I did!"
0,"I purchased this ring only to return it. It's a beautiful ring, but the quality is not very good. It says it is adjustable, but when I tried to tighten it, it sounded like it was cracking. I thought it would break in half. It felt like a plastic ring, rather than sterling silver."
1,"I had never thought that I can get a product like this at such a cheap price. That's until I found and ordered this product. Very nice for casual use. Moreover, the merchant also made me a good impression. I received the product several days before the expected delivery date. It arrived in a nice packaging and everything was as expected.A good bang for the buck!"
0,I didn't realize how thin it was. I just hope it doest break. this is not one I would recommend for charms
1,"Beautiful chain. Delicate, but strong. Clasp is not as tiny as the chain, so it is easy to open. I wear it with a simple gold cross pendant."
1,"My step daughter loves horses. I found this ring and bought it for her. she doesnt take it off at all, awesome purchase."
1,"Ok, other review got nit-picky about the term used, buffalo vs bison...I don't think that merits 2 stars being deducted. To write an actual review of the item itself"
0,"Although the product itself is good, I'm only rating it three stars due to the misrepresentation of the creature on the charm. The animal depicted is a bison (Latin name bison bison), not a buffalo."
0,i was expecting little more. not 100% satisfied. Not sure how stong it is. i dont want to test it anyway.
0,"The pendant is small, i am not sure if it is real sterling silver.....it looks weird. I am a little bit dissapointed"
1,This item was beautiful. I am getting married in March and we are using this as a gift for his daughter.
1,I got this for my niece for Christmas. I wanted to give her something special to keep until she gets older. Something that she would look back an cherish. SHe loved this necklace.
1,very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!
1,"This was exactly the quality they said, it arrived promptly and the image was fastened on beautifully. I love what i got"
1,I bought this bracelet for my niece. When it arrived I wanted to keep it for myself.The design and craftsmanship were beautiful. I loved that it was helping a small business in India.I'm glad I purchased this item and would do it again.
0,I just purchased the unit and followed the instructions to use it. All the steam just flows out of the top from the cap. I sent the manufacturer an email. Well see what happens next. Good luck to all new buyers.
0,"I got this for my ex-gilfriend, but it wasn't what she'd wanted. Apparently this device is only meant to be used after you've already washed your jewelry in one of those sonic cleaners. It gets the dirt of out of little cracks the sonic cleaner couldn't into. I think this is probably obvious to discerning women, but to any guys who just don't know, make sure to get your girl a sonic cleaner first if she doesn't already have one."
1,I bought the Jewel Jet for my wife and she absolutely loves it! Her jewelry looks better than ever. Thanks
0,This Product came in ok standards was not what I thought and the Chain was so short it would fit around a babys neck
1,"This is so cute and fun. I get alot of attention from it. When someone ask a question Im like ""Read My Tongue."""
1,My granddaughter loves this bracelet - I sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day.
1,I got this necklace about a year ago and it still looks just as beautiful today. And I wear it every day! I get compliments on it all the time and everyone asks what the story behind it is. I definitely recommend this item to anyone that's undecided.
1,I love my anchor necklace! What a great piece to start the summer off with. Everyone wants to know where I got it. Also- spectacular for the cheap price and it shipped out to me right away. Very pleased!
1,"I ordered this a while ago, and I love it, it is really nice, and a great gift for anyone"
1,"I bought a total of 5 of these, 4 for ear and one for eyebrow and they are EXCELLENT, love them."
1,I love my dangling chain hoop earrings. Most of my purchases with Amazon has been satisfactory and I am looking forward to continue my services.
1,this necklace is just great .. my brother ordered it .. n when it arrived .. all wt i wanted to do is to keep it for myself lol ..
1,"This beautifully detailed pendant is simply , to be perfectly honest, WAYYYYYY too BIG for my taste. MOST pendants of this type are about the size of a Nickel. ""Giant"" to me just did NOT compute to the GENEROUS size of this otherwise wonderful pendant. IF you like your Bling BIIIIGGGG, THIS reasonably Priced, pendant is perfect."
1,came in time and was loved by everyone. will consider you for future purchases. and will recomend your stuff to all
1,"I love Rottweilers, so this charm is perfect! Very good detail, easy to see. I'm very happy with this charm, and would recommend to anyone who loves Rotties!"
0,"I like the pendant piece, but the accompanying chain is so short you'd have to have a 5"" neck to wear it! When I bought this piece, the description didn't really mention the chain, so I was suspicious. When I rceived it, I saw that my suspicions were correct. The chain was so small that I seriously doubt that and adult could wear it as a ""choker"". It was a choker alright! Regarding the pendant piece, it is very pretty. Not too big and not too small! The stones are small, but delicate. All in all, I am somewhat pleased with this purchase. I have ordered a longer chain to put the pendant on. I wonder if that might have been deliberate by the seller. Hmmm."
1,"Theses was a great price for 2 ct tw 14ct gold black diamond earrings and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of earrings! You can pay this for Sterling Sliver but for this price your actually getting 14 kt gold! Great Deal and beautiful on, not to large or too small; just right and if you have a second piercing in your ear these would be perfect for that as well! I know when I got my earrings I was not disappointed at all, beautiful earrings that I know I will get alot of wear and enjoyment from."
0,"I was happy with the stone size, but the settings were rather chinzy. The backs are really small, and dig into your ear lobe, but once I put better backs on them, they were fine."
0,This diamond earrings are much smaller than I expected. I have white diamonds that are 1 cttw. and these are so much smaller. I have the 1/2 cttw. and they are almost the same size.
0,Did not like the Black Diamond Earrings. They are supposed to be 14K but did not look like it. Returned them.
0,"The earrings were shown to be a little larger than they really were, so in the future know what a carrot really looks like."
1,I bought this item for a birthday gift. It was hard for me to give them away :)
0,I am satisified with this product....ordered it with 2 others for Valentines day and this is the only product that made it
1,I gave them to my wife for Valentines day. She loved them. They were just as describe with beautiful black diamonds in a 14 ct setting. They were package well in a nice display box.
1,I bought the earrings from the Ligntning Deal for $129.99. It's a real bargain. The black diamond is shiny and has a good reflection. I love the earrings very much. The size is perfect for me. Please keep in mind that the black diamond has a small table top. Even the total weight is 2 ct the table top is much smaller than other diamonds.
1,"I knew that my wife looked at these earrings by the browsing history,so I thought I'd surprise her and order them for a gift. She was delighted,and they look very nice on her. (pat on back for me) I am not a jewelery expert,but I cannot see a thing wrong with them. They look very expensive,which they were not. Great deal on a beautiful pair of earings. I also upgraded shipping to 2nd day air. The earrings arrived at my door in 17hrs.from the time of ordering. AMAZING!! Thank you UPS and Amazon. I just might get lucky tonight."
0,"I have already sent these back to the seller. When I received these earrings, they looked like they had been scratched and along the prongs it looked as if there was glue, or maybe they were just really dirty. Either way I returned them within 10 minutes of receiving them. I later found out that Black Diamonds are just that way, unless you buy high quality, basically flaweless, this is what you can expect to see. With that said, these earrings were too flawed for me to give to my wife. I thought for the price it was a steal, but turned out to be too good to be true. On a positive there wasn't any hassle with returning these."
1,Bought these as a Christmas present for my wife. She loves them. They were as described and delivered very quickly. The black diamonds look great. Great value for the price.
0,"I was able to take advantage of a deep discounted sale on these. I knew not to expect much, but I've never seen a black diamond before, so I was intrigued.When I got the earrings, they looked ok (I plan to add some diamond jackets in the future), but way smaller than anticipated. I really don't think the ""1 cttw"" is accurate. 1/2 ct stones are larger than these. In any case, you do get what you pay for, and they seem to be a fair value at the price I paid. At full price, these babies would have taken a round trip!"
1,I ordered this for my girlfriend after GREAT disappointment in a pair at ZALES! This earring are stunning...clear...the perfect size and style. I recommend them for anyone looking for a great pair of black diamond earrings!
1,I bought two sets of stud earrings for my daughter on Amazon and this was the best. The earrings were larger than I thought and sparkling. They were very noticeable and looked great. The price was terrific.
1,"I was a bit apprehensive at first due to previous reviews but when I saw the earrings, I was VERY pleased. They were beautiful and had a wonderful sparkle to them. I was afraid they would be dull but you need not worry. They are beautiful and well worth the price."
1,My girlfriend loves them! I haven't seen them myself yet as I'm in Afghanistan but she said they are beautiful!
0,"The price was too good to be true. One of the earrings had a chip in it and the other had a cloudy stain on it. They also lacked brilliance and sparkle. I returned them, sorely disappointed."
1,Looks great with an every day outfit and was delivered very quickly. I was very satisfied.
0,i know a little about Egyption hieroglyphics and i know that the pendent says mother not mom. i know that some people r like so what it means the same thing but i feel that when u spend that much money on something u should at less have the right translation.so for anyone who is still reading this i will tell u about the symbols i know
1,"This engagement ring was an awesome choice. Beautifully put together, and it looks great when the sunlight strikes it. She was extremely happy about her perfect ring; that wonderful moment of smiling at one another was worth every penny."
1,"(11/30/2011)This ring is gorgeous!!! It is so delicate and classy..! I love it! I checked Blue Nile - the same ring is sold for over $500 over there.Honestly, the diamond turned out to be bigger than I expected, even though the ring itself is a little thinner... Anyway. I love it!!! LOOOVE!!!UPDATE (12/19/2011):Just today I noticed that the ""white gold"" started turning YELLOW on the side of the band opposite to the stone. Very upset. My wedding is tomorrow. If only I knew this would happen... I am so frustrated...UPDATE (1/18/2012)Sent the ring back (got the paid printable shipping label), got the refund - no problem at all >^..^ =3"
1,"everything seens to be nice and my gf loves the ring, the only thng missing was the Certificate of Authenticity, i took the ring to the jewelry store and an expert told me it was a true diamond :D"
1,This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top. Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it.This will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingPlus it's under 100. Can't beat the price. Thanks amazon!
0,This is a nice yet smaller than I expected diamond circle pend.
0,The picture of the pendent on Amazon looks much larger than the actual pendent. It is difficult to see the diamonds at all. I returned it.
1,Nice size and detail. Huge loop on back for necklace is plenty large for some paracord. Masculine but with class.
1,"Review from Andrew's wife, the SAHM book lover! - I love these earrings! They are a simple pearl earring - elegant and understated - but with that little swirl of white gold that makes them special and fun. My sister wore these earrings as her ""something borrowed"" for her wedding. I received them as a Christmas gift from my husband and they have been the best Christmas gift ever!The quality and luster of these pearls are fabulous. Buy these earrings!"
1,"This is the 4th item Ive purchased. I love them all. I have the pink crystal earrings, bracelet, and pendant. Now I have the green bracelet and Im sure I'll be getting the blue/purple one soon. They are easy to wear. Go with everything. Very durable and made well. I highly suggest this product line."
1,"Got them promptly,simple and stunning finish. Girlfriend loved them and plans to wear them till they 'wear out'. ;)"
1,Earrings came in a little felt envelope in a little jewelry box. Really pretty and my girlfriend loves them. A little larger and higher quality than I expected.
1,These earrings are lightweight (but sturdy). I think they are suitable for an adult or a child. Makes a great gift.
1,These earrings are absolutely beautiful. My wife wore them to work the first day and received many compliments. I would recommend them as a stunning gift for anyone!
1,"I bought these earring when they came up as a lightning deal for $14.99, which was a reasonable price. I certainly wouldn't pay full price (currently $34) for them though (they're not THAT pretty). LOLThey are very cute and ""spring-like"". They look delicate, but are quite sturdy. Amazon also sells two matching pendants that would go very well with these earrings. (The matching pendants have also come up as lightning deals)"
1,"Have had these for years now, don't tarnish easily, and shine up nicely with a polishing cloth. Great quality, will definately purchase from Peora in the future based on this purchase."
1,"I was worried my daughter in law might think it to be too new age, but she loved it."
1,This is an absolutely beautiful ring. The onyx is bright and the design is clear and pretty. I am very pleased also at its size.
1,"I love my ring. I get complimented on it daily. It's very vintage-inspired and chic. The only issue with the ring is it was advertised as adjustable, however it is most definitely not. My ring is welded together in the middle so I had to wear it on a different finger than planned because it was too big. Other than that, though, it is amazing!"
1,"Much shinier than the picture does justice, and the sheen lasts. I was worried looking at the picture and for the price it would look cheesy and plastic, but it's very nicely detailed in person."
1,awesome could be a little bigger because its more blasphamous if it bigger... i dont take it off for nuthin
1,This is a great product. The delivery was quick. Great to work withthis company!
1,I was very pleased with my order especially once I received it. They work as advertised and I've even shared them with a few of my friends and let them know where to purchase. I will definately use this vendor again.
1,"Was told about these went online and OMG! Just what I hve been looking for for about 40 years . No matter what I found that I thought would work, this earlit was exactly what you need if the earring hole in your ear is much to bib from surgery and wearing away of years of wearing earrings. Just love the product and will purchase again and again, I can now wear hoops after all these years. Thank you"
1,"Bought this earrings as a present for my mother, hope she will like them.i received order and was very impressed with quality and beauty of this little earrings. They even better than on the picture.want to order a pair of earrings from this seller for myself)))"
1,"from the moment I saw this I just needed to have it, it attracted me like a magnet I wear it on a long and heavy silver chain because the pendant itself is heavy and looks on its best when worn on a long chain. I've had a lot of compliments for it is such a unusual piece. I might already have a large collection of silver jewelry but this is one of my favorites. Silver Insanity has many beautiful pieces of jewelry so I guess I will buy some more in the future."
0,returned bigger than appeared to be not quite what i was looking for prompt return and refund
0,"hi folks,be carefull , it will come in a huge non-udjustable size. and all this gold thing its a rubbish i mean you barely can see that gold boltsgood luck!"
0,"After a few years of wear, the finish wore off and started to iritate my skin. To my knowledge solid titanium would not have done this. The description did not indicate that the necklace was plated. Simply, metal"
0,"I try to accustom myself to items not looking as impressive in reality as they do in advertisements. However, the titanium necklace was a total let-down. It is just a dull-looking little, and I mean Little, chain. Wish I hadn't fallen for it."
1,"Great bracelet, good quality, no need to bend a lot to get on and off. Always get compliments on this one."
1,"Excellent pewter motorcycle bracelet. High quality and attractive product that I wear regularly. Because it is pewter, care needs to be taken about not bending it too much."
1,This is my first piece of Black Hills Gold and I love it. I'll be adding more to my collection. The shipment was packaged well and came quickly. Definitely would recommend
1,"I own several Carolyn Forsman slide show bracelets. I love the themes of the bracelets and they are both classy and casual at the same time. One of my favorite bracelets was damaged, but after contacting Ms Forsman, she sent a replacement panel quickly. I highly recommend these bracelets as a gift for anyone who is fashionable/trendy or anyone who loves unique jewelry."
1,"This skull necklace was just what I have been looking for. loved it. The quality is top notch for such a small price, came with a jewlry bag and every thing, the adjustable leather chain was really great for creating different looks."
1,"I am a huge fan of skulls, and this is the best necklace I've ever worn, and I've had many skull necklaces. I never take this thing off, and I get compliments on it all the time. I ordered two extra in case I lose one or wear one out."
1,"I loved this ring, but unfortunately, it broke. It was a beautiful and inexpensive ring."
1,"If you want a piece of metal with stylized spiders on it wrapped around your wrist, this is the item for you. Perfectly good metal wrist spider thing. And so reasonably priced!"
1,"I've been very happy with every piece I have from Harris Michael, and I think this piece is gorgeous. I hope I get it for Christmas ;-)"
0,"I bought 16 of these since I knew they'd be weak and I'd need spare parts.The hinges will break instantly and you'll have to replace them. I suggest labrets or brads with solder. I really do mean instantly. The very first time you bend your finger, the hinges will pop. Be prepared.The tips are too sharp to get into most clubs so you'll need to dremel the tips.Pewter is so weak that a few scritches will bend the finger tip grips out so you'll have to bend them back. Doing this more than a few times will break the tip along the line of the beautiful pattern.For a $4 each costume piece (what I paid), they are fine for a little while. I feel very sorry for anyone who paid $30 for just one of these.I receive lots of complements on their beauty."
1,Amazingly beautiful is the only way I can describe these necklaces.They are hand crafted and the detail is amazing. I bought them for my girls as a gift and they won't take them off. I highly recommend them to anyone who apreciates fine jewelery.
1,I am so very pleased I received it before it was due to arrive and it was exactly what i ordered and I wear it all the time.
1,Exceeds expectations and I adore this ring! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it seems very durable for everyday wear.
0,I purchased this as a gift for someone. I liked it a lot myself and I would purchase another for myself ---if it had more weight so it would rest nice when worn. A black silk cord works great with this.
1,"I work for the sunflower industry so this ring was a perfect fit in more ways than one. It's a beautiful ring with great detail. It has a substantial band that's sturdy, but yet not too heavy. Great purchase!"
1,"Another animal-inspired design from this great Amazon vendor! The detail is fabulous--from the spiral around the ring, to the wolf heads, to the snake clasp, to the snake-skin links! Fits small to medium wrists, and is appropriate for men or women."
0,"I ordered 3 different styles of these inexpensive, silver, moon/star rings. They are cute, but they turned my finger greenish the first time i wore them. I never had this happen with Sterling, so i'm not sure what to feel about them. They're still cute rings."
1,"i was impressed with this ring. its small but sturdy. and it literally arrived 2 days after i purchased it online. very prompt which sometimes isnt the case, so that was nice. the ring intself is very cute and ive received many compliments."
1,I know my little sister will love this. It is wonderful. The ring is sturdy and the elephant seems well attached. It's small size will keep it out of the way while still looking great. I suggest this ring to any who like inexpensive well made jewelry.
1,This product came exactly as it was described. It was in excellent condition and was packaged nicely.Would buy it again.
0,"Good quality but, had the size been given in the description, I would not have ordered."
0,"These earrings are very pretty, but they are NOT orange as described. They are yellow. I was very disappointed when I got them because I had gotten them as a surprise for my daughter who wanted orange earrings, and these are definitely yellow not orange!"
1,"The ring is wonderful!!!!!!! It is a little heavier than I expected, but I'm extremely pleased it is. It is GORGEOUS!! I have gotten dozens of compliments in the short time I've had the ring."
0,"well,I received this ring and love it. However, it is not exactly like the one I thought it should be ~~~~However, it is fine I think~"
1,This is an unbeatable price on a platinum wedding band. I bought this for my husband 3 years ago and it still looks great. We looked at bands in several jewelry stores and this one looks just as nice as those and the style is more of what we were looking for. It is comfortable to wear and is a good solid weight for a men's ring. I would definitely recommend this item to someone looking for a platinum band. Of course I think it would be a good idea to try some on at a store to be sure of the size and width you want.
1,Very nice ring set. I definitely got my moneys worth and will be ordering again from evesaddiction. I received my package quickly and the customer service was great.
1,"I bought this ring for my fiance at the time and I gave it to him for Christmas, which was a few days before we got married. He absolutely loves the ring and wears it all the time! This ring is so cool because you can take out the cross part and leave it to show skin or keep the cross in and it is really beautiful detailing. My husband wears this ring everyday!"
1,"I am extremely satisfied with my ring. The price was good, the shipping was fast and inexpensive. The fit is great. I wear this ring daily for over a month now. My friends have even commented how they like it. I would purchase this ring again if something happened to it."
1,I really am pleased with the hummingbird charm. It really looks neat on my italian charm link bracelet!
1,This was exactly what I needed. This was a prize for child's fantasy football contest. The winner received this wonderful gift. This purchase made the children excited for the exact reason why I bought it. Thanks!
1,This necklace is absolutely beautiful and of superior quality. I bought it as a present and the recipient absolutely won't take it off. Great product!
1,"Superior service; prompt communication. Product excellent quality as advertised. Highly recommend this seller for your purchase needs, you will not be disappointed!!"
1,This bracelet is for a friend I am going on a trip with. She will have some other lavender jewelry and this will match very well. thank you so much.
1,"This is a lovely pendant. I wear mine every day (not in the shower). She has fine detail on her face, and the back is also detailed. Treat yourself!"
1,The ring is beautiful and I couldn't be happier! I will definately look on Amazon for my next ring because I can order in my size (9) and wear it from the day I get it instead of paying someone to resize it.
0,"This ring was cheap looking when I got it. It was packaged well and fit okay. It just looked cheap. The seller was awesome. They refunded my money without any questions or hassle. I will buy from this seller again, just not rings like this."
1,"I was thrilled to find such a lovely ring in my size, which is a 9. It fits perfectly and I love it!"
1,I received the bracelet in just a couple of days and it was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughter as a gift for her end of year drama play!!
0,"I simply wanted a pair of medium sized silver earrings. I was tired of purchasing the cheap ones from the kiosks or pharmacies which would lose their shape after a few wears. Once I received these I was even happier as the post slides into the hoop so you don't have to deal with clasps which won't catch or if they do catch, pinch your ear for that split second. Unfortunately, I believe the cheap ones would have been preferable. Note"
0,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who fortunately is petite with an Aubrey Hepburn-style neck. The chain is beautiful and sturdy, but is shorter than I expected (maybe I didn't read the fine print) and should rightfully be called a choker instead of a necklace. The heart is also smaller than it seems on the screen, but is a lovely stone. This product will look good on a child or a tiny adult."
1,This item is exactly as described. I received it super fast. It fits perfectly and this is someone I would definitely order from again.
1,This Claddagh is one of the most beautiful I have seen thank you for the prompt service too!
0,The picture of this product is misleading. The product delivered was cheap and gaudy looking.
1,These earrings are beautiful. They reflect the light and go with so many outfits. Pix do not do them justice.
1,"I bought this to use as a second set while my original wedding set was being repaired. This is a very nice set and it was comfortable to wear. I like that the set nested together so that the rings were not rubbing against each other. This is going to be a great set to take to the beach and other places that I don't want to risk damaging or loosing my original set. This set looked realistic on my hand, not fake."
1,I had been looking for an affordable ring to wear as a wedding ring because mine always catches on things. I looked at tons of rings and this one caught my eye right away. It is simple and elegant. You can't tell that it is not real diamonds unless you look real close. It is a great ring for a great price. It fits true to size and is flat enough on top that it doesn't snag my clothes. I love it.
1,I just recieved my ring. and love it. Great seller. fast service and shipping. Thanks so much
0,"I bought this ring for my wife so she could wear something in place of her wedding ring when she didn't want to damage her real one. First of all, the price of the ring is cheap, so I know that I can't complain too much, however, when I got the ring, it was for a Christmas stocking stuffer. The picture showed a nicely wrapped package with a bow. What I got was a tiny package that was wrapped so poorly with a generic computer printed label with no bow. I had to unwrap it to redo the wrapping, which was a good thing anyways because I wanted to check out the ring. The center diamond is very pretty, however, it is set crooked and looks like it is about to fall out. The side bands look much cheaper than the picture. I don't think the small amount of money that I spent on this ring was even worth it. The nice thing is that the center band can be removed and worn as a solitare. Not exactly what I was going for, but oh well. I will probably return this ring."
0,"OK, I read the review calling this a ""Rip Off"" and I agree that they are too expensive. But I was willing to pay the price (plus shipping) for 2 sets of what appeared to be beautiful cloisonne pill boxes to give as Christmas bridge gifts to my friends. I am now embarrassed to give them. They are not well made, they are heavy, and they do not open and close easily. I will not be carrying one in my purse, which is what I intended to do. It will probably be another useless trinket to my bridge friends. Maybe I can make it up to them next year."
0,The four leaf clover necklace goes very well with the matching earrings. It is a perfect yet simple set. Now I am waiting for it to bring me luck when I wear them!
1,They were a gift for my husband. He was very surprised and enjoys them. I am glad I got them for him.
1,I was very excited to receive this bracelet. IT was simply beautiful. I would love to buy another one as a gift. The picture does not do it justice.
1,The service was excellent and the quality of the jewelry was much better than expected. I have bought from this store several times before and never been disappointed.
1,just what I needed - now all my pierced earrings are easy to find - and are always in pairs!
1,I needed something to keep all my earrings in so I could see at a glance what I wanted. This is just perfect. It fits in my drawer perfectly.
1,"Oh my, what a treasure to find! I love my bracelets(2) 5 row, they look real, expensive and the plus is they are comfortable. I have a formal/black-tie/hollywood-red carpet type dinner Gala to go to June 18,2010 and these bracelets match my shoes, necklace/earrings which, are also in rhinestone; and of course the gown dress to a tee. I'll look like a million bucks! If you have been looking for a great fashion rhinestone bracelet look no farther, stop and buy I promise you will not regret it! You can also wear the bracelet with just about anything to dress it up even a white blouse and dark blue jeans. This is a Must have item for every women granteed.***Oh BTW:, shipping is fast! I order the bracelets one by acciedent, but I'm keeping the second one, May 28 or some where in that timeline and they came today, June 1, 2010 in the mist of a major holiday; Memorial day."
1,It is wonderful. I am sure that my husband will love it.
1,I got this for my wife. I orderd and it came pretty quick. She has had it for about 6 months and looks very nice.
1,"I ordered these lapel pins as gifts and they are so cute, but small enough to wear with anything. Plus, this company makes so many different styles and designs they're easy to personalize as stocking-stuffers or other types of gifts. My husband is a microbiologist and he loves his microscope lapel pin!"
0,"She really liked the pendant, the only problem is, the picture shows the stone to have more color that it actually does. The stone in the necklace I received was much paler than the one in the picture...I guess that's what I get for buying it online. Can't see exactly what you are going to get."
1,"SUCH A PRETTY THING,AND I HAD JUST HAD A SPAT WITH MY MATE AND WAS ON A GEM SITE SAYING CARNELIAN WAS GOOD FOR MARRIAGE-I SAID ""WHY NOT?""""-WELL THE BRACELET CAME IN 2 DAYS -SPAT WAS ALREADY OVER BUT I WORE THE BRACELET ANYWAY AND OH MY GOSH-I DONT THINK I""LL EVER TAKE IT OFF. THNXGUYS FOR A GREAT BRACELET."
1,"was searching carnelian due to reading about its ""magical"" properties. when I got this bracelet I was pleasantly surprised. it really is a cute little bracelet and the color mixes on the stones received a number of comments from friends. I really like this bracelet and wear it often."
1,Keeps my earrings sorted and easily available. This screen has a pretty substantial capacity but I'm sure I'll get another one eventually.
0,"This does what you need it to do. It holds your earrings. Unfortunately, I expected higher quality. Once I removed it from the box, it was already making this creaking noise as if it would literally fall apart in my hands. I new immediately that I had to be very delicate in handling this. I also do not like how close the holes are to each other. Ideal for studs, but for big nice earrings, they will take up space quickly. Overall, it gets the job done, but it probably won't last very long."
1,I am very pleased with this purchase. Easy to use and holds all of my earrings so that I can see them to pick which to wear. I used to keep them in a jewelry box and could never find the ones I wanted. Easy to hand earrings on...love this!
1,"My earrings were a tangled mess in my jewelry drawer until I came across this perfect earring organizer. It's so easy to use and folds to take up less space, but then unfolds and displays everything so you can pick out a nice pair to go with your outfit. I thought I would need 2 of these for all my earrings, but they have all fit perfectly on just one. So either I need more earrings..lol.. or I can give the other one as a gift."
1,"This earring holder does a super job helping to organize and display my earrings. It does not take up much room, and even looks rather decorative with all the shiny earrings dangling on it!"
1,I love this product. I have a lot of earrings and I have tried many different things over time like putting them in small clear plastic bags and keeping them in a box. The other box organizers are great for a few earrings but make it hard if you have many earrings. This looks nice and I can always find the color and style I want. If you have over 25-30 earrings this is a good buy.
1,I love earrings thats the only piece of jewlery I cant leave the house without. I had been looking for an earring tree for a while that would fit all my earrings and this is it.
1,"I am thrilled with the Folding Earring Screen. It looks very good on my dresser, and it holds all of my earrings."
1,I had three small earring holders and it took up too much space. This one is great. Holds all my earrings and folds up into a small area.
1,The simple design of this item makes for quite a show of my earrings. All of them are now at my fingertips and I no longer have to sort through four jewelry cases to look for earrings to match my outfit. The clear acrylic makes it look very modern and clean. This would make a wonderful gift!
1,"my wife was looking for a certain kind of holder. One like the one she already had. After checking several department & jewelry stores I sugggested that we try Amazon. Sure enough, there was a holder just like the one she already had. After reading the reviews & the comments about the bottom tier being basically useless, we decided to get two. Problem solved! She loves them & they are even prettier than her old one. Good work Amazon, you're the best!"
1,This is the 2nd one that I've bought now. They are extremely great value for the price!! Holds lots of earring. Doesn't take up much space.
1,"I purchased this screen to replace a smaller acrylic earring holder I'd had for many years. Other than the shape (the old one was a butterfly, this one's a ""boring"" rectangle :-) this one is superior. It holds about twice as many earrings, and can hold post-style, french hook and loop earrings. It's big enough that I use it for my most-used necklaces as well."
1,"I love this acrylic earring holder. It is very practical and convenient. Allows me to easily store my earrings and find them at a glance without having to go through multiple drawers of a jewelry box. I had two of them for several years and have now expanded to 4. Because they fold up so easily, i am able to keep them side-by-side on my dresser with minimal use of space, opening them only when I am removing or replacing earrings.Acrylic Plastic Foldable Earring Screens"
1,I was pleased with how quickly the screen arrived. It fits perfectly on the shelf in my linen closet that I have designated for my jewelery. Now I can see my earrings and I don't just put a pair in and wear them for weeks on end. It makes it so much easier and now I know what I have instead of waisting time hunting for what I think I have!!!!
1,"This earring holder has greatly organized my life. I used to use drawstring bags for my earrings which worked for a while. As my collection grew, the drawstring bags didn't cut it anymore. The folding holder fits around 180 pairs of pierced earrings and is easy to fold up and carry without dropping any earrings off. It does not work well for holding post type earrings if you use the small metal type clasps on the back. But if you get those ones with the plastic ring, it works fine and the plastic ring type also helps flabby earlobes hold the posts better :-)"
0,"This is the most ridiculous earring holder on the market. I bought a two-screen holder many years ago and love it, but I've since acquired many more pairs of earrings and need more storage space. I looked on the internet and in stores for months before buying this product. But what a disappointment! The bottom set of holes on each row is too high to accommodate any earrings except posts. Notice in the photo that even the earrings shown don't seem to fit right.So just when I was about to toss the thing, my engineer husband asked what would be needed to make the product work best. I said that the holes needed to be placed on the lower edge of the row so all earring could dangle. So he drilled new holes! Now the product is perfect.If you don't have a drill or a handy friend, don't buy this poorly designed product. Keep looking."
1,"I was using plastic fishing tackle boxes to store my earrings, until I saw this product for sale. I bought the acrylic foldable earring holder and I love it! I can see all of my earrings at a glance, instead of looking through 4 tackle boxes, to find the pair of earrings I want to wear at any time. And it holds a lot of pairs of earrings. If I buy more earrings I will definately buy another holder."
1,This was the only earring holder I could find that could accommodate my large collection of earrings. I don't know why there have been complaints of not being able to hang earrings with french hooks. Mine fit perfectly. Another thing I love about this earring holder is that even after I hang up all my earrings (including some pretty large hoops) I can still fold the whole thing up. This makes it a great space saver as well as a great way to transport my earrings.
1,Perfect earring holder! Makes finding the exact pair of earring I want easy and accesible! Shipping was fast!
1,"My daughter and I have well over 150 pair of earrings. We never wore most of them because we not only didn't know what we had but couldn't find the mate most of the time. Using the screen, which can be either spread out to show all the pairs or folded to take up only a small space has made it possible to wear earrings I'd forgotten I had."
1,Needed to organize my earrings & this screen is more than I will ever need. I cant imagine having enough earrings to fill this. Very sturdy. Holds post earrings neatly. I store this folded standing upright in a medicine cabinet. Very satisfied.
1,"I am a native American I make beaded earrings to sell...I was going home for family Gathering as i do every year 2nd week end in October..I used the earring display holder on my table..People could see them better I could put price over the Panel of each and divide them by price this way.. They were easier to see and easier to remove when customer looked at them...It Was great and handy to have i could even fold it back up with the earrings on them and repack for the trip home...But I didn't have many earrings left..Think i sold more this year than any other time..Folding Earring Screen (Clear) (10-5/8""H x 17""W)"
1,"I bought one for my daughter and one for me. We both love them, very easy to find your earrings now."
1,On the Christmas list and she was just thrilled when she opened it. Seems her cousin had one and that's where she first spotted it.
1,"This holds few or many earrings...looks good on a dresser, and keeps items tidy and in easy view. The lucite keeps it from looking ponderous."
1,"This product is exactly what I was looking for, it holds and displays all of my earrings and can be folded up to take up less space."
1,My daughter is able to store all her earrings in a neat and orderly manner- she may need another soon
1,This is a great way to store earrings and is portable. Well worth the money.
0,The item arrived on time but It was broke in half when I opened it. I would ask for a bottle of glue to come with it.
1,"This item is very good for all kinds of earrings. I had previously purchased 2 other kinds on Ebay, but the problem was that neither would hold all the types of pierced earrings that I have."
1,I just love this pair of earrings and they go with almost anything I wear. They are very comfortable to wear and I will buy from this company again for sure.
1,"I have both the purple and pink miracle ball belly rings, and this is by far my favorite out of the two. It is very shimmery and girly and has a nice iridescent sheen."
1,"The flute charm is so detailed and is of very high quality. You can see all the keys, any flute fan would adore having this item."
0,I was disappointed with the quality of this product the minute I opened the envelope. This is actually the first time I've ever been unhappy with a product that I have ordered from an Amazon vendor. I based my decision to buy this product on the photos made available during my search and I feel that the actual charm looks very little like the photo used. The charm itself looks cheap and scarcely resembles the photo. I'm not convinced that it is sterling silver. It also failed to include a clasp to connect it to the sterling silver charm bracelet that I bought from a different Amazon vendor. (Btw...I am very happy with the bracelet itself.) I paid more than $25 for this product and I feel that the quality is worth about half that. This is the first Amazon vendor that has let me down.
1,This was the best gift I could give to my Gma's. They both loved it and it came already gift wrapped :)
1,"My daughter is a new grandmother , so I decided to buy this for her to wear . She said she loves it ."
1,"This bracelet is a beautiful, quality item. You can't beat it for the price. Makes a wonderful gift for any grandmother. Can't wait to give it to mine on her 90th birthday. I'm sure she'll treasure it."
1,I was so surprised by the great quality of this product when i received it. I was a bit weary because the price was so amazing - but the bracelet is GREAT. I recommend this for any Grandma!
1,I Got This For My Grandma For Christmas And She Loved It! She Wears It Everyday And Shows Me It Every Time I See Her! Very Beautiful Bracelet And Love The Writing Inside The Box!
1,"packaged great, and will be perfect for any grandmother, it has a nice poem inside of the display box that adds to the gift.. speedy delivery A++"
0,This belly ring looks so cheap! It fell apart almost instantly and it's definitely not as cute and colorful as it looks.
1,Looks great! Very girly! I actually bought this same curved barbell ring in titanium with two 6mm balls and they both look great!
1,The pink color and the glitter make this a girly-girl must! Very cute and well-priced.
1,"I love all the tri-color glitter belly rings - the color combinations are fun, and the glitter looks great!"
1,The stone in this bracelet looks like a metal. It is shiny and bright. Nice bracelet for a man or woman!
0,Bracelet is strung together on strecthy band type string. Found it to be very bothersome to wear due to it expanding on wrist with any kind of arm movement. Finally on about 3-4 time wearing while at work and moving arms it stretched too far and broke and the piecec went flying and some shattered. I wouldn't buy this again. I recommend something more strung together with wire type string.
0,i bought this ring for my girlfriend when came the color was great but in less than month loose all the color now the ring looks very bad without gold color look like another metal.
1,This necklace is long enough to loop around your neck twice. It looks as pictured and I see no problems with it.
1,THIS IS A CUTE LITTLE RING FOR THE THUMB OR PINKIE STONES ARE VERY NICE WORTH THE PRICE!!
1,This is a very beautiful chain and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who'd like a silver cross. Just remember to get a chain that's long enough for your neck.
1,"This cross is simple, beautiful, and elegant. The chain it comes with is also attractive, and is not linked so loosely that it tangles constantly, though as it is a thinner chain one should treat it with care to avoid breaking it. The cross' size is small and rounded enough to seem feminine, to me, but perhaps that is only because I see my wife wearing and loving it. I can highly recommend this piece."
1,"i have looked at the item over and over and then i ordered it.no dissapointments with product,shipped quickly.very nice item! thanks"
1,"I love this ring! It is such a pretty buckle ring. Dresses up an outfit, but isn't bulky. You can't beat the price, especially for this style and in sterling silver? Forget it. Buy this, you won't regret it."
1,"Flashy - but not too flashy - the stones are perfectly set, and prominent. Sparkling clarity. Love it!"
1,THIS RING HAS A STONE FOR EACH ONE OF MY FOUR CHILDREN AND A STONE FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER. THE PERFECT MOTHERS RING FOR ME. THE STONES A BRIGHT AND COLORFUL AND PERFECT IN EVERYWAY. THIS IS A KNOCK OUT RING AND I LOVE IT.
1,Bought this upon a request from my 88 year old Dad to find him one. He is very happy wiht it and it is on his wrist every day!
1,Got this for someone with arthritis and he loves it. He said that it works and his hands and fingers feel much better.
1,"This is a nice solid copper bracelet that works for me! If your careful, you can bend it to fit perfectly."
0,"It is a very pretty bracelet, but I did not notice any difference in my arthritis pain. I wore it for about a month, night and day. In the end, I took it off because it did not seem to make any difference for my arthritis. It was a disappointment, as I was really hoping it would work."
1,"I purchased these earrings as a gift, and since the price was so reasonable, I wasn't really expecting that ""wow"" factor. Well, what a pleasant surprise!These earrings are gorgeous! The garnets are very high quality and the color just pops!They are truly the most beautiful shade of red! I'm going to purchase another pair for myself!"
0,"It tarnished quickly, cleaned poorly. After a month i threw it away. Its a waste of money."
0,"Be careful of these. They show to be silver in color, but came through as yellow gold tone. Seller stateddifferent shipments come through in different finishes. His site should state that. Otherwise cheap dine store quality"
0,"Beware image shows to be silver tone, delievered in cheap gold tone. Seller stated can not always control what comes in. Seller should state that colors may veriy"
1,"This earring is exactly as shown in the pictures. Actually I want a smaller one, but it is true to the size as in the description. Very pretty and good for summer."
1,These earrings are great. I got them to wear with a conch shell necklace I have and they are just the right shade of pink. Great summer - beachy - vacation earrings.
1,"I was given these earrings for the Holidays this past year. They are quite beautiful. The length is just perfect. The ""stones"" are perfect. I get plenty of compliments each time that I wear them, always a boost to a girl's ego.Yes, I am gushing."
1,My granddaughter loves this ring. I would purchase from this supplier again.
1,The pendant came safely and on time. Looks just like it did in the picture on the website. Good Job.
0,"These were smaller than I thought they would be. However, they are quite pretty. I wish the stones were larger, because the sunstone is so unusual. The quality of the workmanship and the stones is excellent, as usual. I'd just like to see these in a larger size."
1,"The product we saw on line, ordered, and sent were just what we expected. They were shipped quickly. We got what we ordered and in the amount of time we expected. Very satisfied. The gift box included was a nice touch since this was a gift."
1,Arrived 4 days early. They are more than I expected. They look amazing and the clarity is brilliant. I have had compliments in just one day on how beautiful they are.
0,"Beautiful - and a sweet little gift for my daughters BF - but ""little"" being the operative word here .They are very small - and although we knew that at the price they were not going to be what ""appeared"" in the picture shown - we were still taken aback at how tiny they were."
1,i bought the cufflinks for my husband on our thirteen anniversary and it came right on time. it was affordable and looked just as presented and best of all my husband loved it. keep up the good work. ideal for someone that likes flying whether as a hobby or a pilot.
1,"My husband is a pilot, and a huge airplane buff. He likes wearing french cuff shirts to work, so I thought this would be a hit. My husband loved them, and that was my goal. They arrived in a very timely manner,great price,and nice presentation box. Thanks cuff-daddy, I would buy from you again."
0,"This ring is just beautiful, works very well, but the stone popped out the 2nd time I wore it and I had to superglue it back on."
0,They are well made and cute but too small for me. The labradorite stone in the earrings are specs. Good for children. Product is well made.
1,I was very impressed with this item as it was just what I expected. I get lots of compliments on it when I wear it. I am very very happy with everything I have ever ordered from Silver Insanity and will continue to order from them in the future.
1,"I purchased these earrings on a whim. I was incredibly suprised with the detail. They are truly a great buy, and have a very elegant look to them when worn."
1,This is a great looking necklace for men. 6'0 185 and it looks and fits perfect.
1,"I've been looking for a great unisex NAVY ring and found it (wish they had a varity of sizes 6,7,etc) but very happy, found a silver smith & will have it sized. Thanks"
0,I just bought one and thought that it would be as sophisticated as the one in the picture. It actually looks more like the shiny coated plastic toy rings that I buy in the dollar store for my daughter. The finish is not well crafted and is actually clumsily done upon closer inspection. Not worth the price.Doesn't seem to be real silver either.
1,"A lovely ring, well made. Sturdy, so it will last. Very classic look, nothing to break or fall off, etc. Truly pleasing.A wonderful symbol of Life, Love and the Gnostic Path of Wisdom. I will wear mine for decades to come!"
1,This was a great puzzle ring for the price. Obviously it's not $300 quality ring but it's amazing for the low price! It took a while to figure out but that's what makes it fun. If you can't figure it out there are many sites online.
0,"this ring is not sterling silver. its made out of this black type of rock? I don't even know, it's for my girlfriend so its a smaller size, not like other puzzle rings where they're bands of silver these are like each individual rings connected like a puzzle ring. I've searched the site that the receipt is marked for; silver insanity to no prevail of finding the ring on the site to look what they price it as. Out of all the things I have bought for the holidays this year this is what i was really looking forward to to have some mineral covered in silver makes this a straight lie to sell as ""sterling silver"" if planning on buying this for someone i say don't do it. I look at reviews and decided to buy this for all the positive reviews this ring has received but it sucks. This ring is honestly a piece of junk compared to some puzzle rings I've seen and I don't now the prices so i can't say it may good for the price but i would have rather spent the extra money."
0,"The leather broke away from the silver as soon as I tried to open the clasp. The bracelet is large (probably should be labeled as men's), the clasp is very difficult to open so after I had it fixed and the leather cut down, I don't take it off. Too difficult to get on and off."
1,Very good product description and price. The item arrived in reasonably good time considering it came by Australia post.Will definitely purchase more.
0,"Watch out with these. I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart. The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off. They are useless now. Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive. The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.These are cheap and fall apart quickly."
1,I ordered these earrings for my daughter. She loves them and said they are the most elegant turquoise earrings she has ever seen.
1,"I was looking for a ring for my boyfriend that would show ""commitment"" and something that he could wear casually- this was it! I don't think he's went a day without wearing it this past year!! Very durable and stylish! SUPER HAPPY with this purchase!!"
1,"This multi-coloured CZ bracelet caught my eyes because it's dancing with vibrance. The multi-colours are captivating & the CZs are well-cut, sparkling & thick. The workmanship is good with smooth finishing. It's glamourous looking & can dress-up any outfit instantly. It's a one-of-its kind design & I can't find it in any other website. I'm fortunate to own it."
1,"I think it would probably be better without the diamonds, since they're too small to really add anything to it. I was having a really hard time finding anything like this without diamonds, though. The topaz was actually a bit larger than I expected and is a very beautiful color. I can only hope that she loves it as much as I do."
0,My earrings were defective. The metal is thin and one of the diamonds had a HUGE scratch down the middle. I sent them back for a refund. Amazon was great about refunding my money.
0,"I ordered these for my Girlfriend. They stones BOTH had large defects (I'm no expert in diamonds, so I dunno what it's really called). By defects I mean both stones had HUGE black flecks in them. At least they were symmetrical. :/ Anyways....other than that...they were great....at least I didn't make this mistake with an engagement ring."
1,The item was just what I ordered & came in a timely manner.
1,I think this is a very attractive ankle adornment. It looks good with a tan and is very durable.
0,This is a very pretty ring.It has one flaw. The mesh can become slightly unraveled around the edges and get caught on cloth material.
0,"It is a nice necklace, not sure if it is helping as it was advertised."
0,"I was very surprised and how small, thin and lightweight this was in comparison to the picture vs. the price. This is definetely overpriced for this item and the other charm I purchased."
1,"These are some of the most beautiful Laurel Burch earrings I have seen. They are a little heavy; I find them weighing my ear lobes down a little when I wear them. But other than that, they are crafted well."
0,"The pearls in this necklace vary from white, to pink, to peach, to beige. It is not nearly as pink as I hoped it'd be, but the upside is that the color range is so neutral you'll be able to wear it with anything. I don't really care for the clear fish-line that makes up the string of this necklace. What I do like though, is the fact that the stones are woven on in a way that makes them quite 3D....some stand up and some lean down, and you get a lot of movement in it as you go about your activities. So it does have an artful appeal even if the design is a bit simple. Since I think it's quite a bit more interesting than the usual plain strand of pearls, it'll make a nice addition to my necklace wardrobe. Just be aware that this is more of a subtle piece and not a ""knock-out"" design."
1,"I am a repeat customer of Silver Insanity and I have had nothing but good experiences with them. The ring got to me in record time. I love it! It's more petite than you would imagine by looking at the picture, but I am glad because I don't care for chunky rings and it's still very sturdy. I am glad I picked up this ring and I won't hesitate to purchase from SI again in the future."
1,This is one ring where the actual thing looks better than what you see online. The rainbow moonstone is small but that is perfect because it protrudes and anything bigger you would be knocking the stone into stuff (especially when ladies rummage for stuff in the handbags). The celtic design adds a mystical feel to it which makes you want to program it as a good luck ring or for protection etc. I would recommend this any day.
1,"I purchased this ring for a teenaged relative, and it's perfect for a girl that age. Cute and well made, but not too fancy. The moonstone is quite small, but it's got a nice depth to it, and the patterns in the silver are very well done. As other reviewers have noted, it's more delicate than the image suggests. I think it looks nicer in person than in the preview image, Silver Insanity should add a photo with a hand modeling the ring so customers can see it in context."
1,This is a terrific piece. I work at a higher-end jewelry store and everyone asks if I bought it from my store! Perfect.
0,"Ordered this item for a performance costume. The first copy came with a broken strand and the pearls rolling around in the shipping bag. We used the Amazon return process to return it and had a replacement within days. The second copy arrived in the exact same unusable condition. We can't try again, it wouldn't be available in time. Quality control on this product appears to be very bad."
0,"they ship really fast..which is nice, but ultimatly, this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine...it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures, plus the stone is not ""garnet"" it more so resembles the color brown...like a turd."
0,"I had received the earrings I purchased on Amazon and they were supposed to be RED garnets. But their color is far closer to Amber than red (as was pictured) and I was very disappointed. I wrote my problem to Amazon and to date have had no response. I had asked back then to either send replacement pair sent (at NO additional shipping charges to ME) that someone actually CHECKS the color or I would send these back for a full refund. The style is very cute - I even like the accompanying necklace and ring designs - HOWEVER....I then wrote to 6 different departments at Amazon asking for help with an exchange --- to this day, WEEKS later, None of the departments has responded. The holidays are now passed - I have a gift I could not give.Disappointed."
1,I found this to be a very lovely trinket for my Girlfriend's birthday.
1,"3mm is small. This was a perfect size for my second and third holes higher up on my ear. I usually wear very small gemstone studs or ball studs but I really wanted pearls for when I wear pearl necklaces but I had never been able to find any small enough. I got 2 pairs for when I want all four earrings to be the same size but I can also pair them with a 'normal' pearl earring that is 6mm. The nacre is a very nice quality and the shape is very round, not flat or misshapen at all. The threaded post is also a great security feature.For those not familiar with millimeters, please look at a ruler to see what 3mm is."
0,"These earrings are like microscopically small (trust me, they are very SMALL = -1 star)! When i first received it, I was very surprise that there's even pearls that small exists,and these are cultured??? (How was that even possible is beyond me! But since these are for my 2 year old niece, i guess these earrings will do!)Seriously, these pearls are not worth as much as the listed price said at all, I actually got my on sale for only $15, i guess i got a good deal. (Though one thing i don't like about these earrings are the back screw are so hard to put on (especially on a 2 year old who wouldn't stop moving around, it was very annoying actually! = -1 star)"
1,"After searching for months I took a leap of faith ordering online. So happy I did. I love my Armoire. Warm, rich color. Easy to assemble with quality workmanship, it compares to the 500.00 dollar armoires I had looked at. My husband was suspicious of the price I quoted, thinking I was trying to pull a fast one. When he saw the invoice he smiled and said. ""Nice find baby"" my girlfriends? Jealous :) Highly recommend this armoire if you're looking."
0,"I should have measured my old armoire carefully prior to purchasing this. I had it all put together, and then realized that I wouldn't be able to accommodate everything that had been in the older piece of furniture."
0,its really nice. it looks even nicer when its in front of you than the picture
0,"quality of this product is horrible, its was breaking apart in less than a week. the materials used to make this product were very cheap!!"
0,"I was hoping for something a little shinier, a little more delicate, I suppose. I saw another review that said it was smaller than they were expecting, and from my perspective, the photo portrayed the size pretty adequately. The links are wider and more square than I thought they would be. The clasp is adequate, but the manner in which it's joined to the body of the bracelet leaves something to be desired. The joins are hollow (which, if you look at it, makes sense - the body of any bracelet has height, and each clasp ends in a loop), but unfortunately it's not as strong as you'd hope. One of the joins has gotten smooshed a bit, as I'm not a delicate little flower, and since they haven't been welded nicely, they rub on and pull fibers off of some materials. I can push the ends back together with my fingers, which is convenient, but doesn't really speak kindly for the quality of construction.All in all, I think I overpaid, and it's not really my style anyway. Perils of buying jewelry online, I suppose."
0,The bracelet is comfortable and good for everyday. The only problem is the bracelet I received looked used and was dull and had scratches on it. I thought I was purchasing a new product -- for the price I paid.
1,"I ordered this bracelet as a gift and ended up keeping it for myself. It is a bit difficult to fasten, but doable. I like the look of it, the weight, overall it looks very nice."
1,"This is a great bracelet for anyone who finds wearing bracelets and working on a computer to be uncomfortable. The thin, mesh design of this piece is incredibly comfortable and can go from casual to dressy. Great addition to my jewelry collection."
1,it was a gift for my Daughter and she sure love's it. I would recommend it to anyone. Very elegant.
0,Was very dissapointed in the overall look of the product. The silver was very dull ... clasp sticks - hard to open ... Not sure if I'm going to keep this ...
0,bracelet is too small and too thin. Does not look like a high quality piece of silver. Don't waste your money.
0,"I was satisfied with the quality of this bracelet...it looked more expensive than it was and I love how it looks on my wrist. It was way too big for me though; if it were a few inches shorter it would have been perfect. I took it to a jewelery store to see if it could be sized, and they said that they would have to sauder it which would ruin the finish and expose the silver and it would tarnish easier. The guy at the store advised me that sizing it would not be the best idea. So, it's a great bracelet, I just wish it was 6 1/2 inches instead of 7 1/2."
0,I was totally disappointed when I received this bracelet. The photo makes it look like a very classy and quality item when in fact it's very thin and looks and feels very inexpensive. I probably will never wear it.
0,"This was a little gift I bought my Mother just because, two weeks ago.. It is ok... My Mother loves it and has not taken it off since I purchased it. Right now I am keeping an eye on luster. So far so good. I'll keep you posted."
1,I adore this bracelet! I own a ring which is white gold and diamonds and has a very similar design to the bracelet. When I saw this bracelet - I just had to have it. It is gorgeous! The clasp is very sturdy and secure.
1,"I like this necklace, I wear it all the time. I wish I would have gotten a shorter chain though because on me it falls right where most of my necklines do, so it gets hidden a lot."
0,I ordered this item and received a gold cross instead. Returned it for a replacement of the correct item and received the same exact cross again. Canceled the order and am now waiting on a refund. I will write again if the wait for refund takes longer than it should.
0,"This is an appropriate size for a very young girl (my granddaughter is 4). But the chain is a little too thin and knots in very tight knots very easily. I'm usually good at getting these undone, but it took me 15 minutes of patient work with a toothpick and some salad oil on the knot to finally loosen it enough to undo it."
1,"got this for my girlfriend for v-day and she loved it, good cheap gift for a first v-day with a nice friend."
1,This is a beautiful product. The fit is good. My wife has to wear it a certain way on her thumb because the legs poke her the other way. It is very sturdy and strong. We are very impressed.
1,"this is a GREAT product. i am on my feet 8 to 12 hours a day. im a chef, before i used this my lower and upper back and shoulders killed me. now i dont even feel them. when i take the necklace off when go to bed i dont sleep wiht stuff around my neck. my back starts screaming. i have had one before and gave it to my boss because he had wicked bad back. i also play golf and i dropped 3 shots because i had more flexiblity and my back wasnt hurting at all when i finished all 36 holes."
1,"I don't know if it really works or not but recently my husband had to help my neighbor's moving and he 'felt' he recovered faster after that and 'feels' good every morning with it. Feels good = endolphine, right?I should've gotten one size smaller though. If you are not that huge muscle built around your neck 16"" for a guy whould've been just fine."
0,"I have used one of these for a month, and I have observed myself, my general wellbeing, and my backpain with and without the necklace, while sleeping, while doing sport, while at the office... and I have not noticed any difference at all. For this, and because, in my research, I have not been able to find a even a single scientifically justified reason for these to work, I am giving it one star. I only hope that others read this review and think twice before spending their money."
1,Exactly what i expected and saw online and in the store. No healing abilities but it was no surprise. I like it and i think it is ok for its price.
0,the neckless is ok but the company i bought it from are very rude would never buy an ite fro the again.EVER
0,"Come on, people! If these products really worked, everyone would wear them! The manufacturers want you to think they work, so they can sell them and make $$$. I have tried the phiten, and the balance bracelet, and magnetic therapy. I have noticed no change in my myriad aches, pains, and stiffnesses. I have worn a phiten necklace for over a month, just to give it a chance. If anything, I feel worse with it on, so I am giving up. Save your money!"
0,"The necklace is unattractive and doesnt lay right on your neck. It's made of rope and magnets and the rope is too thick and twisted. I returned it asap.Phiten Star Necklace, Black, 22"""
1,Just as advertised and still in the original package half the price of the local sport shop! Shipped quickly! What a bargain!
1,"The necklace was received in good condition, and appeared to be new. I gave it to my friend as a gift, and she was terribly excited."
1,"Both my husband and I use these to relieve our neck & shoulders of the pain from herniated discs. We wear them daily, and they do take the edge off. We have been using them for over two years now."
0,"I don't know who the hell thinks this works, but it doesn't. Nice necklace though. I haven't stopped wearing it just because I don't have any other necklace to wear."
1,Our grandson wanted a Phiten necklace for his 12th birthday ... this was a last-minute purchase but it arrived even quicker than expected so it was here in time for his birthday. Sometimes it is hard to impress a tween ... this gift was warmly received and is worn every day. Now a younger grandchild is putting this item on her Christmas wish list.
0,"I can't believe there are so many gullible people out there. These necklaces don't actually do anything. Look up phiten and pseudoscience.Like David Hannum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."""
0,"Bought the 22 inch Navy Blue one. Should have bought a longer one as it can still be seen when I wear formal shirts at work.More importantly, I dont see any benefits with wearing this.I will give it a couple of more weeks and if I still see no benefits, I will write it off as one of my many frivolous purchases."
1,I bought this as a gift for a niece. She told me that she liked it a lot and so did her friends.
0,"I wore this for approximately 2 months, and hardly noticed any change. Maybe, I need to wear it longer, but I have noticed almost no improvement with my back pain."
1,"I like this product, wearing it for 5 years and I truly believe it functions well."
1,"He hasn't taken it off since he got it. He is 11 and it is a fad at his school. They have these in one of the sporting goods stores here but they are $30 and up- and I couldn't see paying that much for a necklace for a kid. So we ordered this one instead. It is durable, the colors are nice and bright, and my son seems very happy with it."
1,"Well... actually it looks really cool.. so cool that my friends are asking me to buy some more of this product for them.Regarding the effect on me, I could tell that it really works. I'm a baseball player and I haven't felt any particular pain in my body since I started wearing it!!!"
1,"I but this just for what was said about it, and I have to admit, because a lot of MLB players use it, I figured, if they use it then it has to work, since I bought it and started wearing it I have not taken it off and my head, shoulders and neck feel great."
0,"I ordered two 18"" but received a 18"" and a 22"", obviously I can't wear the 22"" one. I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22"" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item."
1,Little neice requested this for CHristmas. She loves it. Little pricey but I guess this is the new trend for the young folks.
1,"I've done a little research on this type of product; the reports show mixed results. The necklace might be a placebo, but it keeps me aware and, therefore, works for me!"
1,"I absolutely love the Phiten Star Necklace. It's comfortable, practical, stylish, and everything listed in the product description. I would recommend this product to everyone."
1,"I don't know how this thing works or if it's psychological or just plain coincidence, but my joints feel 100% better since I started wearing this necklace. I had a sore shoulder and sore knees, and since I started wearing this they feel great. If you have joint pain it's well worth plunking down $20 to try one of these necklaces!"
1,This charm was much prettier than it appeared in the photo. It is the perfect weight and came with a nice chain. I ordered one for my daughter and wished I'd gotten one for myself.
1,"I bought these for my wife because she would always take her ring off to wash her hands or go to bed and she would forget where she put it. Now with these we put one in the kitchen by the sink and the bathroom sink, she always knows it's on one of those 2. She loves the way the look and they are very strudy. I highly recommend to any one looking for a gift for your wife or someone else who wears rings alot."
1,"I purchased two of these because I got one for myself and sister, my sister and law saw it and I got it for her for Christmas! The second one I will give to my best friend because we always take are rings off when we cook or wash the dishes. This is the best way to put away rings and you know they are safe and won't go down the drain!"
1,I ordered these for my 7yo niece and they are beautiful! Perfect for little girls!!
1,"These are lovely earrings. I bought them because they very closely resembled another pair of earrings I saw in a catalog for around $70. They are lightweight and therefore very comfortable, and I always receive compliments when I wear them."
1,If your into fishing they are great. My wife loved them. She teaches 1st and second grade and the earrings were a big hit with the kids.
1,"The diamonds are good in the 3Cs. The ring is very petite and works perfectly as a stacker or side ring. I bought the ring on sale and feel it was better valued on a sale price that on the original price. I wear it as a stacker to my engagement ring which has a very thick band and large center stone. It does not compete with that ring and is a nice complement. It also looks very nice in between my two 2mm bands for when I want to switch my rings up a bit. But again, it is a very small, petite ring. It would make a nice promise ring for a teen or early 20 something."
1,"I love these earrings because they dress up any outfit I am wearing. They aren't too heavy and look good with anything....and the price was right. I love 1928 jewelry anyway, but these are a good buy!!!"
1,Two of my favorite things...sand dollars and starfish! I love these earrings. I wore them at the beach and even when swimming. The salt water did not damage them. Definitely a good purchase!
1,My daughter loves Tiger Eye jewerly and I was thrilled to find these and she was thrilled to recieve them.
1,"These look great for the cost. Understand that the ""jewels"" are plastic as you might expect. However, they look great and the detail is better than I had expected. I bought these and a few other pair like them for my wife for Christmas. She was very pleased as she can wear these with dress up or down. I believe she told me this brand is also available in one of the department stores like Macy's, Sears, or Penny's if you happen to be at the mall. Price was on par with costume jewelry in the store."
0,"I wanted something small to match a black beaded necklace. This is nothing fancy about these earrings, but small enough from a distance they look quite elegant."
1,Bought this for a lady who loves lighthouses. Perfect little gift and a very reasonable price. Good workmanship. Would suggest this product for others.
1,"Liked fine. But this product is ""going out of style"" it appears and is being replaced by other add on bracelets. Quality was fine and better that the cheap knock-offs."
0,"While my wife loved the necklace and the matching ear rings she only wore it for about a week before the stone fell out.Great price, looks great, earned me a few points, and then ended in tragedy.I wrote that review and the next day a rep from Silver Insanity contacted me and offered to replace the item. So I'll bump them up to 5 stars based on some excellent customer service and a good product at a reasonable price."
1,"i recieved these today,and was very supprised at how pretty they are. lots of color, shine, and sparkle.these speaks for themselves"
1,"I was surprised when I receive these earrings = They look better than I expected - I like the lever-back closing, and while very dainty, they are very pretty, just the right size and very light"
1,"Very unique- vivid colors- quality crafted- ,I bought this bracelet as a hug for myself- I am a caretaker & finding myself stressed- I happened to see this bracelet while browsing ""jewelry""- --A great mood fixer-Delivery, packaging very satisfactory-Will recommend & buy from this seller again-"
0,I don't know why they call it Swarovski Crystal. There is no brand on the bracelet. The so called silver is unpleasantly coarse and rough to the touch. I don't' like it at all.
1,"I love Swarovski crystal jewelry and when I saw this bracelet, I had to have it! It's even prettier in person!! The crystals are beautiful and shimmer, just as Swarovski crystals should do. The design of this bracelet is awesome.It's very well made, no worries with it breaking, high quality sterling silver, too. It's so comfortable on my wrist. If you want a stunning piece of AFFORDABLE jewelry that will make people stop and look, then get this piece!"
1,I received this for my birthday and it is absolutely gorgeous. The pastel colors on this bracelet are wonderful for spring (or any time you need sparkling colors on your wrist)! The crystals are very shiny. Definitely worth the price!
0,"I'll need to change the clasps on these to a lobster claw; the size on these is huge because the kind of clasps used gives the bracelet (must be) an extra 1/2"" or so. So, it will not hang JUST loosely on my wrist; it slides all the way to the middle of my palm. And my hands are not small; I have average-size hands. I was very close to returning the item until I thought of the lobster claw modification, which is a great idea because it'd be a shame to have to return a sparkly bracelet that looks so nice."
1,I bought the bracelet for my daughter who is in college. She loves and wears it everywhere. I was so impreseed with the product that I'm buying another for a wonderful friend birthday.
1,"I thought this ring was very nice, and my amber had plenty of ""debris"" ( referring to the review below). Each piece of amber will be different, so it's not going to look exactly like the one pictured"
1,"This is a pretty bracelet. It catches your eye and the eyes of other people. It never looks exactly the same, b/c of the way the light hits it. And it looks good with pale or tan skin- b/c I have been both during the time I have had the bracelet.My mom loves it, too- she asks to borrow it so much, that I am giving her one for a gift. Defintely buy- it is a good deal!"
1,Very pleased with this bracelet. The crystals are gorgeous.It is a WOW bracelet!
0,"They must use great photography because the picture looks NOTHING like what I recieved. The bracelet came completely tarnished and discolored. It doesn't even look silver, it's brown and rusty. The beads look a lot cheaper than what the picture shows. I was excited to buy this bracelet, but was completely let down when I opened the box. This was supposed to be a gift for someone and I am embarrassed to give it to her now. Sorry I wasted my money."
1,"I really like this bracelet. It's very shiny and quite substantial. I wear a 7 inch bracelet, and this one is a bit big on me."
0,"I bought this ring to replace my wedding ring after I broke my ring finger and my old ring didn't fit. When I got it, the ring seemed like cheap aluminum. I guess you get what you pay for. My daughter wears it now and likes it. That is why I gave it 2 stars."
1,"These earrings were purchased to compliment the prom gown I purchased for my youngest sons prom date along with the matching necklace and bracelet. The stones were clear and sparkled brilliantly, the silver was polished to a glow. The jewelry looked beautiful against her tanned skin."
1,"I highly recommend this design - the picture does not do the intricate detail of this ring justice; looks SOOO much better in person! Nice medium size for any finger, too. :)"
1,"not your typical ""interesting silver shapes on a band""-ring.This ring is cute, pretty, and well made, to be worn in and out of the shower.Overall a great product. Doesn't bend or fall out of shape like some rings, so Go for it."
1,"I'm a large male and was afraid this would look feminine, but it does not. It is chunky as other reviewers have stated. Feels handmade, not mass produced. I think it is lovely. The symbols are an owl, horseshoe, elephant,pair of children ( I think), four leaved clover, 13, and a final undefinable phallus shape ( maybe corn?). I'm quite pleased with the purchase and would order again. Cheers."
1,"...just how much I love this ring. Is there a reason I can't give more than five stars?It looks so delicate and dainty, but it holds up amazingly well. In my opinion, it looks even better than the picture showed. It's very feminine and the detail is wonderful. Just gorgeous. I've already gotten so many compliments on it that you wouldn't even believe.The sizing is exact. I'm surprised it's not more expensive. If you're thinking about ordering this ring, stop thinking and buy it. I've been searching high and low for a pretty, inexpensive ring made out of a metal that won't turn my finger a weird color, and this one is perfect.It arrived three business days after ordering. Sabrina Silver is aces in my book.*FAIR WARNING"
0,"I had bought this as a promise ring, but it arrived a week after I was supposed to get it. It was too late to give it to my girlfriend because she went back to college two days before I actually received it. I contacted the company and they gave me a cookie cutter apology that upset me."
1,"My friend and I decided that we wanted to get friendship rings. When we saw this ring, we knew it was perfect. [...]. It came in a pretty little box and bubble-wrapped. When I opened the ring, it looks just as pretty as when I first saw it. Their is a somewhat antiqued finish, but not too much.The ring sizing is exact, and it fits very nicely. It also does not turn my finger funny colors like other rings, and as I am paticularly hard on my jewelery, it is very strong. You would be led to believe that intracite details would be more prone to breaking, however that is completely incorrect in this case.[...]."
0,"When I viewed this on line and read the description, I expected a bracelet that felt heavier.I recently purchased an equally good looking, actually better, sterling men's bracelet twice the weight of this one on eBay for half the price of this one."
1,"I picked this out as my engagement ring because we're not going to go into debt for a ring and I don't like diamonds. This ring is even better than expected! I had read the reviews saying it was smaller than they thought so I wasn't expecting anything too special but let me tell you, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL and bigger than I was expecting. The band is small (which i love) and it makes it look even bigger! I couldn't be happier with my engagement ring! :)"
1,"This piece, like all of Rodererick Tenorio's pieces, is an extraordinary example of native North American Art. Once you get one piece, you must collect as many as you can!!!!!!!! 100% satisfaction guaranteed.I own 12 pieces and am still collecting.Violet. SW Florida."
1,"ring was nicer than i though it would be,size of the ring was perfectand the style of the ring was perfect"
1,This is a great product that was received quickly and was just as beautiful in person as in the picture. It's a Christmas gift and I was pleased that I chose this product.
1,"I have been always hesitant to purchase jewelry via the net ---- checking to see what's available versus retail, I decided to give it a try trusting Amazon for reliability and convenience and safety of ordering. My husband has been wanting to buy me a ring for our 46th anniversary and we just couldn't find anything in our price range in stores.So, I searched and found this ring --- it is stunning. I feared the sapphires would be pale and artificial looking; they are just the opposite ----- the ring fit perfectly (size 8 - I usually need 7-1/2)and it reflects light beautifully. A perfect complement as a special ring. Silver Speck delivered the ring within a few days after ordering - I received it on Christmas Eve !! Thank you Silver Speck for elegance and fine design."
0,"I don't want to return this item; however, I was a little disappointed - the quality of the chain wasn't the best in my opinion. The chain was a little too large and not what I expected (even though it was supposedly copper or copper coated). The Irish penny was very lightweight. I think the item would have looked so much better on a nice silver chain ... a little more streamlined. I'm sorry to say, that I'm not happy with this product; however, it was given as a gift so I won't be returning it."
1,This ring is beautiful. I bought it for my daughter for x-mas and she really liked it. Its very beautifully designed and the words are super!!
1,"Looking for a cheap but interesting gift for my eccentric friend, I decided to purchase two types of stone chip stretch bracelets. The Turqoise being one.It compliments my friend's wide array of trinkets, giving her another simple but interesting piece to collaborate with the others. A bit of polished stone is timelessly classy.A good purchase for the price; the shipping is more expensive than the item. Buy it on Amazon though, as other sites and stores charge a bit more for such a plain piece."
1,"This is a nice little bauble -- good color and a good match to the turquoise chip earrings. My wife may want to get more to combine them on her wrist for a more dramatic look, but I'm sure she is going to like this stocking stuffer on Xmas morning.One reviewer used it for office gifts -- a great idea for $ limit Secret Santa gift giving, or just as a small token of thanks for that favor someone did for you. At $2.99 you can stock up and be prepared."
1,"The turquoise earrings are stylish, trendy and fun. They are well made. well worth the price."
0,"The item I received was not the item pictured.It has a very different chain link design from the one pictured and the opals are set in a different direction.The clasp is strange and hard to to take off without force.The ""genuine diamond accent"" is one microscopic stone haphazardly slopped on.As for the diamond itself, despite its size i could see that the stones cut is horrible.It looks like it was cut with a hammer.I may smash a drinking glass on the floor and replace the ""genuine diamond accent"" with a broken shard for a cleaner look.But that's what i get for buying jewelry online,One gets what one pays for."
1,I love this bracelet. The opals have alot of color and are well matched. Also the price was right. It looks great on my wrist and I would recommend this to anyone who loves opals like I do. Also it was a quick delivery.
1,This is a lovely necklase of natural chips of stone. There are of a similar matched style and matched size. Very appropriate for the purpose (Christmas present) and stocking stuffer. I am sure the receiptent will be as pleased as I.
1,"I purchased two of these pendants for Christmas presents for the girls in the family and one for myself. All i can say is this is not only a beautiful pendant but also a very durable one. The top and bottom pieces of the pendant rotate and at first i was scared it would break easily...NOT SO! I'm still wearing it and i never have taken it off except a few times to clean it. I get so many compliments on it, and in the sun it casts rainbows everywhere :) Shipping was speedy and the product was great!"
1,"Bought this for my 20 year old daughter who loved it. It is a nice sized piece, and it sparkles beautifully."
0,The clasp broke the third time I wore it. I really loved the colors because you could wear it with so many things. I didn't feel like going through the whole return thing.
0,I really liked these earrings but they are so heavy I can't wear them.I think the metal chosen was of a less than perfect metal...meaning extra cheap.Don't buy these earrings unless you like the idea of your ear being ripped open at any given moment.
1,"I bought this ring for my fiance for our wedding and it is perfect. It is exactly the same ring we tried on in jewelry stores for double or triple the price. Great workmanship, lovely and shiny just like the picture. Also, I got my band (slightly thinner but otherwise the same) on a different website and they matched perfectly. We couldn't be happier with this purchase and my fiance will proudly wear this forever."
0,"The necklace is pretty; the filigree appearance of the silver around the turquoise is attractive. The turquoise stone itself does not appear to be real, although the ad for the necklace says that it is."
0,Very pretty earrings but after one wearing the second tier of stones broke off. It is obviously a design problem. Very disappointing.
1,I agree with the other review. This is a very comfortable ring. It is beautifully made. Anyone searching for a thunderbird ring will be very pleased with this product.
1,The product is beautiful and the customer service with this company has been the best I've encountered in a long time. Wonderful product and a wonderful company - what more can you ask for? Thanks!
0,"The ink in the writing held perfectly for a couple weeks and then suddenly starting peeling and was completely gone in a few days. This despite the fact that I never wore it doing dishes or anything similar. I definitely have to strain to read it now. The band is shiny and smooth when you buy it but very quickly starts to get scratches. The ring is solid and is cut in such a way that it isn't exactly comfortable on my finger.On the other hand, it serves its purpose which is to remind me of the serenity prayer. And it's inexpensive enough that I don't feel cheated given the above issues."
1,"The ring was a gift for my boyfriend, he loves the ring but the company shipped a size 13 vs the 11 I ordered. It's sort of a hassle to send it back because he is living in Korea at the moment...luckily the exchange can resize it :)"
0,"the ring is ok. just ok. it's thinner silver than i thought it'd be, so it probably won't last forever. very shiny, but it'll dull down as i wear it. it took many many weeks to arrive and i contacted the seller more than 4 times w/ no response. i would never buy from this seller again."
1,"This pendant looks so clear and sparkly. I'm not convinced that it is genuine swarovski crystals because one side of each crystal does have a very faint coat of gold paint (you have to look very hard to see this), however I also saw that on some of the jewelry at the actual swarovski store, so that may be how they should be in order to make them sparkle as beautifully as they do. I gave these away as a gift and all the recipients were very happy. For the price this is definitely an item worth getting."
1,A real eye catcher. Light reflects off the many facets causing a dazzling display. I real love this pendant!
0,I ordered this pendant to go with a similar cube earrings I bouth from the same seller. I was very surprised when I saw the size of it - it's huge! This means it's not elegant at all and goes mainly with casual outfits. I was hoping it would be more discreet.
1,I got this pendant along with the earrings. It has great sparkle and takes on the color of whatever you are wearing. I do recommend buying the matching earrings because it is a great pair.
1,I ordered and recieved this charm a month ago. I love it! I went to San Francisco for vacation and wanted a charm that would remind me of the wonderful time. This is perfect. The detail is fantastic.
1,"One of the most prompt services we have ever experienced. Beautiful enhanced color black pearl stud earrings. Items quite as described. Look lovely. Thank you, Dahlia."
1,This is the perfect starter jewelry box for a 4 or 5 year old. Not to many things to break and easy to open. My 4 year old granddaughter opens and closes it all day long and it still works. It also has enough storage for a little ones jewelry.
0,"I put this on my daughters wish list and a relative purchased it for Christmas. I had promised to wrap it for the sender, and good thing because I never gave it to my daughter. When I opened it the ballerina was broken off (and could not be glued, I tried) and it is made so poorly for $27!! This wouldn't have lasted a week with my three kids and it looked so nice in the photos..."
0,The jewelry box is pretty and the child who received it is delighted with it.
1,All of these bracelets that I have bought are lovely. The cards that come with them are really cute and the bracelets themselves are beautiful.
1,"The wife loved this - it had her favorite saying, her favorite color and a heart on it. When she opened this for christmas she was thrilled."
1,"excellent design, very beautiful. recommended to give to friends and girlfriends.the colors are striking but sensillos simultaneously. a beauty."
1,my girlfriend loved it! she said it was a great charm bracelet! it got here fast and i haven't had a problem with it yet. so it good!
1,"bella muy coqueta pulsera, cumple con todas lo indicado,Pulsera de vino en una caja de regalo muy bonito y tambi&eacute;n en una bolsa de pl&aacute;stico con una bonita tarjeta y diciendo."
0,"I like things that say ""Live Laugh Love,"" so my boyfriend got this for me for my birthday. After wearing it a few times, it was clear the quality isn't good. It got scratched, and looked tarnished/faded! And I only wore it to work, nothing crazy!"
1,I love my bracelet. I love the saying Live.Laugh.Love. I wear my bracelet every where and iv gotten many compliments on it.
1,"I received this in the mail as a birthday present (my birthday is March 11th) from a guy I've been dating on and off, and I have to say it is a really beautiful piece of work. Not to mention it comes in a pretty gift box with an inspirational poem card inside, and plus it's really pretty. I love it so much that I will be ordering more!"
1,This is a high quality piece of jewelry with easy-to-use clasp. It sparkles and is stunning on the wrist. The gift box it comes in is an added asset.
0,"these are plastic, not crystal or metal. Very disappointed. still waiting for the seller to respond so I can return it. Suitable as a childs gift."
1,Appropriate for anyone. My sister in law received this and loved it. Reminds her to not sweat the big stuff in life and remember to laugh each day.
1,I really like these bracelets. They fit nicely and look great. I recieved a lot of compliments on these. I will be buying more. Thank you.
1,"I love this bracelet! The bracelet itself is, of course, gorgeous. It's so pretty and the red beads make it stand out even more. The words carved into it match the message in the box. Now it comes in a very cute little box that makes great for gifts. And the best thing is the message. I love it. It's a great buy! Great for birthday presents, Christmas presents and presents for yourself ;)"
0,"the cross i recieved wasn't quite the same as the one in the picture. in the photo on the page the cross looked more square, when i recieved it was more rounded on the sides. the bail is also larger than it looks the picture. the actual cross measures 37mm (just shy of 1 1/2 inches) and the bail is 15mm (just shy of 3/4 inch)."
1,"I ordered 3 of these Bracelets for friends of mine in Ireland as a Christmas present, they were just delighted with them, the detail on the Bracelet is lovely and the poem gives that special touch for a friend."
1,I bought this for my friend and she absolutely loved it! Will probably by the other bracelets in this line for family members because it is affordable but has excellent quality. I highly recommend this product/
1,I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend in the US (I'm in Australia) she loves it. Thank you
1,"Great product at a great price. I gave it to my best friend for Christmas (I didn't get anything in return, but that's another story) and she loved it."
1,"I ordered this bracelet as a gift and it arrived fast! I was so happy that it came when it did. The product came in a nice gift box, it was really nice and the poem enclosed was very special for a special friend of mine. This product looks so much better in person and does not look cheap at all. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
1,I choose my gifts carefully while trying to save money. This product did both for me(
1,I bought this bracelet for a dear friend of mines to show how much I love and cherish our friendship but I wanted something that was low cost but still nice and this product was IT. I love the bracelet and the words on the inside of the box. I can't wait to give this to my friend;)
1,excellent gift. sent and my friend loved this item. it made the most wonderful gift. it is beautifully made! high recommend.
0,These are a little larger than I expected and they don't come with rubber backs. The STL logo on the pair I received isn't as white as the picture shows. I also ordered the studs and they are a better size and are whiter. I would suggest getting the studs if you are trying to decide between the two. The studs match the necklace well.
1,I love my Cardinals! These earrings were the talk of all my cardinal friends. They are not cheaply made thick but not heavy. I will be getting more products from this company!
1,I got my tennis bracelet today and I adore it. it is beautiful. It is prettier than the picture. And got it so fast. Thank You and will be shopping with you again. I am really impressed. Kimberly J. :)
1,"I bought a pair of these a while back when I was getting ready for an interview. I know how to look professional from time to time, and felt the need to hide my gauges for this particular interview. Needless to say, I got the job. These silicone hider plugs did the trick perfectly. Only downfall is you have to buy them separately."
1,"I ordered this for my husband. It is beautiful, well-made, unusual. He loved it!!"
1,"I love these earrings, they look better than the picture... just beautiful, just the right size, I couldn't wait to wear them to work today.You can't tell from the picture, but they are strung together with what looks like clear fishing line. The pearls jingle in my ears when I walk, but I don't mind.The shipping was quite fast considering they came all the way from Thailand. And they came in a cute little keepsake box. I am very pleased with my purchase!"
1,This ring has brought many compliments and admiring glances from friendsand passer-by people.The shipment was immediate and in good condition.Thanks and hope you have many more items of this showmanship.
1,I wear it everyday.It's better than the real thing.Thank you.
1,Ordered 2 silver bands as temporary wedding bands. They were shipped immediately and look great.
0,"The ring is nice looking, and fits. It's hollow. I don't know what it means to say ""solid"" sterling silver, and maybe I'm just ignorant about jeweler's jargon, but solid to me means not hollow, and one hundred percent of the stated material.So the claim, as far as I can tell, is only half true.Obviously, this is not something that anyone in their right mind would pass off as an actual wedding band, to a lifetime partner. I bought it to wear for kicks, and it serves its purpose."
1,looked all over for a ring like this and finally found it at amazon. it fits perfect and is beautiful. thank you.
1,bought this as a temp ring for my new husband and he loves it ..
0,These earrings were not at all what I expected. Very little sparkle. And the picture seems to depict a darker color which is what I wanted. They are definitely silverish in color. Expected much more sparkle. Kinda cheap looking too.
1,"If you are short on bathroom drawers for cosmetics, buy this for your medicine cabinet. It holds mascara, brow gel, lip gloss, eye liners, nail pencils, tweezers, grooming scissors for brows and nail clippers. There are better tools for lipstick alone but I find this indispensable. I bought one and later bought a second and both are full. Also, they are built to fit well inside a medicine cabinet. Excellent product design. I just love this item."
1,"I received my charm last week, and I love it! It's adorable, and looks great on my charm bracelet. Sturdy and bold type so it's easy to read. I love having a charm to show tribute to my dachshunds :) Very cute charm, I would highly recommend it!"
1,"Good price, for the quality of the produced. Fast shipment to get me working. will order again and again. Thanks"
0,"Bought this ring last May 2011. It arrived quickly. I bought this ring to wear in place of my engagement ring when I go out, mainly to the doctors & the grocery store & shopping, which is about once every 2-3 months & I don't wear it every time just when I'm feeling ""dressy"". I may have worn this ring about 3-4 times. When I got the ring I noticed that 1 prong was a little thin where it bends over the stone (stone has a slight bluish color if not clean; but when clean it is white) & that the stone wasn't centered in the setting but the stone wasn't loose (it didn't turn in the setting). I've had to stop wearing the ring, which I loved wearing, b/c the stone is to loose in the mounting & I don't want to loose it. If you get the ring & notice any thing wrong contact Palm Beach then, even if you think it will be alright (ie"
1,I love this little bracelet especially as it is quite inexpensive for something so pretty.
0,"The description said 7 piece set, but when you look at the product picture you think your getting 7 pieces not 7 little rings for the arm. I paid 2 times more for this shipping than the product cost. Then I got 7 pink arm rings where the picture shows several colors. You can't pick the colors because you are thinking they are coming in a multi pak. I had no problem with the item being sent here but this company stands by their name."
0,i order them few days ago .and i dont like them at all .they are easy to bend and it dont look how they show in picture :( waste of money
0,The product picture makes you think you will be getting something with color. I was very disappointed when i opened it and found plain gold. The color was the reason i bought them for my daughter. I guess you get what you pay for.
0,THESE WERE JUST CHEAP. BROKE FIRST TIME TRYING TO PUT THEM ON. WERE NOT EVEN WORTH THE MONEY PAID FOR THEM. I WOULD HAVE GAVE THEM AWAY
0,I thought it would come as it is shown. You get seven tiny bracelets....not seven collections of bracelets each. It comes in a very small box that you could probably get at a dollar store for...well...a $1.
0,"No choice of color, and all of the pieces come in the same color. Really inexpensive, but equally cheap in appearance. Don't waste your money here."
1,Lo compramos para una adolesence y quedo encantada cuando recibio el regalo. pienso que es muy apropiado y sobre todo por el precio es muy buen producto.
0,"In this case, you get what you pay for. Cheap price = poorly made product."
0,Very disappointed in this purchase. It's much tinier than it appears. I gave it to a child instead of the adult I purchased it for.
1,These earrings are everything I wanted and a very good quality. I will diffenitly order from this site again.
0,I was disappointed in these - I had expected something more elegant. They are heavy and look dated.
1,"I just received these earrings yesterday, and they're absolutely beautiful! The stones are a little larger than pictured, but other than that, what you see is what you get. They're not too heavy on the ear, and the length is perfect. They dangle just above the shoulders. The silver is very bright, as well. I've purchased other jewelry from eve's addiction, and have never been disappointed. Highly recommended!"
0,"Difficult to clip them together once they are through your ears. A decent product, and I would consider buying them again."
0,"Good thing I have small wrists, because it is small and the glass beads are also very small. This would be good for a pre-teen girl, but not for an adult. Not happy with my purchase."
1,"This is a beautiful bracelet! The stones are darker than they appeared on my computer monitor. They are a beautiful robin's egg blue and the small silver beads accent the blue beautifully. It fits my small wrist and would look just as good on someone with a bigger wrist. And you won't be saying that it's smaller than you thought it would be. It's substantial without being overpowering. Even with the shipping charges, it's still a good deal."
1,this is a very strong'and nice bracelet'i wish it came just in surgicalsteel'
1,"I was a first-time buyer, very skeptical, of purchasing a diamond piece on-line from the United States. I chose a little paveed bee pin from Ross-Simons because it was not too costly and was so cute. I took a chance and ordered it just a few days ago. I received the little critter today and was totally pleased with its quality. The diamonds are lovely white, clear and sparkly! I was also very impressed with how quick my pin arrived! Thanks for the great on-line shopping experience. Ross-Simons I will return! :o)A Satisfied Canadian Shopper"
1,I ordered this ring and i love it. It fit perfect. I will defently be comming back.I don't won't to take it off. Debbie Hicks
1,This sterling silver ring is almost the BEST of my jewelry possession. You just can't imagine how elegant and delicate it appears to be - far beyond my expectation. Gorgeous!
1,I love this ring. It is so feminine and pretty. It came in a little gift box which was a nice touch
1,"This cord came to me extremely fast and was the perfect length for a pendant I just got when traveling in Turkey....It is made extremely well, with a great sterling silver fastener."
0,"I ordered this rosary, (a descision I made after many years of experiencing awful nightmares, and constantly feeling tormented by dark spirits.) I thought this would bring me comfort & serenity at night. Upon receiving this in the mail, I was very disappointed. The wood is flimsy, bracets are barely holding it together & the ""holy water"" looked like thick molasses! I spent the few extra bucks on this peice, mainly because of the holy water it claimed to have. When I received it, I could not even tell what the liquid substance in the capsule even was! I'll tell you one thing... It looked like liquified ear-wax, with a slight hueish tint of a color I can't even describe. If this was even water, it sure wasn't blessed! The cross itself was pretty but THAT IS ALL. If you want to purchase this item, don't count on handeling it at all unless you want to end up with broken peaces & an empty wallet. I am in no way shape or form a materialistic person, and there is no price I'd put on my lord Jesus, but I bought this peice expecting genuine quality that could represent my love for god for many many years to come.... And I am sad to say that what I purchased is nothing but a cheap neclase that I couldve easily made myself with items from a local craft store!! After realizing how flimsy and breakable this rosary was, there was no way I could hold this at night when I sleep.. So I hung it in on the rearview of my car for decoration. Some protection my $20 bought me! :-l Needless to say, the very next day, someone broke into my car, stole everything I had, and the rosary was broken into a million peices. Some sort of luck it gave me! Not only was this peice nothing like the picture & description, the faith I had that this would bring me comfort and protection diminished as it has brought me nothing but bad luck. My advice to any of you, is don't buy this peice of junk! Everything about it is fake. The picture is a fraud, the description is a hoax, & when you receive it in the mail, you will be disappointed. The wood is fake, the holy water is fake. It is not durable, reliable or sturdy. And unless you want to use this rosary for looks only, don't count on your blessings when it comes to this peace of bark-wood! Literally! Wish I could get my money back! Sadly, this is my first and The last rosary I will purchase from this company. Good luck and good riddens!!!!!!!"
1,This is an amazing company and an amazing powerful rosary. I am so grateful to have gotten this and feel its power when I hold it or wear it.
1,This is absolutely beautiful! The wood is awesome and shines like gold. This was bought as a present. I can't say too many more spectacular things about this item.
1,This is special for me. I love this gift. If you are a christian are a believer in God this is a good item to have. I have been bless since I have it.
0,I like this rosary. The olive wood beads are very nice. The links however are very soft metal which is a shame because it is a fragile rosary and I am concerned about everyday use.
0,Bought as a gift for my niece's baby girl. Not happy with this item. So small it would have gone right thru the baby's ear. Box it came in was smashed and broken and hinge was scotch taped together. Returned it
1,"Perfect tiny little earrings! I love these by themselves in ears with just one regular piercing - they are such a darling little size! They would also look good as a second piercing, as they are fairly low-profile, or in a nose piercing."
0,"This is a nice necklace no doubt, but the hemp cord is really short. I'm a petite woman (under 5ft) and the necklace did not fit over my head."
1,"Delivered on Time, The product was what I expected, and just how it looks in the Page."
0,"They claim its silver, it's not. It is however pot-metal that has been plastic coated, mine had rust on it. The pendant is HUGE too, they should include dimensions for these things! They don't sent you a necklace with it, they send you a piece of leather string. If I wanted to tie my own necklace I would have just bought the pieces sperately cheaper! Overpriced piece of garbage."
0,"I'm a first-time buyer of this brand. I wear this pendant very frequently, and I anticipated the cord being cheaply made, so I bought one separately. The pendant itself looks a little yellow which makes me question its authenticity, but overall the service and delivery were good."
0,"From the online photo I thought this bracelet would be red and black. The one I received was dark, reddish brown and dark brown. It really is very pretty, but didn't go with anything in my wardrobe, so I returned it. If you're into wearing fall colors I think you'll like this. The beads were uniform in size and color."
0,This is a pretty little bracelet with lots of colors so it goes with lots of different clothes.
1,This is definitely not machine made. Time was clearly taken with the details of this box. This served as a wonderful gift.
1,This is a beautiful nose stud. It's big enough to actually see it but small enough to still be feminine. It's caused no irritation like another 14k nose stud I have that I paid much more for. It fits in so perfectly I can't even feel it. Definitely worth every cent we paid for it.
1,This is a great toering. A definite must for people that like to decorate their digits.
0,The picture gave me the impression it had a two-tone appearance. It is very small - but not bad for the price
1,I wanted to find something that represented my relation with my husband and this necklace is actly what we represent.
1,I am 89 years old and i LOVE this necklace! whoever said old ladies can not wear fashion things are nuts! i wear this with everything......... from my Fridayy night BINGO nights to clubing in L.A with lindsey and paris
0,"The picture was pretty, but the cross is SO SO tiny...as small as the nail on my pinky finger. I meant it as a gift, but went shopping for something else."
1,"I love this necklace. It's prettier than I thought it would be. People have been writing how small it is. Well, it's exactly the size I thought it would be. It's dainty, but elegant. I'm going to buy a few more for gifts."
1,"I bought this for a 2006 Christmas gift and I am very pleased. I know my daughter will be, too. It comes in a pretty purple velvet bag, a nice box with cotton and includes instructions on how to keep it nice. I got it at a great discount at one of the Friday Sales."
0,"I definitely like this necklace and am happy with the purchase. Like a few people have already commented, it is much smaller than you would think by looking at the photo. It almost looks like the type of necklace a store would sell for children. You know, like in a department store, in the jewelry section, they usually have a display of necklaces for kids. well, that's what it is like. I still think it's cute though, just be forwarned about the size."
0,I ordered this as a gift and had to return it. The silver was poor quality and had markings on it that I could not remove.
1,"Picked this up for a special gal christmas of 07... she's got a pretty decent level of rock in her blood; she absolutely loved it! may not be ""expensive enough"" if that's what matters to the person who's gonna actually rock this, but otherwise... 'tis perfect!"
1,"I just got this yesterday, it is just beautiful!I got it for myself; it's a good price and the skulls look like Oingo Boingo mascots; my favorite band, so I thought why not? Treat myself.The quality is not the finest I have ever seen, the way the skulls are attached is through quick sliver solder, but it is sterling. As long as you're not hard on it will last and the detail in the faces of the skulls and their smiles is very good quality; and for the price, how do you argue?I love it, and will wear it for a long time to come."
0,"This item is constructed decently and is of good quality. The only problem is tht it is too small. It was listed under men's jewelry. My wrists aren't extraordinarily large and I can't get the bracelet to fit. I'm going to see if I can modify it with some spacers or something. If it was larger, I would have rated it higher."
1,"As stated by others who purchased these earrings, the picture doesn't do them justice. They are beautiful and well worth the cost. I immediately put them on upon receiving them. Will enjoy them for many wears!"
1,Thought the earrings looked lovely on the computer screen and was even more thrilled when I saw them in person! These will make a lovely holiday gift for a friend who is deeply spiritual and active in her church. I am checking out this company for more treasures ASAP!
1,"I really adore this charm. It's absolutely beautiful and perfect for you or the male in your life. It's well crafted and worth every penny! Thanx! Sorry I did not review sooner. Oh, I say perfect for male also, b/c it's a pretty good size and won't look ""dainty"" on a guy. great product!"
1,"I received this beautiful ring as a gift today, and I just wanted to say how wonderful it is. It fits perfectly, the sapphire set in it is beautiful. Very well-crafted... and it came with a hand-written post card from Bali! Also in the box was a little handmade corn husk type flower, it was just so neat to get this from Bali. Thank you!!!"
1,"This was exactly the necklace I was looking for. Perfect size. I wanted someting that was not too big and inexpensive enough to not worry about it. Diamonds are ok. If you want them to keep sparkling, just clean with jewelry cleaner and that does the trick. I LOVE,LOVE, LOVE this necklace!!!"
1,"I just got this necklace and have worn it twice. Both times, I received many compliments. The previous poster didn't like hers, but it does have the boho look I am after and is very casual. I will wear mine often!"
1,"I was extremely pleased the moment that I opened the ring box. The gold is thick and perfectly formed, and the stone is gorgeous and clean!What an amazing deal, this is a very high quality ring."
0,"The pendant was larger than I expected, but the chain was garbage. It was way too long and flimsy and the clasp was broken."
0,"The earrings are beautiful, however, when they arrived, I noticed that one is purple and one red. I'm waiting for the company to send me back a pre-paid return envelope along with corrected set. I'm still waiting. These are a gift, so I'm very anxious. I hope they follow through like they promised."
1,"I'm returning some other earrings I bought from SilverSpeck and getting more of these to give as gifts. They're absolutely beautiful! The stones are a nice size and the filigree makes them really stand out, while still looking delicate (again something you'd find in the Metropolitan Museum catalogue!). And for a great price too!"
1,I love this necklace. It was just what I was looking for. Every time I wear it people comment on it.
0,"Product looks exactly like it was described and came in a small bag that wasn't opened. However, I haven't even worn it because the ball is extremely too big, it's actually bigger than any other tongue ring ball I've seen. Very uncomfortable."
0,I really like the detail on this tree. Just wish it wasn't so thin. You need to make sure there is no chance of bending it.
0,"As an internet based jewlery business, American Pearl has a 30 day return policy. This is necessary due to the fact that you cannot see or feel the jewlery in person and you are buying based on photos.I ordered the Shooting Star earrings and they arrived in about a week later. Unfortunately my fiancee didn't care for them. I returned the earrings for an exchange (10 day turnaround to ship back, process, and recieve the new item and received the second pair). Again she did not care for them.I then started the return process. You need to get an authorization number to retun the item. Unfortunately they are only available between 9am and 5pm M-F, which due to a busy work schedule, took me a few days to reach them for a RA#. I shipped the item back and waited for the refund to hit my credit card.The entire purchase/exchange/return took 33 days. Instead of a refund I received a store credit. I called an explained that an exchange took place on the original item and should therefore extend the 30-day policy so that we could have time to recieve and assess the second pair of earrings. They stated store policy was 30 days regardless of the number of exchanges.This is not appropriate -- nor explained anywhere on thier website. It was also not explained during any of the phone conversations that occurred.Buyer beware..."
1,Very beautiful necklace. It is much shinier than the picture and it was well crafted. I wear it with most of my pendant now and 16 inch is just perfect for me.
1,This is a beautiful ring. My wife gets complements everytime she wears it. The sizing tool was accurate and helpful. We will continue to look for great deals like this in the Jewelry section
1,"I've had this for over a year now and have found nothing at fault with this armoire. The finish, style and construction are excellent. Does not look cheap at all, and has tons of storage."
1,"I'm glad I purchased this jewelry armoire. It looks great and perfectly matches my other furniture. I definitely needed it, as it was becoming overwhelming looking through my jewelry. Now everything is perfectly organized. Good buy at a decent price."
0,"I was extremely disappointed with the poor construction quality in terms of fit and finish. The side doors and top mirror lid did not fit properly after assembly, there were noticeable uneven gaps when the doors/lid were open as well as closed. The finish was terrible. Several areas on the legs were not stained so there was an obvious color difference. Also the wood grain did not uniformly match on the various pieces."
0,"ITEM WAS ORDERED ON DECEMBER 4, 2012, RECIEVED ON DECEMBER 29, 2012, , I WAS TOLD BETWEEN DECEMBER 13-18. I REALIZE THE STORM, BUT, THIS IS EXCESSIVE"
0,"I ordered this well in advance for a Christmas present, but was informed a week and a half before Christmas Day that my ordered was canceled without explanation. Will NOT attempt to buy anything from Visiondecor Furniture again!"
1,"I purchased this piece for my 87-year-old mother. I noticed excellent reviews, but my concern was whether it would arrive without any dings or scratches. The unit did arrive in perfect shape. It took less than 10 minutes to assemble (with minimal tools required - I think I just needed a screwdriver.) The build quality was excellent. All drawers and hinged components had a solid feel and articulated perfectly. My mother was thrilled.This is an excellent value."
0,"Very nice Armoire, was a week late getting here, the lid is smashed, the side compartment was ripped off the hinge. What a joke."
1,My wife loves the style and beauty of her new jewelry armoir. Excellent construction and holds all of her stuff and then some. Definently a very good buy anf the price was great.
0,I ordered this because it looked real nice and when i opened it the wood on a couple of the drawers were lifted so i was kinda upset. You pay this much you expect better quality.
1,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife and is a great addition to our bedroom collection. The finish is a red oak and matched perfectly to our bedroom furniture group. The piece arrived very timely and was well wrapped. Other comments referred to the package arriving damaged and the furniture being damaged as well. The box was within another box and was very well cushioned. The carton had protectors on every corner and it literally took me 10 minutes to get them all off and be able to open the box. The piece assembles very quickly and is a very high quality. Drawers are nicely lined in felt, move in/out easily. The top and mirror were well constructed and add a nice touch. The pull out sides offer lots of nice storage for necklaces. Overall this was a great buy! Good price, great shipping and high quality unit. A definite 5 start recommendation."
0,"This armoire is beautiful...just what I was looking for; however, I did not find the color to be ""Cherry"" or anything close to it. It was actually closer to the color of a medium oak. But since I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back and paying additional shipping charges, I gave the armoire to my daughter, who said it suited its purpose. She enjoys having the mirror that's attached to the flip-top."
0,"I ended up purchasing 2 of these units. The first one came in really quick and packaged very good. However when putting it together we noticed the left front door hinge was not installed correctly and when assembled in factory the person or machine ended up splitting the particle board with the screws. So we sent that unit back and got another. This unit came in again really quick and packaged nicely. Once again the left door was damaged by the hinge, wood actually split. Coaster has no Quality Assurance or Quality Control. These units look nice but Coaster needs to unpack then when they arrive from China and inspect them. Again Amazon did nothing wrong in fact I am impressed with Amazon for they way they handle returns."
1,"Received the Oak Armoire in a timely manner and it was very easy to assemble. All parts were here and in 15 minutes it was together. The drawers and storage doors all fit well, and it is a nice looking piece of furniture. Well worth the price."
0,"I was disappointed with several aspects of this purchase. First I was told it would be delivered within two weeks of purchase. When the two weeks passed and I did not receive any notification as to a delivery date, I contacted the vendor. I was informed delivery would be delayed for several weeks. I believe the vendor should have notified me there would be a delay before I had to inquire about it. Second, when I finally received the armoire, one of the drawers was falling apart. Fortunately I was able to repair it because it would have been impossible to send it back to have it repaired. This was a disappointing purchase."
1,"We ordered this as a Christmas present, not really knowing what to expect. It arrived in a well packed box with lots of reinforcing cardboard. It was in perfect condition and easy to assemble. We are as pleased as we can be with it and hope the gift recipient will be as well. Nice wood veneer, a good height, and a sturdy feel."
1,very pretty it was what i wanted and more.i would buy from seller againthanksbob
1,"This ring is very pretty, soft and feminine. I wear it everyday and get lots of compliments. It is a somewhat large ring so I wouldn't wear any other rings on the hand I wear this one on. It was worth the money."
1,"Diamonds are small, but nice color, lots of sparkle, my wife loves them, she says they are beautiful and was very surprised when I gave them to her for our anniversary. Would buy again."
1,"I received these for Christmas from my Amazon wish list, and I am very impressed. The pictures online do not do them justice -- the crystal is amazingly reflective and sparkling, and faces of the links are bigger than I expected (the dimensions listed are probably right, but the picture online isn't nearly as big as they are in real life). Also, the picture online seems to show a copper-colored layer in between the crystal and the link. Mine don't have that -- the base is all silver, which makes more sense.Overall, I'm very pleased with this gift. I'd recommend these to anyone who likes to wear french cuff shirts and has evening occasions where a little 'bling' would be appropriate. I'm even thinking about getting the aqua-colored ones, as well."
1,"This is one of the most beautiful pieces of jewelry I own. The stone if perfect and the setting different than most you see now, which only makes it better! I get more compliments on this than on any of the jewelry I have gotten from Jareds!"
1,I bought this for my boyfriend. This is one of the only tounge rings I found that has the plastic balls and our favorite colors. We both love it.
1,My husband surprised me with the ring and it is so pretty and petite. For a person with a small finger it looks good.
0,"The earrings were specifically cheap, I understand, but holding them closely you can see that the final cut shows a large square on the top of one earring and a tiny square on the top of the other earring. I guess when they arent together they will look fine but dont expect the earrings to look the same at all they are completely different but the same size. could have been better since they are in white gold, I would expect this lack of cut symetry in sterling......buyer beware...."
1,These were a gift for my husband and he loves them. Especially since he's not allowed to get real diamonds anymore because he always loses them.
1,I was very happy with this product. It was a gift for my nephew (go figure teenage boys) and he wears them everywhere.
1,Just got my ring in today & I love it!!!! It's exactly what I wanted. Fits great and it's great quality. I only wished I would of ordered two. One for each foot.
1,"Upon receiving the Spirel Pendant - it has fast become one of my favorite pieces of jewerly to wear. I receive many compliments on the piece and in fact one friend asked me ""why didn't you purchase one for me!"". Ordering from this vendor was easy and fast. I received the necklace in record time. Thanks Amazon.com for offering this piece.- chris."
1,"I read other's reviews prior to purchasing and have to agree - this is an amazing piece, especially given the reasonable price point. I'm very happy with the necklace and have received a lot of compliments on it. My only (admittedly picky) issue is that the string it comes on is a bit rough. I love that it has adjustable knots so you can decide on the length that's best for you but if you have sensitive skin you may want to trade the string out for satin cord."
1,"I got this one for my birthday--in short, the skull is an emblem of mine as it represents the seat of the mind. Anyway, it looks great and is much larger with better detailing than I expected. It's a great introduction to Dan's baubles and I will happily order again!"
0,"I've ordered several inexpensive necklaces of a similar type to this one, all of which I've been happy with. This necklace was the exception to the rule, and is the only one I've never worn. This pendant looks nice enough, but there's a problematic design flaw. The cord or chain you use to hang the pendant around your neck goes through a metal loop which is behind the hilt of the sword (you can see this loop in one of the available images of the item). Unfortunately, this loop is over-sized and sticks out. Because it sticks out so far on the backside that should be laying against your chest, the sword is made to rest awkwardly and has to tip to one side or the other. There are a lot of other great necklaces for around this price, so I suggest you purchase one of the others which don't have this problem."
1,"This was a great buy. I bought it for a some of my favorite young men, and they all loved it. My only regret is that they ran out of them. Very well made, heavy pewter, with a unique celtic design. I was very pleased with it!"
1,"I wanted to get a few stack rings so I bought this one first to check quality. I loved it so much I went back and boought it in white, light pink and another of this dark pink. The sizes run a little large from Gem Avenue but that is part of why I like buying from them, I am about an 8.5 and most eternity bands only come in whole sizes. So the smidge of room works for me, I just buy 8. Very good service, I will likely use this company again and most likely buy this ring again just in another color. I wish they would come out with this ring in amethyst, peridot or emerald colored stones."
1,Excellant seller. This item came packed well and very quickly! I would buy from divadiamonds again!
1,"Husband really likes this, he is still wearing it and the string it came on is good quality. Nice design"
1,"This item is exactly as portrayed in the photographs. It boasts a simple, masculine design with a brushed finish that is shiny but not too ""glittery""-- again, a masculine design! It comes with a black cord that is long enough to fit anyone and that can be trimmed with scissors to whatever length you desire. It comes with a black velvet bag, too. I highly recommend it!"
0,I know this is an inexpensive ring but it looks so much more 'cheap' than the photo online. Save your money.
0,The dragon was black not blue. It was the blue dragon that appealed to me. I had to give it as a gift
1,"When buying on line in general, we try our best to find an item which is closest to what we are looking for, and then, on some level, speaking for myself, I keep my fingers crossed, for until you get it, you really never know. This beautiful 7MM CZ Stud Earrings couldn't be any more beautiful, couldn't have come any quicker, and exceeded all my expectations. Great Quality, Great Sparkle, Great Price and a Great seller, Simply Wonderful"
1,This is small but well defined. It fits perfectly on a smaller omega chain and feels good against your neck. I love dragons and this is perfect for me.
1,"This ring is the perfect tiny size. The band is thin and girly. I really like pugster and will buy from them again. The ring can totally pass as real, which is what I wanted."
1,"My husband ordered the white gold rocking horse for me as a gift. It is absolutely beautiful. It has more diamonds and sparkles more than I expected. It is a great addition to my charm bracelet. I also have the pacifier which I really like...but the rocking horse is really gorgeous.One note...it is a good idea to have the ring between the charm and the lobster claw soddered together. If pulled, the ring can open up and you could loose your charm. Not a big deal...only a few bucks at your jeweler."
1,"Very nice earrings that the wife adores. A very good price for me. In spite of a major winter storm, they still came before Christmas!"
1,"They are Beautiful, and light weight! I don't even feel them.I got many compliments.I reccommend you buy them for you or someone who likes feather weight earrings.I love them!"
1,I received these earrings as a gift. They are the perfect size and weight. They aren't huge and gaudy but very elegant. I wore them to the theater last night and received several compliments.
0,"You will be shocked with the real size, which is much less than on the picture!"
1,A really nice piece of bear jewelry from the well crafted pewter bear claw pendant to the adjustable cord. It's a nice size without being ostentatious and has a nice weight to it. Looks good when dressed up or dressed down.
1,"I picked this up as a stocking stuffer for a teenage girl. She loves it!!! It's relatively heavy and seems well made. The necklace is cloth, but seems to be sturdy enough for daily wear..."
1,"I bought this for my son. He loves and wears it practically every single day. The black cord makes it easily adjustable to be worn long or short. The pendant is slightly oval which would make it bigger than, say, a quarter by an 1/8 of an inch on right and left sides if you were to lay a quarter on top of it to measure it."
1,"Cute Stretchy Blue Howlite Turquoise Chip Braceleti bought four of these as stocking stuffers. i cant believe the low price, with quality. $4.95 which included shipping for all four. HSBTR"
1,I got this as a gift for my friend and she loved it. I was very impressed when I saw the necklace.
1,"This necklace is cute and long lasting. It won't break anytime soon, and the package arrived on time. Only problem I have is 1. I don't know if its sterling silver so I'm extra careful, and 2. I'm not a fan of the chain that came with it (long, black, thick string like chain) that is knotted on it. But other than that its a wonderful necklace and I love how many compliments it gets. Overall"
0,"The necklace was everything it advertised, but it tends to break, a lot. Once it's broken, it's difficult to use again."
0,"Normally when you get a piece of jewelry and it's bigger than you expect - it's even better. In my case I wish it was smaller. However with that being said, the product was perfect in every other way. Great packaging quick delivery!!!"
1,"I've had this necklace for two years, and I love it. It's great for those who are into Gothic and vampire things, like I am.Another reviewer wrote that the wings often break because they move, and that's true. I'd advise you to super glue them, and be careful with the bat. I super glued his wings, and then hit the pendant against something and the wing broke off again.Aside from that, it is overall one of my favorite necklaces that I own. The necklace itself is adjustable, so you can make it a longer necklace, or a choker if you wish.:)"
0,"I purchased this bracelet as a gift last December. The quality of the clasp is quite poor and it gradually lost it ability to stay closed. Recently, the bracelet fell off because of the poor clasp and was damaged greatly. Avoid this bracelet!"
1,"Did not arrive in time for Christmas, but Pugster reshipped with a gift coupon as an added bonus!I will certainly order again and the the pin is so cute. My mother will love it!"
1,"I bought this pendant from Dan's Jewelers. First off, I must say that everything I've gotten from Dan's has been very high quality and very nice jewelry. The star of david itself is simple, yet appealing to the eye, as the star is painted on the front. The only issue I had with it is the pendant is SHARP and you can punch holes into paper. The pendant comes with a black cotton rope necklace, which I cut off, because it was so scratchy and stiff. The pendant looks awesome with a chain."
1,"This is the most admirable, respected, and honorable necklace I have ever worn. I am so proud to be a Jew, and I want others to know that fact too."
0,"I would not reccomend this to hang around your neck, My son hangs it on his rear view mirror and it looks like that."
1,"I was really happy to see this unique-looking whale pendant. A lot of killer whale pendants look like fat dolphins, but this one actually looks like an orca! Awesome!I was slightly disappointed in the differences between mine and the photo. The rostrum (nose part) of the whale in the picture looks really well done, but mine looks messy where it was soldered and is rounded like a beluga. Also, the loop at the top has a line down the middle, which is fine, but it is different than the photo. Mine also had a slightly sharp bit off side of the tail. Just be aware that the finished pieces aren't necessarily perfect, but for the amazing price, you really can't beat it!That said, I wear it often, almost every day. I love it because it looks like a WHALE. I love it so much that I got a second one to send to my friend who works at SeaWorld. She loves it too!"
1,Thought it would look cheap in person but it doesn't. It's great for either a man or a woman. Received numerous compliments. The cord that it came with is a tad flimsy but I love that it's adjustable. It goes well with casual attire and if you feel like getting a little fancy I would suggest swapping out the cord. Overall I am very pleased.
1,"Just arrived and i'm super happy. This thing is very large, sturdy, looks gorgeous and super expensive, great quality details on pendant. Was planning to use on a nice thick silver chain i already have, but now i'm not sure i'll do that. It comes tied in place on a woven thick string cord. Actually it's a dual cord system with slip knots, so you can adjust to any size, slip over our head, then shorten the length back up. Very cool - guys will love this !! Only downside is to get pendant off you have to cut it off and ruin the necklace part, so i'm thinking i'll just wear as is."
1,I got this pendant for myself awhile back. I love it a lot! I wear it at least 3 times a week and it's very comfortable.
1,"It arrived on time, a day earlier than expected. It also came with a pouch to put the necklace in. The pendant is the right size, not too flashy, not too simple, i will buy from Dan jewelers again in the future."
1,I really love this necklace and its a huge hit with my little neices who all love to open and close the top and see if I put anything inside. I get a lot of comments about how pretty this pendant is and how unique. One of my favorites.
1,I got these earrings as a Valentine's gift and love them. They are perfectly feminine and charming. I wear them all the time and get tons of complements on them!
0,"We bought this item as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law, who recently underwent breast cancer treatment (and has now been given a clean bill of health). We were disappointed in the pendant's small size and general lack of bling. The chain is also quite delicate (translation"
1,"Love this traditional looking spoon ring. you can wear it for casual to dresser style outfits. It blends to make that prefect look. I wear it at work, going out on weekends, etc. I would recommend it. It's true to size."
1,"This is great for my emeralds and pearls---there are not many products that you can use for them, so I was thrilled to find this."
0,Don't waste your money!! It made mine more tarnished and weird looking. I would not buy this product if I could have a redo
0,"I'm sure that this product does what it says it does, but I can't tell you for sure, because it never reached me. I ordered the delicate gem and pearl cleaner for my engagement ring, which has pearls in the setting. What I received was the standard formula which clearly states that it is not safe to use on pearls. I've never had this problem with Amazon before, but needless to say I'm very disappointed."
0,This stuff is expensive. Especially considering how well it works. A little lemon joy and warm water works much better and does not leave a film behind. Will keep looking for a safe cleaner.
0,This had to be the worst merchandise anyone could possible think of spending money on. I would recomend buying any other cleaner before ever thinking of concord technology again.
1,"Bought the matching necklace first and she loves it, so I got her these and she loves them, too."
1,One on the best dog charms I have seen.
0,"I do mean tiny earrings. Loved them because I could keep them in at night, but easily lost one of them because they were so tiny I couldn't find it in the carpet."
0,"one of the earing was nice, the other looked defected. rubins were milky and diamond was burried, can't see it at all. they wouldn't repalce one, instead they refunded the money."
1,"I took a chance buying these earrings as a small gift for myself since there were no reviews yet. I was a little worried because reviews of similar 4-prong earrings from Sabrina Silver had problems with the stem breaking, so I thought I would give these more substantial settings a try, especially considering the price and 30 day guarantee. I'm glad I did! I have worn them a couple days, and even slept in them after forgetting to take them off... no problems so far!When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed with the appearance. The sterling basket setting is very nice looking, an upscale look if you are looking for diamond look-a-likes. Keep in mind, the basket setting sits higher than a typical prong style, so keep that in mind when ordering. The stones are not too large and sparkle nicely - note the 5mm diameter measurement under product description. Get out your ruler and look at the little marks between centimeter marks - count off 5 and you'll have an idea of how large this stone is in each earring. I actually took a few pairs of studs that I have and like the size of and compared before ordering.All in all, a great purchase at a great price! Thanks Sabrina Silver! I'll be trying more of your styles soon!!!"
1,"I am in shock how lovely this bracelet is (once I got it out of the three large boxes it was in - it was wonderful going through each succession of box until I got to the small one). Haven't taken it off my arm yet. Very pretty, dainty. Perfect gift. Rose gold is my new favorite jewelry. I doubt you'd be dissappointed. I certainly wasn't."
1,"I am so impressed with the service and the pendant. It is beautiful and was here within 3 days. This is the second thing I have ordered from Taos Trading and I am very impressed. When I had a question about the product, I got a reply in less than 24 hrs. It's nice to know that there are honest and helpful people out there."
1,Blitz is an excellent jewelry cleaner. It cleans all types of jewelry without all the toxic smell and harsh cleaners. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and safe jewelry cleaner.
1,"love it, works great. Just kind of nasty that everything after the first time will be in the dirty solution as well."
1,"When I purchased a engagement ring for my wife, the store had their own brand of cleaner, which they gave us for free. After it was time to replace it, I looked and saw it was made by Blitz. So I ordered this."
1,"My father is a jeweler, and he gave this to my fiancee to clean her ring with. It's super easy to use, and does a great job at cleaning up jewelry. We've always used old toothbrushes to really get jewelry clean, so I can't say that we've had any issues with the basket or brush. I would recommend this product to a friend."
1,"Cleans jewelry within moments, and no scrubbing involved! I was so sick of the paste that I would have to use toothpicks getting out from my jewelry. Love this stuff!"
1,"This product works well and the cost is great. I really like Stuhllers brand, but you cannot get it unless you are a jewler and my jewler doesn't carry it anymore because they make the customer buy it in bulk. So I decided to take a chance on this brand based on reviews. I like the fact it doesnt smell and am always in favor of the interior basket and brush."
1,"WOW!!! Blitz Gem and Jewelry Cleaner is the Best, yes, yes, yes I recommend itIt will make your precious jewelry shine and sparkle like new, and you'll be able to clean your jewelry with or with out the machine. I do both and the price is right.Blitz Gem & Jewelry Cleaner Concentrate (8 Oz)"
1,"I never knew this product existed until my mother-in-law told me about it. The first time I used it I had to have my own! It will make your precious jewelry shine and sparkle like new, and you'll be able to clean it whenever you want to right at home!"
1,THE CLEANER COMES WITH A BASKET AND A LITTLE BRUSH SO YOU CAN CLEAN YOUR JEWERLY ITEMS VERY WELL. AND THE BRUSH LETS YOU CLEAN IN AROUND PRONES ON RINGS AND GEMS.
0,"the cleaner works fine but the jar it comes in is not well made and it is difficult to open and close. It makes a mess every time I use it. The last jar I had was made from better material, but this is just junk!!! I will not purchase this item again."
0,"I used this solution on all my silver necklaces and it didn't do a thing. They look exactly the same. I don't know if the one I got was the wrong formula, but I now need to buy something else."
1,this item was an xmas present and the response I received when I gave it to her was overwhelming. I was extremely satifised with this item
0,"I ordered many rings and this one I am not going to keep - will give it away as a present. It is ok. The quality is good, I just don't like the way it looks. It is too plain in reality, not sparkling."
1,Bought this for my charm necklace. I was looking for something quick and easy to put on. The clasp makes all the difference. No need to bring it to a jeweler to fasten the charm. Great deal.
1,This bracelet is so impressive on. Pictures can't do justice. This is a real winner for everyday wear as well as dressing up a bit. You just can't go wrong with the sparkle and shine of the crystals and color!
1,This ring looks exactly as pictured. It's very comfortable and the three gold colors go with everything. It's great for everyday and dress.
1,"Every time I wear my bracelet, I get compliments. This is my favorite bracelet...the colors are beautiful. The crystals sparkle in any kind of light, especially in the sunlight. I would buy this bracelet again for a gift or if I find it in another color, would definitely buy again. Very nice bracelet!"
0,"The pictures online look terrific and if it's Swarovski crystal it must be beautiful, right? WRONG! What a HUGE disappointment this was. I was embarrassed to give it as a gift because although it seemed like a bargain when I ordered it, what arrived would only please a little girl pretending to be an adult. Don't waste your money."
1,"First let me start by saying that I have lots of Swarovski jewelry. This is DEFINITELY not glass, it is indeed genuine Swarovski. This bracelet is absolutely sparkly and gorgeous. I'm wearing it right now. :) I am very picky about my jewelry and cannot find one thing to complain about. I have the matching earrings and love those as well."
1,Bought these for my bridesmaids & they were even MORE beautiful in person! great gifts
1,"For some reason I looked at the pictures and thought this bracelet to be mostly blue. To my surprise the purple in it was most dominant, which is fine! My girlfriend absolutely loved the bracelet. I'd recommend this bracelet to anyone."
1,"One of the most beautiful bracelets I own, and I own a lot of braclets."
1,Loved these earrings so much bought two pair. Bedautiful detail size a bit big but I like it. I would recommend them to anyone. And a great deal.
0,Item looks wonderful...but does not lay flat on the neck. Had a couple of kinks..I am returning the product.
1,"a very nice classic necklace. Mine was ok w/ out any problems, kinks, and lays fine on my neck.clasp is a LITTLE hard to get open but other than that i love it."
1,"My Family needed these charms(20), For my father-in-laws funeral as a sign of pride and solidarity. He was a 30 year NYPD veteran. We received these charms in 2 days. the customer service was fantastic and the quality was great. We would highly recomend this company."
0,"The earrings were nice, but a little on the flimsy side. The peice that goes into the ear is very easily bent. The shipping was quick, and so was the service."
1,High quality stones. The prettiest of blues I've seen in topaz. Picture doesn't give this ring justice. Stones are much more blue than the picture shows. Beautiful cut stones and silver setting is much more attractive than gold. Couldn't ask for more in beauty.
1,Once again I am thrilled with my purchase from Gem Avenue. The ring is all it is described to be and it is a comfortable ring to wear. Plus I like the compliments it brings.
1,Was exactly what I expected. I receive many compliments on it when I wear it.
1,I sent this item to my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!!
1,My girlfriend loved these. It is her first strand of pearls and she was very happy with them. Thanks for the great product and prompt delivery!
1,"I don't usually purchase jewelry on the web, but I wasn't impressed by what my local jewelry stores had to offer or their prices. Augustina has excellent reviews, good product and excellent prices so I thought theywere worth a try. Much to my surprise the necklace arrived the day after I ordered it and I only paid a little extra for standard four day shipping!The necklace is exactly as described and comes in a nice gift box. I had a couple of quick questions about the necklace so I called customer service. I was connected immediately and the gentlemen I spoke with was helpful. If you are considering purchasing pearl jewelry then you need to consider Augustina's."
1,I received the pearl necklace two days ahead of the estimated delivery date. The pearls were of good quality and the box it came it was very nice. This will make an excellent christmas present. Thanks!
1,She definitely loved the pendant. Got here nice and quickly and came packaged quite well and safely so absolutely nothing happened to it. Thanks a lot!
1,"lovey charm and just what i wanted for xmas. item shipped very neatly and very fast. i was very happy with charm to add to my collection, this is an ideal charm for anyone that loves to sew........................"
0,"While this is a very elegant looking tree, I underestimated how large it was going to be. I know it says Petite, but I at least thought that it would be tall enough to hold necklaces on, which it does, but they all touch the ground when they're hanging. For the money, not really worth it. If the normal size one was cheaper, then that's the one to get because at least that one would really be tall enough to hang your necklaces on."
0,The clasp did not work securely and the earrings fell off. I really was unhappy with the quality of the product.
1,I purchased the ea rrings for my daughter in law for Christmas.She loved them.
1,"Most importantly, my granddaughter loved them and since they are pink flowers, they match most everything she wears!"
0,"I bought this to go with a locket I purchased separately. It was a gift, so I don't know about long time wear, but it looked very nice when I received it. It cam in a Tiffany colored box with a bow. So, it was convenient for gift giving. I had done a little online searching for similar products and thought this was the best deal. Thougth, keep in mind this is only 10K, a little lower in gold, but I didn't mind. I spend the better part of my money on the pretty locket that went with it. Overall, it looked very nice."
1,This is beatiful and simple piece of jewelry. It is a good quality and a joy to wear. The shipping is also prompt and safe.
1,I just adore these charms! This one is perfect & high quality - at a great price! It is easy to put on (once you know how) and it added just the perfect touch to my bracelet.
0,"The Sandelli - 14k Gold Onyx with tigers-Eye Drop earrings were too loose for my ear and I lost one of the earrings. As a jewelry maker I know when I'm making a set of earrings, the fish hook have the tendency to slip out of the ear. And should have included the little rubber stoppers with their product. It's a smaill thing to build customer relations and loyalty. I even called and spoke to someone in the store asking to buy one earring if they had such a thing. I was reassured they did have extras earrings and would send me out one. Well I'm still waiting and it's been 3 years. Buyer Beware!!!"
1,This is my favorite belly ring. I loved the fact that the top closure was jeweled as well. It looks very pretty when you have it on and it's very shiny. Definitely my favorite from Body Candy.
0,"I reveived this belly ring as a gift and after one day the bottom jewel fell out. Because it was so inexpensive I am not going to send it back, but I am not going to buy another one. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,I gave these elegant pearls to my son's girlfriend and she loves them. I might buy a pair for myself.
1,This ring is just beautiful! I love it! It is exactly as advertised. PERFECT!
1,"A wonderful ring, silver and turquoise always go together well, but this one has a particularly lovely and elegant shape."
1,"i ordered this ring and when i received it, i was thrilled. absolutely loved it!"
1,Great details! A simple yet Beautiful design. I get many compliments on it when I wear it! Love my ring
0,"Very cheap looking, smells bad. Also, it is almost impossible to contact customer service for return or refund."
1,"I bought this for myself for Christmas. It is gorgeous! I LOVE it, the clasp is beautiful! I would definitely purchase again!"
0,"These earrings were very inexpensive. I would rather have paid more and gotten a pair of earrings with a better clasp. They're also a little too small, but that was my fault for not looking at the specifications closely.I love the style, but I wish whoever makes these could use a better design. They're hard to put on and the metal bends easily."
1,"Blue and Green Multicolor Glass Pendant Necklace. This necklace is beautiful and exquisitely crafted. This necklace is a one of a kind of piece of jewelry that most women would love. In addition, I believe it is good thing that some of the profits from the sell of this necklace will go to helping others."
1,Its a truly very beautiful pendant. I'm very fond of Swarovski Crystal I love the different colors portraited inside the pendant. Very lovely and stunning. I purchase a sparkling necklace to go with the pendant. I wear it often and very happy with the item. The delivery service was quick and packaging was excellent. Thank you so much!!
1,I love the deep color of the pendant - I wish I bought a couple for my nieces
1,"I received this pendant as a Valentine's day gift from my husband, along with the 18"" sterling silver snake chain offered by the same merchant (the chain is absolutely beautiful as well and goes perfectly with this pendant!) Odd as it may be, I have a 2.5 karat wedding ring on and I get more compliments on this pendant! I'm not trying to sound snobby with that comparison, it just blows me away that the pendant is what people always notice! When I wear it, which is quite often, I ALWAYS receive compliments on it, I actually had someone notice it from across the room and walk over just to tell me how beautiful it was! It is an excellent size to wear with just about anything and can be worn with a very formal outfit or just with a normal everyday outfit. My favorite color is purple which is why I was drawn to this particular pendant. After having owned it for a few months now, I have come find that you don't only have to wear it with things that purple coordinates with. It is extremely versatile because though it looks purple, it will actually pick up and reflect the color of almost anything you are wearing! So I've ended up wearing with blue, pink, and green and it matches perfectly. It is indescribably sparkly too! It will reflect light everywhere which makes it even more stunning. I have found crystal pendants elsewhere that resemble this one however they never have the same sparkle and the quality is always far below this one. The back has a silver overlay which is why it is so vibrant and adds to the high quality look it provides. Although I originally thought the price was a little steep for a pendant like this, when you see it in person you will quickly realize that it appears to be much more expensive than it looks! As stated earlier, I wear this pendant often, at least 1-2 times per week and have yet to have any discoloration or need to polish the silver backing or loop hook at the top. The loop by which you attach it to your chain is a good size so it can fit over the clasp on a variety of chains, I have run into a problem with overly small openings on a lot of pendants I've bought which really limits your choice in chains and becomes a pain. All in all I would more than recommend this item to anyone! Buy it for yourself, buy it as a gift...just buy it...I guarantee you won't regret it once it's around your neck and you shine everywhere you go!"
1,"This is a beautiful pendant, especially considering the very reasonable price. I bought it for someone else but ended up keeping it for myself because it was so beautiful! Wore it to an evening event and it was the perfect finishing touch. Very sparkly!"
1,"Every bit as gorgeous as shown. If you want to attract attention, this glittering pendant will do that."
1,Just received my ring. It's just as expected. I wanted something petite to use also as a stacker. A very good buy for the price. It would be a good gift for a teenager too. I love it.
1,This is a beautiful ring. I have gotten compliments on it since the first time I wore it.
1,Looks fantabulous. The eye itself is a lot more detailed than i thought it'd be. &lt;3
0,Only lasted a dozen uses before it stopped hanging on well. I would not bother with this product. In this case quality does matter 100%.
1,Great Gift for my little sister from my son.. . . . . . . . . . . .
1,This was a gift for a family member. They loved it and the quality was very good. Very fast receipt of product. Beautiful on a chain. Would buy from this seller again.
0,This bracelet is of good quality with a nice clasp. It's good looking but it is so small. I have a very small and thin wrist and it is tight with very little slack. It's so small that it's kind of uncomfortable. This seems to have been made for a child but it was not marked that way.
1,"I love it. I was scared it would look totally cheesy and trashy (and in a way I guess it does), but it has a girly appeal and it's COMFORTABLE. I've been wearing it for 5 days straight and it's way more comfortable than the two other dangly ones I own. Great quality.It's perfect!"
0,"The main complaint about these earrings is that they are heavy. I can't keep them in my ears for a long period of time without them hurting. The other problem is they were smaller then I expected, I didn't expect them to be huge but I also didn't expect them to be as small as they were. Other than that, they are a cute pair of earring and different from the standard hoops that we normally see.So, if your used to wearing heavy earrings these might not bother you. However if you tend to wear light earrings or only wear them every once in a while,like I do,I would suggest not getting these."
1,"I'm not usually big on jewelry, being a guy and all, but this is my only ring, and I really like it alot. The one I received looks a bit different than the picture here. The crosses are vertical instead of horizontal, there are two dots also vertical seperating the crosses and no black lines on the top or bottom. Honestly I think it looks alot better than the other version, which is possibly why they began making them this way. It's elegant, simple and goes with anything...I love it."
1,"I absolutely love this ring! very easy to wear (it feels comfortable on me all day), and it has stood up extremely well to daily wear for the last year. I get compliments almost daily also! I want to get one in the other colors that are available too!"
0,I have Zoisite earrings and a pendant that have a good mix of the pink with the green. This one had very dark green stones in it so I did return it. Just not my style.
1,"A very fine piece of art, I did not imagine such miniature pendant. It is reminiscent of russian style of jewelry."
0,"They seem like nice earrings, very glossy and modern, but I'm not comfortable wearing them. The circle on these earrings is almost as big as a dime, but much heavier. I thought I was buying something less chunky; my taste is for smaller earrings. I wish Amazon would publish size measurements."
1,"Love these, they look great dressed up or with your favorite jeans :) Get the matching necklace, they are really nice together !"
0,"I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS RING-IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL ONLINE-BUT IN PERSON IS A FLIMSY-CZ-THAT LOOKS LIKE A VENDING MACHINE RING,IT IS DECEIVING.IF YOU WANT A NICE BAND-DON'T BUY THIS ONE."
0,Disappointed by quality of item. Too fragile and thin and discolored on back of charm. If not returnable I will not be ordering from Amazon or this jeweler in the future. Thank you
1,"wanted a gold 10mm earring, found them here. when they arrived was taken by the beauty. came to me fast., boxed right and very balanced on the post. backs are good and not junk. I paid for what I received and size does matter."
0,"I agree with Celeste...this pendant is not well made and appears to be unfinished. Her pictures are far more accurate than the Amazon views. I didn't pay much for it, so won't bother to send it back. Luckily, it's a Christmas stocking stuffer for my niece and she likes the ""industrial"" look, so maybe she'll think it's supposed to look like this!"
1,"I'm not saying that the stone shines just like a diamond, but all my friends and relatives think my fianc&eacute; has a real diamond. No, they aren't jewelers, but most people aren't. And for $16.99, who can complain about that?But here's what really sealed the deal for me"
1,"I very much so liked this ring, and so did my fiance. I Used this ring to propose to her. It is a very beautiful ring and will most definately refer it to a friend."
1,I really liked the ring but I didn't keep it because it didn't fit right. I will definitely order from Gem Avanue again if I need something. The refund was handled very promptly. Thank you
1,"I was a little worried at first because of some of the mixed reviews and really the whole buying jewelry over the internet thing but, I feel I made a great buy for the price. It looks nice, both peices fit to each other and It came in a nice little gift box. What more do you want? I am very happy with my purchase and Im sure my girlfriend will be too!"
0,"This ring set looks very nice in the picture. But, upon receiving it looks very cheap, and the two pieces do not stay together. Most of the reviews were good, so I thought it would be much better. Won't wear this one much."
1,i love this ring my boyfirend give it to me when he had ask me to marry him
1,This ring was way beyond what i expected. Its absolutely beautiful and i would definitely buy from you again. Thank you so much!!
1,"This ring looks so pretty! But I wouldn't wear it for every day use. It's more like a ""special occasion"" sort of thing. Remember to buy two because this ring is sold separately!! Came quickly in the mail and was the right gauge. Would definitely buy from this company again."
1,"I love this product as it is strong, simple, earthy colors, blends well with most of what one would wear, I have recieved a few compliments on it. Wear and tear will come with time, as I shower with it on sometimes, and most others dont stand up to that kind of wear and tear. A great purchase which I found by mistake oneday."
1,I bought both the necklace and the earrings a few years ago and still love them! The earrings are great with the pendant or alone. They are large enough to provide an interesting complement to any outfit but not too large to detract from other accessories.
1,So far it has not rusted nor fallen apart like other products of purchased from local stores.
1,Love the earrings even though they are a little thin. Product was shipped very quickly and the price was great. Sadly my bracelet that I ordered broke after a few days but was an easy fix. Will buy from this merchant again.
1,"I ordered this ring for myself and am so pleased with it. I have large fingers and thought this ring might be a little overwhelming, but it looks great and fits comfortably, even on bigger fingers. You don't even need any other ring on your hand if you're wearing this one. It's wonderful. Silver insanity is the place to buy from if you want great jewelry at great prices with speedy service."
1,"I have ordered several rings from Silver Insantity, and have never been disappointed in either the price or the quality. I will continue to order from this Seller."
1,This is the fourth or fifth item I've gotten from Nvie Designs and I love it. Everyone compliments me on the jewlery and my friends are always asking to borrow them. This necklace is great for casual or dressy occasions. It arrives quickly as well!
1,"I have to give these necklaces 5 stars. I bought it in all three colors ~ blue, green and amber ( I'd call it brown ). They look just like the pics. For $5 I really don't expect much and am rarely disappointed !! I was really quite pleasantly surprised at the workpersonship (is that a word?).They are cute and fun and $5 ! What's not to love ??"
1,"I am very impressed with the ring's quality, especially for the price. The band is thick and sturdy, and the whole ring appears to be well put together--I am not nervous about wearing it during my usual daily activities. And the size is just right--large enough to be attention-getting, but not so large that it's gaudy. Very glad I got it!"
1,Just loved the ring! Very nice for the price and my Granddaughter just loved it too! I'll have to order her one too. She has a Birthday coming up soon!
1,I have mixed experience with my previous purchases from this company but this one is great. I don't know if I can wear it at work as the ring is kind of bigger and definitely noticeable but it is really beautiful. I simply feel happy when I wear it.
1,"This necklace is gorgeous! It's eye-catching and unique and I love how it sparkles. You get flashes of red, pink, and blue depending on the angle the light hits it. It's a nice size; noticible but not too chunky. I can't speak for the durability because I just got it, but I love it so far!"
0,"I thought I found the perfect gift for my mother for my wedding. However, they lasted one day and fell apart. I was so disappointed and embarrassed that this happened. Though pretty to look at, that is all they are good for."
1,This will go with any color due to the 4 different stones. Much better quality than I expected at very little cost. I'm delighted with it. Fast delivery from a good company.
1,"Lovely drop earrings, my daughter loved them. turns out they are her modern birthstone -- who knew?"
1,if you like moonstone and dangle earings then these are the earrings for you! and the rainbow really shimmers in the light. &lt;3 it!
1,I got these for my best friend's birthday. They were very pretty and she really liked them!
1,"It arrived on time, I was worried that maybe I might have made a mistake. But I put the ring on and I am diggin it. Everyone I've shown loves it."
1,"The product is as advertised, a little smaller than the image may lead you to believe but in the end ideal for use on a charm bracelet. I am well satisfied by the charm."
0,I can't even tell what it is? How is that a UT ring? I don't see anything relating to UT.
1,"While I never have really understood charm bracelets, I know my wife loves hers. This charm was a good match for our Yorkiepoo even though she isn't a full blood terrier. The charm worked perfectly with her bracelet."
1,This set is not only beautiful but practical. Each display can hold a lot of pieces and it looks beautiful on display. It is much easier in the morning to see all of my jewelry instead of digging through piles and wearing the same items over and over.The diplays are sturdy and the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend over the drawer organizers for your everyday jewelry.
0,"Although the product looked good for the most part, there were MANY nicks, dings and chips all along the sides and top of the box. It would be too much of a hassle to attempt a return. Lucky for me the person who I gave it to didn't care too much about the chips. I doubt I will ever buy anything like this online again."
1,"Received promptly. It is a beautiful armoire that any woman would be proud to own. The top came in damaged, however, I called the company and they immediately ordered a replacement from the manufacturer. This company is excellent to work with and I would purchase items from them again."
1,"Great solution to jewelry organization! Roomy, good quality for price, blends beautifully with my mix and sort-of-matching bedroom, combination of antique and thrift store. I just put some organizers in the bigger bottom drawers and have a custom storage unit. This could go in almost any room and fit in - I have an 1857 small farmhouse with no basement or closets and am always looking for versatility and storage. Bottom drawers are large enough for undies, scarves, belts, socks, etc. Highly recommend!"
1,with this purchase. It's very cute. It came in good shape and it was mailed fast.
1,"Since I bought them, I've grown my hair longer so I wish they were larger. But, they are adorable when I wear my hair up. Love all the gem earrings from this maker."
0,"I wish the piece would have stayed shiny longer than 9 months. After that, the Rhodium plating began peeling off. Of course the company that sells the necklace doesn't offer any type of warranty. They told me to take it to a jeweler to have it re-Rhodiumed... Yea, like that'll cost less than the money I paid for the necklace.It was beautiful while it lasted."
1,"This is a very comfortable ring that looks great and is worth the money! I do wish it could be available in larger sizes also, but it is good that it was available in size 10."
1,"I love this necklace. I wanted a key necklace for years, and this one is unique and beautiful. It is large enough to be a statement piece, but light enough to wear everyday. Since I purchased the Mystery Key necklace, I have received countless compliments on it. The necklace is a little long for me, but it is a beautiful Figaro link chain, and looks lovely paired with a small pendant on a 16"" or 18"" necklace for a bolder look."
1,"I gave this to my girlfriend and she loves it. It's one of those ""just thinking of you"" gifts. Very good product and comes in a nice box too. Definitely a good gift."
1,"I was a little hesitant to order this pendant. I've been ordering CZ diamonds from another company that says their CZ's are the best in the world. Well, that's just---absolutely not true. Peora CZ diamonds are excellent quality, beautifully cut, with a whole bunch of fire and depth...very clear and brilliant. I would have paid a lot more than 14.99 at that other company, and would not have found this exact pendant.It's an unusual take on a journey pendant. One of the many things I like about Peora, is their designs are different and unique. I've seen a lot of jewelry, but they have designs, I haven't seen anywhere else. The setting is solid silver and substantial. It looks and ""feels"" so good. The bail is hidden. The pendant is nice size...not tiny. It's tension and semi bezel set, so it is very secure. What can I say? Peora has great quality. The pendant has a rhodium finish. For anyone who may not know, rhodium is a metal in the platinum family. It is lovely. You'll be very pleased with this one. I know I am.I just wanted to add; Journey pendants have meaning. In most journey pendants, the stones are set to weave ""in and out"". What attracted me to the design in this pendant, is the stones start very small and each stone graduates in size, ""on a straight path"". At the point in my life, that what I want; to stay on track while continuing to grow."
0,"its nice, but turns my finger green and none of my good sterling silver does"
1,Great Ring for the price. Shinier than the image but a great all around ring. Scratches easily but that was expected. I bought it for everyday use so I have something to figit with.
1,"It's a nice ring. Looks great. But the outstanding thing is Sabrina - they shipped product out very quickly. I goofed with wrong ring size due to Amazon size chart (definitely, get a professional to size you, although he ended up giving me a too small size too) and Sabrina changed it with no hassles, quickly."
1,The ring was just as the ad had said it would be. I get many compliments. Service was excellent. I sent the ring back for a bigger size. It was exchanged without any problem. I would order from the company again without hesitation.
1,"Very nice. He has a large hand so the 9 mm is perfect. Heavier and better quality than expected for the price. It does run small. Ordered his usual 12 but now ordering a 12.5. Otherwise, Highly recommend!"
1,"My daughter likes the necklace, that was more important to me. I recommend this product as it nice in quality, look and in price too. This looks same as what advertised and quality is also good.Also happy with Amazon delivered within time."
1,"these italian charms are tiny but packed with details of Alice, Cheshire cat and several other characters from Alice In Wonderland."
0,"It is a cute ring, but s small, not much about it - not crazy about it - never wore it. Gave it to my niece. You get what you paid for on this one. Sorry."
1,"very fast shipping and excellent product, me and my dad does Vietnam Cosplay for conventions and memorials he's a Veteran of the war, also in my paintball group we go by ranks and i was just promoted lt.col. for my actions in winning the last match of the year, anyway these are excellent insignias they came fast and were shipped well"
1,A beautiful bracelet. Color is a rich blue.. Sleek design. I've had a lot of compliments wearing this pretty bracelet.
1,I was very impressed with the quality and would not hesitate to purchase other items from the Seller. Their service was also exceptional.
1,"Nice, cute earrings, shaped like a treble clef. Each of the two parts dangles from the post such that every once in a while they produce pleasant chiming sounds."
0,"Fast shipping, perfect condition, I just should have measured the size that I wanted first!"
1,I just received the bracelet and am very impressed with the quality. You never know what you will get buying jewelry online but I took a chance and am very pleased with it. Its a gift for someone and I know they are going to love it!
1,"I bought 4 for gifts last C-Mas. My family loved them! (1 for myself also!) prada Bob comes with the Prada box, tissue and authenticity card. There was a mix-up with the order, so I called Amazon and they took care of it right away. Great service! Thank you Amazon! Debbie"
1,"I got this for my girlfriend, for Christmas, and she has worn it every single day since then. She absolutely loves it! It has not faded or degraded in quality in any way after consistent use for 4 months. I highly recommend this!"
1,I like this pin. It is a little larger that I expected. I wear it on the pocket flap of my denim vest. It is larger than the one I replaced and it looks good. Semper Fi!
1,"This is truly a beautiful piece of jewelry, exactly what I was looking for and at a most reasonable price. In addition, it arrived in the mail more quickly than I had expected it to. I would definitely order from this company again."
1,"I am absolutely delighted with this bracelet and wear it often. Even though it has carnelian stones, they are so understated it's just a bracelet that can be worn with anything - and I have!"

0,"I like my bracelet it works for me, I wear it everyday to work and it is durable. That is why I buy these types of products not for quality of gold, but the durability. I like to wear good looking gold products without spending a lot of money for them and the product last a long time."
1,"I am thrilled with my purchases from American Pearl, but I want to explain why in a way that you can appreciate. This Christmas season I was out to purchase a top quality set of pearls for my wife. She always wanted a beautiful set of pearls. Even when we were looking for engagement rings years ago, she would end up staring at the Japanese Akoya pearls (not that she didn't drool over the diamonds too). This year, I wanted to make her dream come true. Neither of us are fussy about name brands, but we don't compromise on quality. When I am going to make a significant purchase, I like to be an informed consumer (to the extreme in fact). I spent about 2 months learning about pearls, shopping at the best stores (Tiffany & Co. and Mikimoto) and even reading some books on pearls (and visiting forums like pricescope).I have always shopped on Amazon, but shopping for pearls whether Amazon, Ebay or from any online vendor can be risky. There are so many vendors on this site that throw around terms like AA and AAA or AAA+ to describe their pearls. There is no industry accepted standard for grading pearls and merchants are free to set what ever grades they want for their pearls. One merchants A could be another merchant's AAA. Grades are generally useless for comparison shopping. The only way they are relevant is if the merchant is actually benchmarking its grades to Mikimoto (which is the benchmark by which all other pearls are compared). American Pearl's grading system is benchmarked to Mikimoto. The AA pearls that bought from American Pearl are the same quality in all respects to pearls you would buy at Tiffany's or a AA strand from Mikimoto. When you see other vendors selling AAA or AAA+ (a grade they made up themselves) pearls, for substantially less than American Pearl's AA, understand that you are not getting the same quality. You're getting a trumped up strand of what is likely an inferior grade of pearl. I'll put this in some context.Mikimoto mastered the art of culturing akoya pearls over 100 years ago and is still considered the benchmark by which all other pearls are compared. Mikimoto offers very high quality of pearls. The lowest quality pearls sold with the Mikimoto brand still fall within the top 5% of the akoya pearl harvest. To differentiate between the quality of its pearls (and the huge difference in price from its lowest to highest level), Mikimoto created it's own standard for grading Japanese Akoya pearls based on a scale of D, C, B, A1, A, A+, AA and AAA. D and C grade pearls are not jewelry grade and are generally crushed and used for makeup or for other commercial use. At best, they end up as beads in craft stores. Most pearls produced are C grade quality. The next level on the grading system is B quality, which is used in low end jewelry. B quality comprises pearls are typically found at department stores (even higher end ones like Lord & Taylor and Bloomingdale's) and mall jewelry stores. These pearls generally fall in the top 20-6% of the pearl harvest. To expand it's market share, mikimoto created two low end lines of pearls under the brand names Sea Magic (sold at Jared's and other similar stores) and Blue Lagoon (sold at Zales and similar stores). These pearls are blemished and have poor lustre--but are premium priced to capitalize on the brand affiliation with Mikimoto. Aside from the name, these are poor quality pearls that don't meet the standards for sale with the Mikimoto brand. Lustre is the reflection of light off the surface of the pearl. Akoya's pearls are valued on a number for factors, but first and foremost is lustre (the most prized value).Pearl's sold using the Mikimoto branding start with the more familiar A1, A, A+, AA and AAA grades. A1 is the lowest grade pearl that Mikimoto will sell bearing the Mikimoto name. A1 pearls are slightly blemished, and have but have good lustre and medium nacre (skin of the pearl). A is a very slightly blemished and better matched than A1, with good lustre and medium nacre. A+ has very slightly blemished pearls, with very good lustre, and medium to thick nacre. AA is minimally blemished, with excellent matching, excellent lustre and thick to very thick nacre. AAA pearls are flawless, with outstanding matching, outstanding lustre, very thick nacre. In short, AAA pearls is the finest grade of pearls available. AAA strands are also rare. Even Mikimoto stores only have a few strands in their inventory at any given time. Tiffany & Co. is also well known for selling outstanding quality pearls at equal eye watering prices. Tiffany does not have it's own grading system (at least one that it publicly acknowledges), but Tiffany strands are generally AA quality on the Mikimoto grading standard and Tiffany prices its strands directly in line with with Mikimoto AA strands (which would be $5,400 for an 18"" 7x7.5mm strand).I was doing some research to find a true equivalent to Tiffany and Mikimoto AA and AAA quality at wholesale prices. American Pearl is a direct importer of pearls and, through a lot of research, I found out that American Pearl is one of the suppliers to Harry Winston and Tiffany!!! AP also has a showroom on Fifth Avenue in NYC, only a few blocks from Tiffany flagship store and Mikimoto's NYC store and has been in business as a B&M; for over 50 years. If you're in NYC, you can comparison shop Miki, Tiffany and American Pearl all in an hour or two. American Pearl's grading system is equivalent to the Mikimoto system. When you buy a AA strand from AP you are getting a strand that is on par with a strand you would buy at Tiffany or a AA strand from Mikimoto. AP also offers strands that are equivalent to Mikimoto AAA (of the very highest order), but these strands cost considerably more.I purchased an entire set (18"" 7x7.5mm, bracelet and studs) for my wife for christmas. The set was stunning. My wife wore the studs to tiffany's so we could do a direct comparison to Tiffany's strand. It was a dead match!! I couldn't be any happier. AP gave me exactly what I wanted---Tiffany and Mikimoto AA quality for a below wholesale price. I emphatically give American Pearl my STRONGEST recommendation."
1,"This is the second item I've purchased from Peoria. Both have been gold box purchases, and both have come very quickly. I love the look of these earrings. They are small, so they're perfect for my niece who is still quite young.They come packaged inside a plastic bag, which is not lazy or cheap, but prevents the silver from tarnishing. The actual gift box is lovely"
1,These are beautiful earrings. I bought many of these Novica Collection Butterfly Earrings in different colors and they are all very well hand crafted and gorgeous.
1,The color is very vibrant - I think the ring is stunning. The contrast between the silver and the turquoise is lovely.It's a nice weight and very comfortable. I highly recommend it. It does run a bit small though so I'd order a size up.
1,I purchased these for my wife as part of her anniversary present and she loves them. The smoky quartz are beautiful and my wife is happy. Nothing else to be said.
1,"Yes, I am a (rat) snake handler, and bought this to wear when I do presentations with my critters. The details are great! It is not too heavy to wear comfortably, although substantial in size. The hand is a bit gothic, but hey! Another great item from a terrific Amazon vendor..."
1,I bought these for my 13-year old grandaughter for Christmas. I should have bought TWO pair -- one for her and one for me! Very pretty
1,I love these earrings. I like Celtic jewelry and these are nice quality and easy to wear. They look good with everything!Rising Sun - Interconnected Celtic Knot Tree and Roots of Life Sterling Silver Pendant
1,"Got these for my birthday. Bought the pendant, too. They are great to wear together or separately and casual or dress up. My new favs!"
1,"I love these earrings. I think they're really pretty. Definitely not cheap/dinky looking, and definitely made of real silver. In Texas, James Avery is one of the most popular jewelry stores, and this is as good as anything you would buy there. Another good thing - they're not too heavy!"
1,"TheseSterling Silver Celtic Design Oval Dangle Earringswere just as I hoped they would be - shiny, intricate pattern, & good size for everyday wear. I bought them as a gift, but now I want my own pair!"
1,Loved the earrings...they have a nice weight and size. I would order from this line again.
1,"These are wonderful for summer wear, silver is so light to the eyes. The earring though is not heavy on the ear. I love them so much I bought myself a pair in gold. Even bought a pair for my sister!"
1,I bought it as a gift recipient really loved it and I thought it was really nice quality for the price
1,My wife liked these so much she added the companion necklace to her wishlist. The earrings for Christmas and the necklace for Valentine's day. I never had it so easy.
1,"Bought these as a gift for my daughter and she wears them all the time. Just the right size for dangle earrings, not so long as to catch on things. They are very attractive and she loves them. They came in plenty of time for Christmas too!"
0,"Product was nice, writting a bit small, but not much can be done about that. Arrived quickly and was a create price."
1,This Was A Great Item Item For A Gift. It Was Shipped Quickly And It Was Described Just The Way I Got it. The Quality Was Great Toon
1,"Purchased this ring as a gift for my Mother. She said she loves it!! The company did an excellent job with communication, and shipping. It arrived much earlier than we expected. Will definatly order from them again :))"
1,I bought this necklace for my stepmom's birthday and she loved it. I thought it looked very classy on her.
1,"This is a magnificent ring! It is heavy, high quality sterling silver. The dragon is in very detailed high relief with dark interiors and very shiny, highly polished exterior details. The dragon is jealously guarding a polished onyx ball. It is very dynamic and artistic in its design. It wears very well and very smoothly."
1,"BUY!. These are beautiful, well made, and I have received a ton of compliments. I would recommend them to anyone."
0,"The only complaint I have about this is that the bars you turn to hold the cufflinks in place are rounded and short so occasionally, they slipped out. I never lost one, but found myself having to readjust it now and then. They work well with a lot of different color shirts I have and are simple, yet stylish, which is a combination I like.You can find a much nicer pair for the price. They aren't worth $30 to me, but if you can find them for $20, I'd say that's a good deal."
1,I got this ring for our summer vacation. It is so cute! I get so many complements on it. I got it for my index finger. It is a great size for that. I do not think I would like it for my ring finger due to the size and shape. Plus it shows off better on my index finger.
0,"I bought two of this item - the silver heart shaped prayer box necklace - for Chrismas presents. While the heart pendant itself was pretty, it just didn't look right to me on the necklace it comes with. The chain is beautiful but a brighter silver than then antique look of the pendant. So it just didn't seem to match. I ended up returning both necklaces. In my opinion, a better purchase for half the price from this same company is the sterling silver small oxidized ""filigree heart"" pendant. I bought that for myself and love it."
0,"I thought this would be the perfect gift for a Catholic male friend, thinking it was probably a few inches long, maybe an inch wide. When I received it in the mail, it was positively microscopic, only about a 1/2 inch long, very tiny, about as big as my thumbnail. Did I say it was small? This was suitable for a little girl's dainty necklace, perhaps even a charm bracelet. For the price, this was unacceptable, it should have been much larger and more impressive. I'm sure the length was somewhere in the advertisement, but it escaped me entirely, and I was very disappointed. Be warned! Thanks to Amazon for crediting my account very quickly, which makes me happy to continue shopping with them."
1,This ring is delicate and comfortable. It feels great on my hand and looks lovely too.
0,"The bracelet was too small for me to wear, but I don't plan to return it - I will give to one of my grandchildren."
0,"I loved this necklace as soon as I saw it! I get compliments on it all the time every time I wear it! If you love the phoenix, I recommend this necklace! Very nice! My fiance loved it so much, I had to get him one too :)"
1,The item was carefully packaged and was received faster than expected. Would definately buy from this seller again.
1,I love this necklace and I got it before I even expected to get it. I love it. Thank you
0,"The item arrived in a timely manner, but within one week it became cracked and a few days later broke completely in half. It was not from improper use or clumsy handling...it is just a piece of junk."
1,This was a product for myself and I have to say that I am very pleased. The black adjustable cord was something that I did not expect but I do like it because it allows me to be a little more versatile with how I can wear the piece. It does have some weight to it and I must say that I am impressed with the detail of the piece.I have always like the Phoenix and what it represents and how it effects me on a personal level so I can really appreciate the craftsmanship that is put into this piece.I highly recommend this jeweler. I also love the small black pouch that comes along with it to store it. Great buy!
1,Love this necklace. It was a great size and I got plenty of compliments on it. Great price cause I got it on sale too.
1,"A great place to buy from, while the item may have taken a while to get here it's understandable coming from overseas, and you get a postcard that someone actually took the time to write a message of thanks on instead of letting some computer do it automatically. Overall, good service"
1,"This is an extremely beautiful pendant. I was also surprised at its size. It is bigger than you might suspect, but still a great purchase."
0,"I received this pendant yesterday and I can say it's not what I wanted. The size of the pendant is too big to have it around my neck. It would be a good idea to put a real picture with the pendant hanging from the neck to see the size. If I had known it was so big I wouldn't have ordered it and it's a pity because it's really beautiful but for what, decoration?"
1,"I ordered this for my daughter's 16th birthday. She loves it. It has slight scratches on it, but she says it gives it character. It is large, heavy and a perfect gift for a teenager."
1,"this necklace is exactly what I thought it would be. Well crafted, sturdy, large, and absolutely beautiful!!!!! It matches one of my tattoos:)"
1,The product looks just like in the picture! I bought it for a friend as a present. I know he'll love it! :)
1,"I havent seen this, it was a out of state gift for a friend. I was concerned about the size from other peoples remarks. My friend is a medium sized middle aged woman, she loves this and wears it allot."
1,"This was purchased as a gift for my daugher. The August birthstone and symbolic message of the ""journey"" was meaningful to us. Arrived on time, in good condition, and she loved it. Thanks"
0,"I just ordered this pendant for myself. Aquamarine isn't my birthstone but I love blue and wear a lot of it. This looked like a great deal, but when I got the pendant I wasn't sure if I had even received the right item. First of all, the 18"" necklace that accompanies the pendant arrived tied in knots. I'm not sure if it's also 10K gold, but it is so delicate and small that I won't dare wear it for fear that it might break. It was also annoying that I had to spend half an hour untying all the knots. I am not at all impressed or even mildly happy with the chain, but the chain was not the reason I placed the order. More importantly, as far as I'm concerned, the color of the pendant itself is not at all blue like the image on the website.The pendant I received is a very, very, extremely pale blue if I manage to look at it in the right light. Most of the people I showed the pendant to also mistook it for a white gem. It doesn't seem at all to be the item pictured on this webpage. Friends who commented on the pendant didn't think it was an aquamarine and it's mistaken for diamonds, CZs or white sapphires. I re-read the small print on the product page and it does say that the color of the gems may vary from very light blue to evidently what is pictured. I guess I'm going to keep the pendant though. Occasionally you can catch a hint of blue color in my pendant. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. Being as I was born in April and diamonds are my birthstone I guess if it's mistaken for diamonds that won't be so bad, plus what girl wouldn't mind if something were mistaken for diamonds, right? I do have to say that if I had wanted a clear or white gem, I would have ordered the white topaz version of this pendant available on the April birthstone link. (10k White Gold April Birthstone White Topaz Journey Pendant, 18"") The white topaz version is, after all, a little less expensive. The gems I received do not look anything like the blue pendant pictured here, but if the blue color isn't that important to you, it is a very nice pendant, which I do believe to be genuine aquamarine, and worth the $99 sale price. As I mentioned, it is a very pretty piece of jewelry, just not what I expected to receive. I hope that the blue color does occasionally show up when I wear it, but I'm not keeping my hopes too high on that front. (I don't think I would have put up with this lack of color had I paid full price, and would likely have returned the pendant)."
1,"I was very pleased with this lovely pendant because of its high quality and because my wife likes it very much. She wore it yesterday and it really looked good on her. She even liked the nice jewelry box that it came in. It was one of my most successful gifts to her, especially considering the reasonable price. I highly recommend it."
1,"I love this necklace. The color, the size of the stones, the shape. Lays perfectly in place on my upper chest. The stones are not too big and not too tiny - just right in size.This necklace looks much better in person than it does in the photos here, but it's true as another reviewer mentioned that the pictured stone color is not completely accurate - the pictured stones look like a deeper blue, but in reality the blue is clear and true, translucent, a very very pale blue like aquamarine should be; but is it ever alluring! The way the stones curve, it looks so whimsical and graceful.I have fair slightly ruddy skin and it looks nice on me but I think it would be especially stunning on someone with olive or a darker tone skin. (I think the blue might slightly emphasize the ruddiness on my chest I have from past sun damage).This would be a great gift for a daughter or a girlfriend or wife. It is not my birthstone, I bought it because I love this sky blue color. The only down side to it, the clasp is small and not so sturdy, but that could be replaced by a sturdier one, like a toggle clasp or just a larger lobster clasp, and it would be perfect."
1,"I bought this for my girlfriend as a present. It is her birthstone, and she had mentioned liking this stone. I was a bit apprehensive at first, but then I received the necklace and was very pleasantly surprised. She absolutely loves it, and wears it all the time. The necklace is beautiful. I am very glad I made this purchase. It was shipped promptly, and the stone are nicely set, and presented. Great product!"
1,"Aquamarine is my birthstone, so this was a perfect birthday gift. It's very, very lovely, very sparkly and the stones are the appropriately very pale blue of a true aquamarine, not the ruddy blue of blue topaz, a cheaper stone that's often falsely presented as an aquamarine. Any March baby or lover of a quality aquamarine will love this pendant. It's also a good size.The only issue is the uber-thin chain, but most chains that come with pendants these days are like that -- I put all my pendants on one of the three 'good' chains I have so it's not a problem for me."
0,This ring sucks .this is the 2nd ring ive bought from palm beach. And i will never buy from them again.I will also make sure all the people I know know that they dont sell you the ring in there pictures. They never look like there a set together there off meaning made wrong .they dont sit right or look like a real ring set . to much of a pain to return too.
1,"Despite this being only a few dollars, it's very pretty and of good quality. However, the colors of the necklace in real life are actually much darker."
1,"These earrings are great. I can wear them with my work attire or with jeans and a t-shirt. They are not too thick and not too thin. They are a nice sized hoop but a little smaller then I thought they'd be. I wanted something a little bigger, but that's just me ( I'm a big hoop junkie,the bigger the better) They are a wonderful pair of earrings none the less and a must have for any woman who is looking for a nice sized hoop."
0,"I thought this piece looked beautiful and interesting in the picture, but it turned out to be nothing but disappointing. I know it was inexpensive so maybe I should have expected it, but this necklace looks VERY cheap. It resembles some cheap knock-off of a medallion you would find in an adventure movie."
0,"This is a good looking necklace. However, when I hold it at hand, it smells like copper and some paint. I don't like the smell and I have a feeling the paint is not safe for skin."
1,Got this for Christmas for my 18 year old granddaughter. She is into everything Irish and just fell in love with the bracelet.
1,I usually do not wear jewelry and was only looking for Celtic craft tools when I stumbled onto this item. I am wearing it now and absolutely love it. Both the price and quality is extremely pleasing. Thanks so much!
0,"This was a gift for my sister, and she was very pleased with it at first. However, she hasn't even had it for a month yet, and it snapped right in half! I'm very unhappy about this purchase."
0,it was defective - with a large indentation near the edge of the center medalion of the bracelet - and was slightly bent out of shape . i could not possibly give it to anyone as a gift . it should have been a factory reject - maybe it was and they got a lot of these bracelets for really cheap. anyways - i was not about to pay ~$24.00 for a defective piece of junk. i returned it and got my money back - including what it cost to send it back .
0,Didn't expect the product to be quite so malleable. It is very beautiful but I dont wear it much for fear of bending it.
1,"As an Irish woman and lover of Celtic knot work, I am very pleased with this. It is beautiful and very inexpensive."
1,"I love these earrings. They are beautiful and very good quality. Sometimes the endless hoops can be flimsy, these are nice and substantial. Still very light in the ears though. I think I may buy another pair soon."
0,"I received this ring because I wanted to wear it around Halloween time. It got here bright and shiny and sturdy. I have worn it since then but it is really scratched up and the band is a bit squished into my finger. It makes the ring fit better, but it looks like it was in an accident. I'd reccomend this as a piece of costume jewelry, but nothing strong enough for everyday use."
1,I love this ring. It is an eye cathcer and I have received many compliments on it. Thanks Dan's Jewelry.
1,I bought these for my sister for Christmas and she absolutlely loved them!
0,These earrings would be GREAT for a little girl under 13 NOT for a grown woman
0,"The earrings themselves are nice, they say Mother of Pearl but the person I bought them for instantly thought they were a soft stone such as Opal. These earrings are very small though and the ones I was sent were very dirty. I did have some issues at first with shipping as well. I was sent an empty green pouch the first time in the mail. I contacted the seller and they VERY quickly replied and sent me the pair I gave someone."
1,"As another reviewer notes, the picture simply does not do justice to these earrings. They are absolutely lovely. The mother of pearl is so lustrous and pairs beautifully with the silver setting. Delivery was super fast and I was very pleased with every aspect of my purchase."
1,I bought these earrings as a gift for my mother. She loves mother of pearl. She likes her jewelry small and simple rather than big and bulky. She absolutey loved the earrings. I also found a mother of pearl ring on amazon that matched the earrings perfectly.
1,"I was skeptical about buying jewelry over the internet, but the prices were too good to pass up, and Augustina Jewelry had gotten such great reviews that I figured I'd take a chance. I'm VERY glad I did! The string of pearls is beautiful, and the stringing very carefully done. The quality seems excellent - there's no need to spend more.On a side note, Augustina Jewelry is one of the best online stores/sellers that I've ever dealt with. Great customer service every time I've contacted them."
1,"Let me precede this review first by stating that I am a 24 year old male who has never purchased Pearls before in my life. My knowledge of pearls are, at best, extremely limited. Thus, I decided to do a little bit of research on Akoya pearls and the difference between saltwater and freshwater pearls before purchasing this necklace. As this is a gift to my girlfriend of two years for Christmas/New Years, I wanted to make sure she was pleased with this item thoroughly. After purchasing through Amazon at the extremely fair price of $350.00 (supposedly 50% off the marked price, my necklace came in roughly three days later via USPS mail. Very quick indeed.Opening the package up, the first item that dropped out was an appraisal of the necklace by some third party company, and at the price of $2,500. There are multiple things that I find a bit surprising about this appraisal. The first thing is that the value is $2,500; like I said before, I do not know a great deal about pearls. However, To value these at anything near this amount is, to be honest, kind of crazy. I don't know where they came up with this value. As another reviewer said, they might have the currency incorrect. If the Pearls are retailing now at $350.00 dollars, I don't see who would appraise them for $2,500. The second thing that jumped out at me regarding the appraisal is that its no more than a copy of an appraisal. It looks like the millionth copy of the same proposal, stuffed into every box of pearls. In other words, it looks silly and outdated. The third thing that jumped out of me, which confirms my last statement, is that there's a date on the appraisal of 2003. I'm not sure how the value of pearls has declined or inclined throughout the years, but seven years ago was a VERY long time ago when it comes to comparing the value of anything. I think Augustina should seriously take a second to rethink how they want to go about with the appraisal, as it does seem a little tacky and outdated. If the appraisal value was anything near the retail price of the pearls currently, and if the date wasn't seven years ago, I think I would be a little more comfortable receiving this paper with my purchase.The pearls themselves are quite beautiful. They are threaded by silk, per Augustina, and are a shimmering mix of light pink hue. Another reviewer on Amazon mentioned that Augustina should consider removing the ""white"" wording on the item title, as these aren't exactly white. I can confirm this (although I understand the response was given that white pearls of this quality could cost significantly more). But yes, the pearls are a very light pink and seem to take on a glow of their own. Truly beautiful. My only complaints are that 1)the size of the pearls are actually quite small - take note that the are no bigger than 7mm, and judge that on your own. For me, I was taken aback when actually getting them, although when they were on my girlfriend, they seemed to fit quite nicely. But they are certainly not bulky by any means. 2)The necklace box itself is too small for the necklace. This results in double loops in the middle of the box as the ends of the box need to be banded off in order to prevent the pearls from falling out. This detracts from the original presentation of the pearls as a gift in my eyes 3)The gold clasp is kind of cheap looking. It certainly does not look like 14K gold. It looks kind of frail to be honest. Its a very thin metal structure. 4)Not all pearls are in perfect quality. Some of them have defects as you can see scratches on a number of pearls. But anything created by a creature of the sea is bound to not be physically perfect.But despite these negatives, the pearls are of excellent quality. They truly do pick up a glow from the room itself. The light radiates and bounces off of each individual pearl, and the shadow of each pearl bouncing off of one another is a sight to behold. Needless to say, my girlfriend loved the gift, and has received a dozen compliments by those close to her since wearing them. This is the first pair of real pearls she has ever received, and I'm glad I went through Augustina to get them. I believe she is quite satisfied with the gift, and in turn, I am as well."
0,"Wife was very satisfied with earrings which matched the necklace perfectly. This was the first Christmas present that I had purchased with out my wifes expert opinion, turned out that she was very impressed with my purchase."
1,I bought this earrings for my daughter and they are gorgeous on her. I recommend these for adults or kids.
1,"This is a beautiful, sturdy piece of furniture. It's the perfect addition to our bedroom with plenty of room for more jewelry:)"
1,"This piece has a very sturdy build and it is heavy! The doors needed a bit of adjustment, but I was not surprised. You just need to loosen the screw either on the top or bottom on the door to adjust and then tighten it back up. It took longer to get it out of the box than to fix that. The drawers are good sized and plenty of dividers for my bangles, hoops. The necklace holders on the sides hold dozens of items. Beautiful finishes on the wood and hardware and it is exaclty the color I thought it would it be."
1,"After looking for diamond earring jackets for a long time, I found these and was shocked at the great price. They are lovely and well worth $99.00. If you want to enhance your diamond studs, these are the perfect jackets. A great gift for that special someone too!!!"
1,"Great, solid and substantial for the price. Nicely boxed and ""true to color"" as shown in the image ( a true royal blue). Though obviously not sterling, they are nice enough to give as a gift. The ""jewel"" may be hard plastic, but looks like it is genuine stone unless you really inspect it closely. The image does not reflect the sort of ""cat's eye"" sheen that the stones have, which actually add to the appearance of quality. My son loves them and wears them often."
1,"Wow, I was floored when this ring arrived. It's heavily detailed and very well made. The weight is not too much for a woman, and works well for a man.I thought it would be huge, but no...the dragon's head is scaled for finger comfort.WELL worth the price, and a must for dragon-lovers."
0,Ring would be perfect if it looked like the one in the picture...The ring i received looks unfinished ... The side crosses needed more edging... Also the black shading is lacking on both sides and top...i will not bother contacting Amazon or seller for it is not worth my time or money to have shipped back... I will try to add more shading myself... If this ring is NOT the exception i do not recommend it...
1,It fits my index finger perfectly. I have gotten many compliments on it and I have yet to see anyone else with one like it. I have worn it with all types of dress clothing and it really stands out as unique and decorative.
1,I love my ring. It goes with everything. It came to me on time. The service was awesome. Could not ask for anything better. Thank you.
0,"This ring was bulky and didn't fit correctly. Wasn't made well, very large, size 12 or 13."
1,I bought these for my wife she loved them and said they are her favorite piece by far. She wears them often and they show no sign of wear. They were a Christmas gift and are very nice. I was very satisfied with the quality.
1,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR FINGER ARMOR THAN THIS IS THE RING FOR YOU! MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WENT CRAZY WHEN THEY SAW IT. IT TAKES GETTING USED TO (A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE) BUT I LOVE IT JUST THE SAME.
1,I recieved this item in no time at all. I was more than happy with it. I will shop Dan's Jewelers again for sure. I am completly satisfied and cannot wait to order more items from them.
1,"I bought these for my guy who recently got promoted to a field sales position in the financial industry. He wears cufflinks everyday, but didn't have a red pair. he LOVES them and they look great with his suits! I was afraid they might look cheesy because the price was so low, but it turns out they are just a steal!"
0,they fell apart three times on me and they kept replacing the actual hook for the earring. They look pretty cheap though not as nice as they looked on the site
1,"These look wonderful, especially if you have a second piercing as they're not too large and look just right. Well made and sharp looking!"
0,"good look but bad quality, it remain a stains on the skin. it look nice but its not worth it,"
0,Very poor quality--I could not give them to my daughter as I intended. Just junk.
1,"My wife has been--well, let's just say, ""endowed by her creator with certain delightful gifts,"" ones whose size are often measured in letters (wow, what an un-tactful way of trying to be tactful--if my wife ever read this, she'd punch me).I got this for my wife as a Christmas present several years ago; she gets more complements on this ring than any other piece of jewelry she owns. And she's delighted that more people's attention seem to be drawn to this ring than *ahem* anything else."
1,I ordered the bracelet for my daughter's birthday gift. She loves it. I haven't seem it yet. I'm in Afghistan.
1,"Comfortable and plain...If you're into blinding, eyeball-popping ""bling-bling"" this isn't for you; but if you're about subtle, classy, understated elegance, this should fit the bill perfectly. And how 'bout that price??!!!"
0,"We kept tring to order this ring... we must have sent it back about times... it kept coming back in a 2mm width when we wanted 2.5mm. W ended up not getting it at all. The thign is we already have the other one of the set (the girl's ring) and it s pretty great, so we kept it and now we need to find the mathing men's ring. Very disapointing process. Amazn is great and they were cool about giving us our money back, but we wanted this ring and they just couldn't figure out how to give us what we ordered... about 5 times!"
1,"A lot of the problems I've had buying jewelry online is that you never know how sturdy the item is, or how big. This product is by far the best pentacle necklace I've purchased online (and I've bought a few). It is fairly large, with a good heavy chain, and the actual pendant is made of thick pewter and well detailed. This is a good quality product."
1,"I ordered this as an engagement ring for my fiance. He loves it so much we bought another titanium ring for the wedding.Warning, the titanium will scratch and the dragon will fade a bit, but we think the look is very nice and aged."
1,This product was exactly what I wanted. The earrings were described perfectly and I recieved them very quickly. I would do buisiness with this company over and over.
1,"This is another item my husband bought off my Amazon wishlist. I'm enchanted by these earrings! They are good quality silver, a bit on the heavy side, and well-crafted. The lines of the knots are very clear, unlike many Celtic knot pieces. We will be buying more from Silver Insanity in the future."
1,With her cool grace shed upon our face after the long day of blinding light.
0,"Worst seller ever, item not the same as the picture and not notice buyer before shipping."
1,"When I first saw these earrings in their tiny box, I gasped"
1,"This is a very nice, good looking, and durable product. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice bracelet. I've owned mine for about a month or two and I have had no problems."
1,Great quality and very stylish. (Had purchased more expensive brand which I returned.)I definitely recommend this item.
1,I have bought the same bracelet in 2010 for 150 $ on sale from 225 USD. Wow the price is to high two years later for the same product.
1,"THE BEST, I INTEND TO WEAR IT MORE IN THE FALL AND COLDER WEATHER, IT'S KIND OF A HEAVIER TYPE STONEREALLY DIFFERENT.......I LOVE ODD BRACELETS..THANKS"
0,This product arrived in a very short time and is exactly as pictured. It's a tiny little giraffe. My girlfriend loved it! It needs a chain of some sort on which to put the little guy.
0,"The pendant is not 1 7/16"" as described. It is 7/8"". In other words, it is about half the size I expected."
1,The money clip was just what my husband wanted. I was happy with the price and he was happy with the gift. Win all the way around!
1,"This ring is stunning, gorgeous. And you can't beat the price! :-) My fiancee wanted gold, I wanted white gold, obviously I ""won"". But he is more than satisfied with the white gold, this is a very classy-looking ring."
0,"Never got a response to my email asking they change the destination address. Bracelet is not nearly as nice as shown on site, stones have nearly NO color."
0,"these earrings, although frankly costume jewelry, are quite attrtactive and not too heavy for the lobes"
1,"Honestly, I LOVE this ring. I purchased it when Amazon had their 30% off sale and I jumped at the opportunity to buy this. It's very heavy - as platinum should be! And the diamonds are just gorgeous! Although it was very difficult to find someone to resize the ring down, I still saved a lot of money overall. Every jeweler I took it to thought that this ring cost me $4,000, when it only cost me 1/2 the price! All of my friends awed over it and it's big and flashy like an engagement ring should be! Everyone was shocked that it had 15 stones, not 5 and that made them even more impressed. I love the uniqueness of this ring. I don't know where else you could possibly find a ring like this, especially not for the amazing price I purchased it for. And it came with the certificate like promised and it reassured me that I got what Amazon listed."
1,True as advertised! I wear this ring in place of my wedding ring because the center stone on it kept catching on everything. I like this ring because it is feminine without having a big stone sticking up off of it. I bought this ring almost a year ago and I still get compliments on it. Great ring at a great price! Thanks Eve!!
1,"I just recive the hoops diamonds in valentine's day and I was worried because other people's reviews were not good, but I've got to said they are lovely . I 've been doing some shopping around and I didn't find the quality that I saw today ,great buy for the price belive me they are great."
1,"I'm happy with this nose ring. It's comfortable. The silver ball is a bit larger than I thought it would be, but in no way overwhelming."
0,I fell in love with the picture. The ring showed to be sligthly brushed looking. When the ring arrived I was quick to learn the picture looks nothing like the ring. The ring is a bright polish and the yellow gold is barely visiable. I'm very disappointed with amazon for the lack of description.
1,"This is a very nice, simple, classy, ring for men. The white gold is the primary focus and the yellow gold is very subtle - which gives the ring its class. It is polished and reflects what you see in amazon's picture. I am not sure what the other's who gave this one star were complaining about. The picture shows a shiny ring and that is exactly what I got. As far as quality goes - it is a gold ring and is without flaws. If it was flawed I would send it back and wait for the replacement to write a review. Amazon always has great customer service and they want you to be happy.Nice ring!!!"
1,"Excellent quality, I got exactly what I expected, a fine-looking band for a very reasonable price."
0,"I was very happy when I first saw this ring! It fit, looked great on my finger, and then BLAM! there was the defective portion. There was a very noticeable anomaly on the white gold part, a blackish smear that was obviously a defect in the process of dyeing the yellow gold to white. I thought about exchanging it for another one, but figured, &quot;You know, Amazon just recently launched their Jewelry department. If their Quality Control is so bad as to send the customer a defective ring, they don't deserve a second chance!&quot; Sorry Amazon, do better and you just might succeed."
0,"Looks like a wonderful product, but after multiple positive order and shipment confirmations, I got a much belated ""out of stock"" and ""discontinued by the manufacturer"" messages. Yet it is still listed as ""in stock"" on Amazon. If I didn't get the earrings, which I shouldn't have purchased from the same company, ordered at the same time as the neckace, I would have guessed I'd been had. A week after I'm told it isn't available, this item remains ""in stock"" on the Amazon website. Netaya must have genetically flawed monkeys as inventory managers. Too bad, I like monkeys."
1,"This pretty bracelet has so much interest to it, that it cannot but fail to get a lot of notice when you wear it! The colors are very pastel, and would be great with navy blues or dark pinks. Just a couple of caveats"
1,These are the Best cufflinks ! Great conversation piece for sure- my husband works in an italian restaurant so i surprize him with them and they are great for wine lovers and anyone! would reccomend as a gift for sure!
0,I love the look of this ring but I actually bought it to hold medicine. The pill fell out once (lost it). I tried not to get it wet but if it did get a little moisture in it the pill became mushy. So I have a really nice looking ring but can't keep a pill in it.
1,I purchased this ring recently at a good price with the product promotion discount. This is well made and beutiful ring for men.
1,"WELL I WANTED A FOUR STRAND SO BAD AND FINALLY FOUND THIS,AND IT IS A GORGEOUS NECKLACE,I CAN USE THE MULTI-CHAIN ON OTHER PENDANTS,TOO.THANKS AGAIN,GEMWORKS FOR SUCH BEAUTIFUL ITEMS AT GREAT PRICES."
1,"I heard about this stuff on [...] and ordered it right before I got my tongue pierced. I wasn't sure if it was going to get there on time, but sure enough, (I love amazon) It came early! It is the PERFECT size to carry around in my purse, but large enough that it has now lasted me over a week with rinsing my mouth 4-5x's a day! It is in a squirt bottle so you never have to touch your mouth preventing contamination, the formula is AMAZING for healing (it cut the time in half, prevented infection, and soothed it!) and the taste, though awkward at first because it IS a salt water mix, was refreshing and soothing. I always felt like my mouth was clean and tasted/smelled good! I HIGHLY highly recommend it for all new pierced people. If I knew about this I would have bought the spray for my navel ring. My piercer was very impressed at how well I've healed. Stop reading, BUY IT!"
1,"My daughter and I bought this for my husnad for Father's Day. He is a writer and very inspired by its design (Story teller.) He loves it and I love the way it looks on his wrist! Also, the Seller shipped the product very quickly and I was happy to receive the product sooner than expected. Great customer service!"
1,"I bought this as a gift for my hubby. It is beautiful... According to him, it fits like a charm and very comfortable. He abosolutely loves it!"
1,It's perfect. All my earrings are brought from Gem Avenue. I love the necklace and bracelet.Everything is just like the picture.
1,"She being a florida native, I purchased this as a gift to remind her of home. She loved it."
1,This item surpassed even my greatest expectations. It was the perfect size for my petite medical student who graduated in May of 2009 and she was delighted with it.
1,Perfect gift for my mom to remember who son who passed her heart with a piece reserved just for him (the diamond stone). She loves it.
1,"This was a beatiful necklace, true to the picture. My daughter has wore it everyday since she received it. Wonderful to do business with!"
1,"I've had this gold enhancer for a while now. It's a really nice way to dress up a plain gold chain. Also note that the gold is good quality. The color has not changed at all. For those like me that have darker skin, it is a shade of yellow gold that's not too yellow. The finish is shiny, but not overly shiny. Just really pretty, In terms of size, it's about the length of the first digit of my thumb."
1,"looks just like the picture, gorgeous. but the ball doesn't screw on very tightly. have to keep adjusting it to make sure it doesn't fall off!"
0,I liked the look of it a lot but when I wore it the part that goes in bottom infected my belly-button. I took it out after two weeks. I wouldn't really recommend it.
1,"I was very happy with this, it was a very cheap, very nice, gift solution. She loved it :-DDefinatly a good buy."
1,I ordered this pair of earrings to go with another Eve's Addiction item and was ever so pleased when I rec'd them. I ordered several itmes from Eve's Addiction and these earrings are by far my favorite.They are long and very pretty! Worth the $$!
1,I love this bracelet. It's simple and elegant and wears nicely on the wrist. No pulling arm hair; it's very smooth. I'd buy from this company again!
0,"I was disappointed with these earrings, the setting is not like the picture. The setting looks more like wires holding the stone, it is not nearly as substantial as the photo shows."
1,"I love this belly ring, and so does my boyfriend.Now if only the word was spelled downward, so guys didn't have to turn their heads to the side to read it..."
1,"I was a little wary purchasing jewelry from the internet, because I had browsed other reviews on similar moonstone necklaces (though they were not from Novica) and saw many complaints about the backing being hollow or the metal being cheap and looking like something one could acquire from a candy machine...This article of jewelry, however, was absolutely fabulous! It came in a timely manner and the creators even sent a short thank-you note on a lovely postcard native to the area in which the jewelry is crafted. One of the best things about this piece is that it looks hand-crafted but is not cheap in appearance. The stone is breathtakingly beautiful... it almost seems to change colors at times when worn against the skin, but you can ""control"" the color intensity of the stone by wearing it so that it hangs over your clothing - the colors are most vibrant then. I've gotten many compliments on it and the ability to adjust the length whenever I want without worrying about clasps is also an excellent feature (it has a little metal clamp that clutches the leather cord near the ends, which are securely knotted - to adjust it, one simply has to slide the metal clamp forward or backward).All in all, I highly recommend this product. The leather cord allows one to wear this necklace with more casual clothing, but it's certainly adequate for a fancy evening out as well! Once I recover from the payments my new car demands, I'll definitely be browsing through Novica's other products."
0,Beautiful item but I had to return it because my ponytail was too thin (postpartum hair)--it just fell right off. Was afraid to keep for later for the price. Great service from Silver Insanity though.
0,I received my bracelet and wore it a total of 2 times and the bracelet snapped a part -- losing most of the Gems that fell apart on the street.Was never able to recover not even half of the gems to restore this bracelet.
1,This is a VERY nice necklace. its length is good and the bright silver color is amazing! No tarnish or and crimps in the chain. AWESOME BUY!
1,I bought this to wear with a big silver locket that has an antique look and needed a heavy looking chain. This one is very pretty and it shipped to me super fast. I would buy it again!
1,This chain was affordable and arrived fast. Chain is very nice and just dainty enough for a girl yet strong enough to hold a heavy charm. I bought this to hold a silver saint medal given to me by best friend for Christmas. It's perfect.
1,"I know there are ratings for this product that are not as favorable, but I truly love this necklace. It isn't as heavy as another rope chain that I have, but it fits the pendant much better. Others have commented on its lightweight, but unless you are planning on wearing it all day and night, around babies, or other occasions which would cause it to be constantly pulled on (and I don't mean a light tug), it is heavy enough for wear."
1,I was very impressed with the quality of this chain. It is gorgeous and looks great with my favorite pendant!
1,"The 2mm Sterling Silver 24&#34; Diamond-cut Rope Chain Necklace is just as described and it looks beautiful.The lengh is just right, too."
1,This necklace was a perfect fit for my mother.The chain that came with the Dragonfly pendant wasn't big enough at 18inches.So IOrdered this 24 inch necklace. Its nice and sturdy . Love it!
1,"I bought this for my husband and he thought it was gorgeous! It is super shiny, made sturdy and stunning!"
0,"I thought it was my best buy for I read a good reviews about the item. Until the day it was delivered. When I opened the box, saw a small piece of metal ripped off from the chain and there's just a piece of metal holding the both ends of the chain. Moreover, it is not sterling at all. I wore it for just a few days and its not gleaming anymore. A diamond cut usually gleam. This is NOT. I wish I could return the item but it is just a waste of time of sending this back and wait for the refund or replacement for more days. I am not just happy with the item."
1,"I FEEL THIS NECKLACE FOR THE LENGTH AND THE QUALITY WAS AN EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE PRICE, AND I WILL SHOP AT THIS SITE AGAIN."
1,"Beautiful chain, bright & shiny. Bought one of their lockets too, also very pleased. I almost felt like they were waiting outside my door after clicked on the ""place your order"" button. Awesome service. Thanks!"
1,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND ALSO A LETTER M FOR MY 2 SONS. THEY WERE PERFECT,NOT TOO BIG OR SMALL. THEY SPARKLE JUST ENOUGH, I WOULD SIZE IT COMPARABLE TO A NICKEL. I IT PAIRED WITH A 2MM DIAMOND CUT ROPE CHAIN. IT WAS A GREAT GIFT MY SONS ARE 16 AND 26 AND THEY LOVED IT"
1,"I ordered this letter pedant for myself, its even more beautiful in person than on the picture."
0,"The clasp on this charm bracelet held well, too well. When I tryed to open it the back of the clasp fell off."
1,"This chain was beyond my expectation, the links are big enough and is top quality. Although I knew that it was 2mm I still did not expect such good quality.It is worth it."
1,This has become one of my favorite rings; the colors are just as they are pictured. I love multi-gemstone jewelry; I wear it often and I get so many compliments on this!
1,"Very happy with this key chain. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lovely and well made. It was given as a gift, recipient was thrilled. Recommended."
0,"These earrings are adorable. Too bad they look nothing like the picture. At all. The earrings I received were domed and had no crystal elements, as opposed to the flat-topped earrings in the picture."
1,"beautiful calming stone, great for the price. I wear it just about every day."
1,I recieved the Sterling Silver Peridot Gemstone Band Dolphin Animal Ring. I was quite impressed with the quality of the ring. And very pleased with the low price. Having a genuine peridot was an added bonus. I would recommend this ring to any buyer if you like Dolphins.
1,This ring is a very pretty ring for my daughter. I think she will love it and it was packaged in a pink box with a bow. That was a pleasant surprise. Fast shipping too!
1,"Beautifully carved sterling. Came a little bit tarnished but once we polished, itwas as stunning as the image shown. Nice and thick, not at all flimsy. Very pleased."
1,"I love this ring. It looks exactly like the picture and makes a great index-finger ring. It also runs true to size (for me, at least) no issues with it running small. It doesn't slip and slide and it adds a little something different from my other rings."
0,"The ring ran small. I tried getting a hold of the people who I ordered it from, and they never returned my email."
1,"I am very pleased with this beautiful ring! I wear her almost everyday! I am obsessed with mermaids, but only the pretty ones. She is beautifully detailed, with nice features, breasts, hair, scales and tail. I have meaty fingers that usually run about a 9 1/2 but with this ring I needed a 10."
1,"What can I say, I like daisies! If you do too, you will not be disappointed with this charm!"
1,"This ring is very special. I bought it for my husband and many people have noticed and commented on its beauty. It is such a lovely and shiny silver and the turquoise wolves make a beautiful contrast. This is a unique ring and it is interesting because of the Native American component,being that it is a story-telling ring."
1,This is a great ring....and the service and delivery are first rate. I would definitely recommend this ring and Taos Trading Company to those who are looking for quality products. The staff there are great and very helpful. I will be a repeat customer.
1,I got a quick response when I inquired about when a size 7 would again be available. The sales person even E-mailed me when it came in and offered to hold one for me. I also love the ring!
1,"this is such a pretty ring! I first ordered it in a 9, I wanted it for my pointer finger. I've sent it back and ordered the 8. They don't sell 1/2 sizes. That is kinda annoying because the 8and 1/2 would have been perfect! But, I can wear this on the intended finger if I'm not hot. It has a great shine and the swirls are nice. This company is easy to work with... They need to offer 1/2 sizes!"
1,"I haven't taken this necklace off once since it came. It's absolutely beautiful and everyone wants to know where I got it. It's much sturdier than it looks and can handle wear, which I appreciate. I would definitely recommend this item."
0,"When I first received the locket in the mail (gift for my girlfriend) I thought it looked beautiful. However, upon opening it, it seems that there isn't much possibility for insertion of a picture. Most lockets have an insert in which one could trace the outline upon a picture to cut it out and fit right inside the locket. This one offers no aid in fitting a picture inside and the bracket on the locket is quite loose. I don't recommend buying it if you plan to put a picture inside."
1,"I was shopping for a platinum chain so my wife could wear her rings on it at work. She washes her hands a lot, and the soap gets caught underneath the rings and irritates her skin somethin' fierce. Anyway, she LOVES the chain, but it is WAY too small to hold her rings.So be careful buying this type of jewelry on-line. The chain was great (hence 5 stars) but I misjudged the size."
0,"I had to return this pendant because the quality was very poor. The photo makes it appear to be made of thick and heavy silver, but it is actually thin and cheap. I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it. WARNING"
1,"Como siempre escribo en Castellano para mis amigos de habla hispana.Recomiendo estos zarcillos para una bebe, el tama&ntilde;o es el mismo que el de la foto, ella tiene 6 meses y se les ven excelentes.Ademas como tienen seguro de tornillo por detras evitas que ella los pierda, ademas a mi hija le encantaron, creo que son muy comodos."
0,"I had high hope about this product, especially after reading good reviews. I have similar earring from high end store in white gold and they don't have in yellow gold, so I bought this one from Amazon. The earrings looks really cheaply made. It looks more like ball head pins for sewing and it's really sharp but I think, what a heck, it has safety back, so I put it on and I wear it for the night. Guess what? The next day my ears are in pain. I guess because it's so sharp in the screw area, it cut my earlobe! It take 3 days to heal my earlobe. Right away I took it out and returned it! I can't believe it! Good thing it's me, not my baby!"
1,These earrings were exactly what I wanted. They do not bother me when I sleep and they are not coming undone.
1,"I thought I ordered a size 5 ring, but I got a larger size. I returned the ring for the correct size."
0,"While the price is low, it's not nearly as low as the quality. The item looks like something that you would get from a 25 cent machine at the enterance to a grocery store. The mold marks are painfully evident, it doesn't look like the manufacturer put any effort into cleaning it up after it came from the assembly line, and it just screams ""massed produced shlock."""
1,"I have purchased over 100 of these bracelets for friends and employees. From 17 years old to 82 years young, everyone loves them. They are easy to put on and take off, does not matter what size your wrist is. They are are reasonably durable, you just can't rip them off your wrist and expect them to stay together. I wear 6 or 7 of them all the time. I have the double and triple beads. They also come in single beads. They always look nice, never tarnish. Shipping is quick!"
1,my daughter at college misses her cat terribly so i sent these to cheer her up. she loves them good quality
0,"I returned this ring because it was too small. Your return department told me the box was empty when recieved. Well, it was not empty when I shipped it back. Answer from your office was something like, ""OH well- sorry!"" I do not understand how this can happen and I am just out $200+ dollars. I am VERY disatisfied. Except for Kindle books I will not order from you again.14k White Gold Diamond Heart Ring (1/10 cttw, H-I Color, I2 Clarity), Size 8"
0,This pendant is very small and not very exciting. Not really big enough to be a pendant I think.
1,My sister has an adorable Havanese puppy and she absolutely adored the paw print charm. I received it in record time and ordered 3 more!
1,"My Fiance and I picked these rings out as I love silver, he loves gold and when we saw these they just fit both our styles so well.The sales team were very friendly and the shipping was very quick and straight to the door.The rings were in lovely little pouches and the rings themselves were more beautiful than we imagined.I'm a very happy customer."
1,I am so happy with this purchase-the pearls are beautiful and the chain is easy to put on.I really like the choices given in the lenght of the chain.I'll be back!
0,"I bought these for the screw-on backs because the regular backs sometimes came undone during sleep. These are very handsome and never come undone. I actually like them better than the 7 mm earrings I bought earlier.UPDATE:These gold round balls are hollow & the screw-on backs so tiny that it's difficult to screw them on to the earring posts. I ordered these to replace a 7mm pair whose screw-on back came off after a relatively short time. I ordered these as a replacement, but couldn't put on myself [my very arthritic hands are deformed and insensitive]. For awhile my husband would put them on for me, but then said it was too difficult, so I had to stop wearing them. They are so light-weight that it would take at least 22 pairs to achieve the minimum pennyweight to sell them as scrap gold."
0,This Necklace is very small. The necklace looks like a necklace for a small child not an adult. While it is pretty it is just not made for an adult. The box it comes in is plastic inside like cheap costume jewelry. If a young child bought this for there mother I'm sure the mother would love it. But adults this is just not a gift you would feel proud giving.
1,Item arrived in excellent condition and was package very well. I'm very impressed and would recommend seller to anyone. A+++
1,"This is way more better than what I expected, I will make sure that I will keep the senders information to make other orders,"
1,Thank you this arrived in a timely manner and it was just what we needed for the wedding. We really loved the ring. Thank you. Great job.
1,"I purchased this ring as a substitute for my platinum wedding band, which I lost. It came nicely packaged and polished, and looks great with my engagement ring, even though the different metals are slightly different colors. I would definitely purchase from this seller again."
1,"It's a little rounder than I would like, but it's true to the picture and is pretty much what I expected. Quick shipping!"
1,I buy all my silver jewelry from this place! They are fast and there quality is impecable! I love them!
0,Service was great. The ring does get scratched up pretty easily so it will not keep the high gloss shine over time.
1,"I know these are wedding bands, but I didn't get two for that purpose. I got two of these nice-sized sterling silver bands to use as stack bands with my other rings. Gives a really nice look on either side of another sterling silver ring such as a solitaire. Lots of versatility. And, if you are so inclined, you can use them as a wedding ring."
0,This ring is nice but runs very small. I ordered a size 7 which I have another thumb ring in that size. This one didn' fit while the one I already have fits perfectly. What's up with that?
1,I love this ring. I wear it on my right pointer finger and it is so shiny and light I forget I'm wearing it. I might have to get another one for my left thumb.
1,"I love my ring from Sabrina. I have gotten many compliments, however I have bought 2 other rings a while back & have been told how attractive the jewelry looks. I'm very pleased with my purchase once again."
0,The little extras - like the clouds just fall off. It's not put together well at all. The jewlery is super junky.The pony is cute. I don't even think this is worth the $7.50 it is now!
0,"The quality is poor, the clouds keep falling off, cheap jewelry. The pony is cute but you can purchase it without having to get the jewelry box."
1,"I know this is supposed to be a Celtic knot...but everyone I meet tells me the same thing...it looks like a butterfly within a heart! I ALWAYS get compliments on these earrings, they are lightweight and dont catch in my long hair.Beautiful, priced well, and from one of the BEST sellers on the internet"
0,"Product was recieved with a large portion of the chain jet black with tarnish. Sent several e-mails out for return inquiries and have yet to recieve an answer (15 days since first e-mail) Terrible company, would not recommend purchasing from company at this time..."
1,"The product shipped from silver insanity quickly - got here in just a few business days. No problems with the product except that it's a very bright silver. That's not a bad thing, just not my taste. I posted a product image of what it looks like now that I've darkened it using the hard-boiled egg method. It's great now!"
1,"Bought this for my (Irish) significant other, she loved it. The necklace actually combines 2 common Irish symbols. A good buy, and it seems of quality material and construction."
1,My mother who passed away in 2007 was really close to my youngest child . Roni did everything with grandma . when grandma passed away Roni took it the hardest . still feels the pain of grandma not being here . so i thought this was a great way for her to honor her grandma and for her to know no matter where she goes in life grandma is in her heart on in her memories
1,"I bought these studs to wear for everyday and I also got them as an inside joke. My PB (dog) loves to lick my ears and has a habit of getting the backs lost. These earrings may be small, but they have a nice sturdy post and backing to them. I've found that I really like them, no strike that, I love them!"
1,These came shipped beautifully and what a great value for what you get. Adorable!!!
1,Bought this for a gift and the recipient LOVED it! excellent rendering and nicely centered on the charm. Easy to install.
1,"I wasn't sure I was ordering the correct charm for my Italian charm bracelet, but gave it a shot. Perfect fit, exactly what I wanted.The product arrived much faster than I expected and was in great condition. I WILL be ordering from them again!"
1,"I purchased this ring for a friend who collects elephants. Of course the elephants on the ring are nicely detailed and set off in silver while the bands of the ring are electroplate gold. The ring looks like it cost far, far more than the paltry $20 charged. I am very pleased with the purchase and so was the recipient. I would suggest making this ring in some larger sizes for men."
1,"I am an elephant fanatic and, when browsing amazon for other elephant related items, excitedly came across this gem. I don't typically buy myself rings as I tend to lose them no matter how hard I try not to. But this has not left my finger since I received it in the mail just a few days after order. It is a beautiful ring and I absolutely adore it.Also, within the package, I received a free gifted shell necklace and polishing cloth along with the Palm Beach Jewelry catalog and am definitely going to order from them again because I am more than pleased!"
1,"The ring arrived on time and was the one shown in the picture. Inexpensive, nice-looking, and my girlfriend likes it!"
1,This fits well and is as described in the picture. It is very clean and matches the necklace I bought to go along with it.
1,"Bought two of rings one for my mother and one for my father... They love them, It was a great anny present. The rings are exactly how the picture shows, So perfect!"
0,"Its ok for the price, but doesnt come with papers or any avaluation, good size stone but the gold is very thin, not like the photo."
1,I ordered these to wear to BBQ contests - they got here VERY quickly and I'm VERY pleased with them!
1,"Absolutely wonderful--bought it as a pinkie ring, and it fits perfectly. The design is raised enough to be eye-catching, but not so high that it catches on things when you are working around the home or yard. Just love this ring!"
1,"I received this ring today, 2 days ahead of the scheduled delivery date, and I instantly fell in love with it. The photos don't do it justice, it is just beautiful. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves celtic-inspired jewelry or as a gift for someone that does. It's beautiful!**Edit**My mother likes this ring so much and always comments on it, so I purchased one for her upcoming birthday. She is going to love it!"
1,Thank you for such great items at an affordable value! My daughter and I were very pleased with our rings. Thanks again! Great service.
1,I love the ring it is dainty and got to my home very fast. Worth the money in deed. If I can find more like this at the same price I would love to h ave them all. But my husband says you only have 10 fingers. I keep trying to tell him it's a women thing.
1,"My wife and I ordered this for our youngest daughter and put it in her stocking. She discovered it Christmas morning. She had previewed it online but had no idea she was getting it. She loves it and wears it all the time. Needless to say, she is thrilled!"
1,I received this ring in about 2 days and I think it's great! It fits perfectly and I love the intricate detail of the heart and knot. I will buy from this seller again!
0,"This really is a pretty ring. I wore it almost nonstop for a few months at least. But perhpas because I rarely took it off, the ring is no longer circular or even oblong. You can't tell when it's on because the Celtic design covers the top of my finger. But when you take it off and set it down, it's clear that the ring has gotten squeezed at various points out of its circular shape. Granted, I rarely took it off for those several months I was wearing it. Then again, I wasn't lifting weights while the thing was on either. So take this particular negative aspect as you will. Ultimately, for the price and the rare larger sizes, I don't regret my purchase at all."
1,"This is a very nice ring for the price. I ordered 2 different rings for my left ring finger. They both fit nicely, but to wear them both I am wearing this one on my right pinkie. It's a very delicate looking ring and I love it! Looks better in real life than it does in the pictures! The shipping was so much quicker than they had indicated! Thanks Amazon and Silver Insanity!"
1,I was a bit worried that the ring would look too small on my hand (I wear a size 13) but it was perfect! I am very pleased with the quality and overall very satisfied. I will definitely order from the seller again.
1,"My boyfriend had bought me this ring along with the Celtic Heart Pendant Necklace Amazon sells for my anniversary gift. The picture does show that it looks rather bulky, but once it's on your finger it's the perfect fit. The details in the picture is exactly what you get and it's a gorgeous ring. I haven't taken it off since the day I got it in the mail. The ring is very sturdy and the entire ring is sterling silver. I simply adore this ring and I do insist if you want to buy it, it's well worth the money!"
1,I got this as a gift along with other things on Valentines day. It is so light and comfy. The design is delicate and pretty. We were trying to save money on presents this year. I think I have the better end of the deal since this is soooo nice for the price! :)
1,"Have bought this ring twice, the first time it was too small. It is very pretty. The heart and knots are not chunky looking, but instead are very feminine. I use it as a toe ring. It has bent out of the round, but this was a plus for me because now the decoration stays on the top of my toe instead of sliding to the underside. I never take it off."
0,"It's a pretty ring and very dainty, the price was right but the only problem which is a big problem to me is that it turns your finger green. If it wasn't for turning your finger green it would easily be 5 stars but unfortunately I could only give it 2"
1,I bought this for my 13 years old in size 9. It looks decent and cute. I love how the hearts overlap. the band is decent thickness and this is simply a cute ring. I would recommend it.
1,"This ring is not only gorgeous, but it's delicate. Not as big as it seems in the picture. Exquisite for the price, and was shipped promptly. It arrived in a black velvet bag. It's beautiful. Would buy from this seller again."
1,Still wearing the pinky ring with the trinity knotFinally have a pinky ring that does not turn my finger green
1,I absolutely love this ring! This ring fits perfectly and is simply gorgeous. Everybody complemented the ring and asked me where I got it. I would definitely buy it again for a present.
1,"This ring is perfect. I have large hands, but very thin fingers and this ring isn't too small to look odd on my large hands and it isn't too large to overpower my thin fingers. It's beautiful, just like the picture. It came quickly, and was in a small black pouch. Very good price for what I got. I wear it every day and have even gone swimming and showered with it on and it has not turned my finger green (somethig I was worried about) Alltogether this is a great buy!!"
0,"I'm a little surprised that all reviews are 4 or 5 stars right now. I was quite disappointed with this ring. It is pretty, but it is so lightweight it feels almost flimsy. I had intended to give it as a gift, but no way. It has the feel of a ring that came in one of those plastic bubbles from a 50 cent toy machine in the supermarket - so back it went. Too bad - the design is nice and it is shiny silver. And I wear a lot of silver jewelry, so I generally have reasonable expectations in this price range. This one didn't live up to them, unfortunately."
1,This ring is beautiful. I got this ring for Christmas and I could not be more pleased! The ring is delicate but sturdy and will go with whatever I am wearing.
1,I was very pleasently surprised by the quality of this ring. I am in the process of weightloss so I will be buying this ring again in a smaller size. It is that beautiful!
1,it works very nice & is very durable & could youes it with any outfit
1,"This ring is more dainty than I expected based on the picture, but it is a good size and I absolutely love it! It's so pretty. It was true to size for me, and I look forward to wearing it everyday!"
1,"I absolutely love hearts and celtic knots and when I saw this ring I just had to have it! My mom got it for me for Easter and I haven't taken it off since! I love it, the quality is great and it is just perfect!"
1,"This is a sweet little ring! It is perfect, does not sit too high, so it does not get caught on things.Very pretty. Shipped quickly, like dealing with Silver Insanity!"
1,"I bought this ring online, something I never do, but it came out perfect. Nice fit, and it is beautiful! If you love celtic jewelry, it is lightweight and feminine, simple yet eye-catching. Any excellent value for the price."
1,I bought this ring because I loved the design! Looking at the picture it looked like it would have more bulk to it than it actually does. I have big fingers and finding a ring that is beautiful and feminine is difficult for me. This ring gives me that. I have recently become engaged and we plan on using this ring until he finds something that he believes will top it.
1,The ring is small but it is real and looks really good. It collects oils and dirt quickly so make sure you have silver polish and cleaner.
1,"I ordered 3 of these for myself and my daughters, (23 and 14) and they really liked them. The design is really pretty. So far we have had no issues with them. The shipping was really fast."
1,"This is a very pretty, delicate ring, and the quality is very good considering the price."
1,This ring is fantastic! It looks just like it does in the picture! I would highly recommend this if you wants some type of Celtic Jewelry.
1,"Love it, its very cute. Thinner than I thought it was going to be but still good. Size is right also."
1,"this ring is beautiful and very well made,,, i am completely satisfied and would recomend this ring to anyone ..."
0,I bought this as a gift for my sister and it broke. The band is too thin (palm side) and the material was too weak.
0,Not happy! The reason is becuase my finger turned green in less than 24 hrs after having it on my finger.
1,"I love this ring, great quality not to big/small. Although I missed judged the size, and had lost some weight it is now to big to wear. I have a ring sizer on with the ring and it still spins around my finger. I may get another ring (same one) in a smaller size."
1,"I bought this in a size 7 and it fits perfectly for me. I wear this ring almost every day and it still shows no sign or wear and tear or tarnishing.Excellent detailing, true to size, and durable!"
1,"Attention all silver consumers! The products sold by Silver Insanity are exceptioanl. I have purchased a total of seven spining rings and they are of the highest quality. The rings are exceptionally crafted, the detailed designs are very original, the spinning is smooth, and the weight of the rigns is perfect. I only hope that this company comes up with new desaigns because I will, without a doubt, continue purchasing my rings through them. Furthermore, the customer service is excellent. Twice I ordred the wrong size rings and it ws no problem to have them replaced. The company seem to be well organized in record keepiing and truly eager to satisfy the customer. They are fantastic!"
1,Beautiful! Very delicate and the sparkle is subtle but eye catching. Wonderful addition to my jewelry collection.
1,"I just received this ring this morning and it is outstanding. I was worried that it would have black pieces all through it. I am no expert, but I did not see one black mark. It is a little cloudy, but overall looks great. If you are on a budget and need a really nice ring, buy this."
1,"I highly recommend the seller,Jewelry Days, of this beautiful piece of jewelry which I wear everywhere. Platinum is an extremely durable precious metal and one of my favourites."
1,"Thank you for this unique product. Great seller, fast shipment and product as described. Would recommend this sellers to others! Thank you much!!"
1,It is better than in the picture. I love it...my son wears it with a black cord around his neck and it is spectacular. Worth it!
0,"To be honest, I got this on Amazon's 70% off Summer Blowout, so the price was under $10. It's a pretty ring, with stones that are a deep orangey-red. It's actually very pretty, just not the true or dark red I expected. The setting goes a bit too far on either side of the ring, which can make it a tad uncomfortable to wear, as the setting itself sits a high on the finger. This means it doesn't lie flat against your finger, which is just fine as long as the setting doesn't extend to the area between your fingers. I have relatively small fingers, so perhaps it would not be an issue for larger ring sizes. Overall, I'm happy with the ring, but it won't be getting quite the wear I thought it would due to the color and fit issues."
1,would still love to have this ring at the time i did not have the money to order it is there any chance i could still get it at a later date or from some other web site? hopefully you can help me get this ring. thank you
1,"I sent these beautiful heart drop earrings to my daughter who had just started her freshman year at college in NYC. They are beautiful, quality earrings, and apparently ""cool"" becauses she wears them a lot!"
0,i used these earings and 2 weeks later the bezel or should i say stone fell out............................ ghper ropej-e rrogjrw0jg
1,"This ear cuff is just beautiful and so easy to wear. I have long hair, so sometimes the ear cuffs get caught in my hair. Not this one. It is just beautiful and I love it!"
1,"Wow!!! this ring is true to the photo and description. Very original in design, quality made! I love it and other people that see it too!"
1,"This is my new favorite piece of abstract jewelry. The craftsmanship is exquisite and obviously of sound quality. I'm still surprised I bought this at such a reasonable price, it's well worth the cost. If you wear a half size, I recommend buying half a size larger and gently tightening the band to the desired fit."
1,"It is a beautiful ring. The silver is shiny and thick/strong, and the stones are clear, bright and lovely colors."
1,I just opened my ring box. To my dismay the inside stone is missing or broken off. I have never worn the ring. I immediately put it back into its box and it is already in the mail being returned. Hopefully a replacement will arrive in a timely manner without issue.Will keep you posted.......Update:Not only did the seller send me a replacement ring within days they refunded my original transaction.I am VERY happy!
1,"My mother loved loved LOVED this ring. I got it for her for her birthday and it is so ""her style."" She's been wearing it constantly!"
1,I love this ring. It is great because I can wear on different fingers because of the way it is made.
1,"I'm absolutely in love with this ring! Great design, great idea, and an excellent execution! I'm looking forward to add some more Ian and Valery jewels to my collection."
1,"I received this ring four years ago as a graduation present. I still wear it on a regular basis, and have since gotten the matching pendant and earrings. The design is beautiful and simple, and the jewelry has stood up to the abuses of everyday wear by a careless teenager. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
1,"This ring is absolutely stunning and so very unique! I've never seen anything like it. Very well made, and comes from a great vendor!"
1,"I adore this ring, the design is wonderful and the colors are magnificent. The band is fairly heavy, though, and I feel that it is best worn on an exterior finger, and definitely not next to a finger also wearing a ring. All around a fantastic piece."
1,"This is a really nice ring and looks exactly like the photos, excellent quality.I would like to know what Certified stands for though as I saw no certificates with the product. I hope it ""is"" really genuine amber. Thanks"
1,"It's hard to find a interesting design for amber, that plays on the colours and shape of the stone. This ring is absolutely superb and I love it to pieces. It sits a bit chunky on your finger but after a while you just get used to it. The best buy I've made on amazon! Thankyou!"
1,"I've had my eye on this ring for a while. Finally, last weekend I decided to buy it. It arrived yesterday, and all I can say is WOW. It's absolutely gorgeous. The colors are beautiful and play the light very well (just wait 'til you see it in natural sunlight). I wear it on my middle finger and it's comfortable. What a unique piece of jewelry. Don't hesitate to buy this ring--it's gorgeous and the price is right."
1,"I've been watching this ring for a long time. When the price dropped I jumped on it. I'm happy I did. I specifically bought it to wear on my index or middle finger, I'm glad I did because its a little bulky for me to be wear on the ring finger. I haven't tried it as a thumb ring, yet. The day I ordered the ring I got an email saying it had been shipped. I received the ring the next day! Bonus! Great ring and fast delivery."
1,"This was my favorite ring. I lost it. I hope some day I will find it but it has been missing for quite a while.The ring itself is a bit thick, but that's the only negative thing I can think of. The stones are bigger than the rings I normally wear, but not too big. It's not easily adjustable, but I consider that to be a good thing. Rings that adjust easily also wear easily.It reminded me of planets. It was like wearing planets on my finger.EDIT 10/27/2012:I FOUND IT! I FOUND IT! I JUST FOUND IT A FEW MINUTES AGO! I thought I had lost it in a hotel room four years ago but it must have actually fallen off when I was packing away some old baby clothes! It's a little tarnished after being in a box of stuff but it still looks great! :D"
1,"This ring is beautiful! I am very happy with it! I had no difficulty adjusting it--I just squeezed it a little bit, and it first perfectly! I wear it on my index finger. It is very comfortable."
1,I'm so pleased with this product. So lovely ring. I order yesterday received today (exact 24h later). Totally recommend it for a gift or for yourself.
1,"I just got this today in the mail and I'm already in love with it. Like another reviewer noted, it feels weird because the band is so thick, but I'm sure I'll get used to it quickly. It's beautiful - just what I wanted."
1,"I received this ring and thought ""oh my, it's big"", but I was able to adjust it to fit my middle finger with no problem. The band is thick, so I choose wear it alone and not with other rings."
0,I really loved it when i got it....but the green stone fell out after just one nite out and i can not find a stone to replace it...to bad was pretty and bold......
1,"I love this ring, I too was surprised at the thickness of the band......but it doesn't bother me. It really pretty and great quality. I can't wait to add to my amber collection with more!"
1,Words to not do it justice.I LOVE the ring. IT is very showyI wear it on my thumb -so comfortable I do not notice it is there-- except when I look at it.Takes my breath away every time...
1,Certified Genuine Multicolor Amber and Sterling Silver Adjustable Designer RingThis ring is very well made. It is absolutely stunning and very unique. I've never seen anything like it!
0,"I bought these intending to get RED 6mm earrings. What I recieved were two very light red (or what most would call PINK) earrings and, to be quite frank, they suck. While I was cleaning the new earrings in the alcohol wash, one of the CZ diamonds FELL right out of its prongs. I had to manualy put the CZ back in, and I doubt it will remain there if I were to wear them. I would highly recommend against buying this product. I am posting this on all of the colors which I was unwise enough to buy in hopes that people will avoid this product."
1,"I placed this on my wish list and my husband later gave it to me. I love this piece. It isn't expensive looking, but it doesn't look cheap either. I love the versatility"
0,"This pendant was huge! It looks great online and is pretty, but was way too big. The chain is too thin and does not work well with this pendant. Buy your own chain."
1,"When I received the product I was very pleased with it. It made a perfect birthday gift for a friend who prefers white gold/silver. Usually I like to see things in person before purchasing, but I like it on the website and took a chance. It was worth it."
1,"I love this pendant! It's a great size, works on a short or long chain (I switched it to a shorter leather cord), and it's a substantial weight, not flimsy. It reminds me of some Tiffany pendants I've seen and owned, but much more reasonably priced. I've gotten lots of compliments since receiving it as a gift (it was on my Amazon Wish List!)."
1,"The double flower pendant is very nice, and a good size pendant. I wish it came in gold, as my daughter likes silver and I bought her one, but I'd buy one too if it came in gold."
1,I bought this as a gift and my aunt loves it. She said it is beautifully made.
1,It is really nice and yes it is big. The shipping is really fast. I chose the shipping and I got it in 4 days.
1,"I bought this for a Christmas present and when I showed my husband, he knew exactly who I bought if for! That's a sign of a good gift!"
0,"Like many others, I have mixed feelings about this item. The pendant is very pretty (although a little larger than I expected), but the chain that comes with it is ridiculous! It's much too thin and looks like it can barely support the weight of the pendant. I immediately swapped it out for a thicker, longer chain and now I'm pleased with my purchase. If it weren't for the chain problem, I would give this item 4 stars instead of 3."
1,I have had nothing but compliments from this necklace! It goes well with everything that I wear! If you like silver colored jewelry it's a winner. I have had it 5 months and still hasn't tarnished.**02/08-So now I am updating the review. I have had the necklace for over 3 years and it still looks great. The compliments are still flowing and I still wear it often. I am thinking of buying a backup just in case mine ever does start looking horrible. Hasn't happend yet though.
1,"This necklace is beautiful!!! I do not think it is too large, I think it is perfect. The chain is very delicate but the pendant is well crafted. It can be casual if you wear it with casual items but also adds a simple elegance to any outfit. It is simply gorgeous and definitely a bargain for $30. It will be a piece I wear for many, many years to come. I highly recommend this piece for yourself or as a gift, seeing as I've gotten many compliments on it from friends as well!!"
0,"The pendant looks 100 times better in Amazon website, compared to the stale look in normal daylight. Supplied chain is a joke. If you paid the normal retail price for this pendant, shame on you."
1,I have received numerous compliments about my necklace. I would definitely recommend purchasing this item- great quality and price!
1,"My mother loved this flower pendant and chain. It is very light-weight, but looks pretty, and can be a great addition to your jewerly collection for the Spring/Summer. The chain it comes with is perfectly fine. If you want more sparkly, go get the sterling silver Italian diamond-cut chain, also on Amazon. It's not necessary, though. The flower pendant also can be accessorized with matching earrings, which look very nice, too."
1,I have had this necklace for a few years and its still one of my favorites!!!! It's still in perfect condition.
1,I had been searching for a nice pendant and love this one. People are also commenting on how nice it looks. I put it on one of my necklace chains though.
0,"The pendant is quite beautiful, but the chain broke within a week. Easy enough to replace, but that shouldn't happen."
1,Makes a great gift. We were pleasantly surprised at how delicate and attractive this pendant was when it arrived. The photo doesn't come close to what a lovely piece of jewelry it is.
1,"Have had this beautiful necklace for about a year and half. Everytime I have worn it I receive numerous compliments, including my mom the other day. Guess what she's getting for Christmas? lol Also the chain is nice because it is adjustable and can be worn at different lengths. Highly recommend."
1,This pendant presents a very finished look and was very much appreciated as a gift. It could cost far more than the price I paid. The person to whom I gave it wears it on a regular basis and enjoys it.
1,"I received this necklace off of my Amazon wishlist last year for Christmas, and it is one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. It's very versatile - I can dress up or down with it and wear it to work or on an evening out. The flower is very delicate and is very lightweight, the perfect size. I have had no trouble with the chain on mine - I was sent one with an extender, and I actually prefer it because I like being able to adjust it to my blouse or dress neckline."
1,This owl pin was beautiful and was just as described. Shipping was very fast. Great transaction!
1,"My girlfriend purchased this item as a birthday gift. It was a little smaller than what I was expecting, but she thought it was just fine. It came undamaged and with a free gift, which was a surprising and pleasant bonus. The item was delivered on time, actually a day or two before we thought it would arrive. The price was definitely reasonable for what was purchased. A catalog of the company's other products was also included in the package. I think if we needed a similar item to this, we would look to this retailer again."
1,"Nice piece of sterling silver jewelry. Great as a communion, graduation or even Christmas gift. Looks very nice and the 20"" chain is the perfect length. I like that it's simple but still stylish and pretty."
0,"The cross looks petite and pretty, but it is HUGE! So big it looks tacky. I sent mine back. Amazon should have given measurements of the cross!"
1,product arrived in good conditon and in good time. I have no complains and would recommend this supplier.
1,"I received this pendant quickly, and in gift appropriate packaging. I am very pleased with the necklace and with the prompt service from the seller."
0,"I got this ring hoping that it looks like the picture which was misleading. If you purchase this ring, please be aware that it is 1/10 cttw which means that the diamonds are really small. If you are a man looking to buy a ring for his significant other, I would recommend you spend it a little bit more and buy a better looking ring. I ended up returning it."
1,"I was surprised a this product, it was very pretty and I'm very happY with it."
1,I bought it at a discounted price and qas quite happy about the product. It looks great and definitely shimmers on my girl !
1,I have been looking for something like this for awhile. I really like it. It is realistic. It is not cheaply made.
1,"I ordered this ring on Monday and received it by Thursday of the same week. Ring looked better than the picture, I absolutely loved it! It has a real vintage flare to it. I was very happy with the quality of Eve's Addiction."
1,"$42.00 for an Amethyst ring? I thought for sure it would be a little on the cheap flimsy side. I'm happy to report I was 100% wrong in that assumption!This ring it gorgeous!Like another reviewer said, it probably would be a little large for someone with smaller hands. I have large hands with long fingers and it looks great (I think).I will definitely purchase more jewelry from Eve's Addiction!"
1,"What fun to wear, and the price is certainly right!However each piece is large and pointy, making it uncomfortable between the fingers. All in all, a good buy."
1,I love this pendant. It is so me and just perfect! I wear it all the time and everyone who sees it agrees that it must have been made for me! Thanks!
0,"Yes, it was alright, but I thought it could have been a little bigger. I do not know much about black onyx so maybe the price was right. I could not find a womens black onyx ring in any stores where I am from so it may my search easier. Also, my wife loves heart shaped things so it should work out. I am gving it too her for Christmas."
1,"I absolutely adore these hoops. So comfortable, quite a few compliments from my co-workers, friends and family when I wear them, especially with my hair up. One of the best purchases I've made this year with Amazon. Thank you Amazon for the quality of your products."
0,"The picture promoting this pin looks ten times better than the real thing. Really poor, cheap looking tin metal pin. It even came all scratched regardless it was shipped in a bubble envelope. Not even worth the 1.50 I payed for it much less the extra bucks for the shipping."
1,When heading to rock concerts or halloween this was a prefect decoration to my belly. Seems large and heavy but not so much dangles nicely. i would suggest purchase to those wild enough to wear it!
1,"I bought this ring for my husband and we both adore it. After awhile the black started coming off, but we like it even more without now! We love this ring and it is such a great value. I don't have to worry about his metal allergies either with this one!"
1,"I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. It is made of great quality. She loved it i deffinatly recommend as a gift if your looking for something as a gift,"
1,I purchased this ring with a gift certificate from my husband. He wasn't sure of what I wanted so he let me pick! I am truly impressed at the quality and the thorough documentation that accompanied this ring. It is the best! I have looked at a lot of jewelry but you have out done yourselves with this one.Thanks!
1,These were a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved them. It came in time and the quality was great. So much easier than going out shopping.
1,This ring is perfect coupled with a band or alone. It is bold and stunning.
1,"This necklace was a good choice, and looked even better when it arrived than on the computer. My boyfriend loves to wear it daily and shows it off every chance he gets. It is strong and will last for a long time. I would buy products from this site again."
1,This necklace is great. I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. It looks very nice and is good quality. I would definitely recommend this to anybody.
0,Ring was cute and my daughter loved it but for being silver the metal became dull rather quickly and did not clean with silver cloth like other silver rings I have. Almost like a coating that is rubbing off.
1,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous!! I love the size of the stone, the dolphin it's thinner than the one in the picture...but it's a good size and I think it looks even better like that!! and of course, it shines a whole lot =] I'm super happy with my purchase ( BUY IT)..Seller is great!! I got the ring in 4 days."
0,I order these for my mom and they cancelled the order due to not having any.
1,I bought this ring because I already owned some onyx and black jewelry that I thought would go perfect with this ring. I was right!! This ring is actually very pretty! Good buy!
1,"The ring is absolutely awesome. The color is amazing and looks just as is described online. I would recommend this seller and ring to anyone. I had the blue just like it and lost it, and I was happy that I was able to get the reddish pink one. The ring is a long-lasting sturdy ring for everyday wear. Hope this review helps someone is deciding if this is the purchase for them!"
1,I am so happy with this belly ring. It's my favorite one. I had it for a long time and when mine broke I was happy to find it on amazon. It's brand new and it's perfect.
1,"I really was impressed after getting these earrings. The stone is a beautiful shade of jade green and the surface is smooth and shiny. The hooks are quite small but stay in place. The main oval section is a little over 1/2 inch. Overall, very sophisticated and delecate looking."
1,"I purchased the Gent's Sterling Silver Slim Rectangular Malachite Ring for my son. This is a really nice ring with a beautiful green stone. The ring arrived promptly in good secure packaging and was encased in a nice silver presentation box. The condition, priceGent's Sterling Silver Slim Rectangular Malachite Ring (Available in Sizes 9 to 13) size 13 and quality of the ring is excellent and I would recommend it as a great gift."
1,My mom loved this! I live in Portugal and she lives in MN so I had to buy something that could be shipped directly to her and this was great!! The shipping was too fast!!! and the price was very reasonable! Makes a great gift!
0,"I had ordered these earrings as they are I believe on a bit of a discount now. The design is quite pretty, and the pattern is very pretty. But the silverwork was not up to my expectations. The outter ring was slightly misshapen, and there were significant flaws near were flaws on the top portion of the inner ring near where they would have been attached. I know I am being picky, but I also paid good money. I know these aren't that expensive, but excellent quality silver earrings can be had for this amount of money. Maybe my pair was just especially low quality... but I think much better can be had for the price."
1,I bought this as a gift for myself. Something feminine to make me feel girly. And I havent taken it off since. It is so dainty and shiny and pretty! I love it. This would make a perfect gift for someone special. In this case the someoen special was me. =)
1,I have bought a lot of things from Amazon and I have alway been very happy with my purchase.
1,"It is hard to find the heart shape in a sterling silver, but these earings are very cute and well set! I can wear them everyday, in to pool and everything and I have not lost a stone yet! Now that is hard to believe for the price! They look bluish in the picture but they are clear. I wish there was a smaller version of this exact earring!"
0,"These look so beautiful in the picture, but they are not that good! They don't dangle freely, so I don't like that. The back is flat, so I don't like that much either. I think the price is too high for these."
1,These earrings are beautiful! I am not sure what I will do with them yet. Keep them or give them away!
0,"As someone who has purchased thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon (everything from powertools and televisions to books and DVDs), I thought I would give their Jewelry Store a try. I have always been extremely pleased with all of my purchases, but if this is a sample of their jewelry, I'm less than pleased. Cheap packaging, and a junk chain that arrived in knots and took a half hour to untangle. This pendant looks much better on the computer than it looks when you have it in your hand. I think that jewelry is probably best purchased at a brick and mortar where you can examine it first hand."
1,Elegant amethyst earrings in Sterling Silver. Shipped FAST!! Very lovely.
1,"bought these as an option to wear in my 2nd hole and they're great. A little bigger than I was expecting, but still work fine and look great."
1,"At first I was very intimated about buying jewelry online. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this pendant (which came with a very nice chain) and the matching earrings for my girlfriend. The jewelry came in a beautiful wooden box which adds a great touch to the gift. As for the pendant it was more then I imagined. Large in size, clear & clean cut -- everything you could wish for then more. My girlfriend absolutely loved it! Fine Jewelers, INC. made it a very easy hassle-free transaction with super fast shipping!! I'll be back for sure!"
1,"received before wife's birthday but did not want to spoil box presentation by opening it beforehand. Fancy restaurant and server presented with dessert tray. Said ""look at the size of that diamond"". People stared and we had to explain it was a birthstone. Wife thinks clasp is related to Pisces somehow and it extremely happy with it. Ordered earings."
0,"This stuff looks like plexiglass. No color, dull, and very unattractive. Not even sure if it is an aquamarine stone. Don't waste your money."
0,All the advertisements of the product show a nice Aquamarine color stone. When you get the item it is nothing but a clear piece of whatever. Plus when you return the item you have to pay. Not a nice way to do business..
1,"Wow, for the price, you can't beat this locket. It is small but not too small to put the kids pictures in. Very pleased with this purchase."
0,"If this necklace had an 18"" necklace, I would have purchased it."
1,I was extremely happy with the product. The bracelet is made out of high quality swarovski crystals with a sterling silver clasp and 21st charm. It shipped quickly and was beautifully packaged in a ribboned purple box. It also contained a 21st birthday insert card with a well written sentiment. It was perfect for this special occassion. I loved it!
1,"looks pretty, but is definitely NOT for everyday use, for that price i didn't expect it to be, i bought two for my nephews (4 and 6 y/o) and they look so cute :P overall i liked them."
1,It is not often I am presently surprised. This necklace is much prettier than the photo represents.
0,I keep buying these silver chains because they brake. My next one will be a thicker one and hope it will last.
1,"I ordered the 22"", nickel free sterling chain to use with my various pendants. This chain is lovely! Very lustrous and not at all stiff. I would recomend this brand and any length to all who are looking for a chain that will have many uses."
1,"I was looking for something that wouldn't turn my neck green, and wouldn't tarnish the day I got it. I bought a 24"" and I like it so much I'll probably be getting 2 or 3 more lengths. Nice."
1,I love this chain. It surpassed my expectations. It is beautiful and sleek.
1,The silver chajn necklace is beautiful and it was delivered as scheduled. I would recommand this company.
1,"this chain is perfect! Your hair doesn't get caught in it, doesn't hurt your skin, and the silver is very nice."
1,"The 1mm Sterling Silver 24"" Italian Snake Chain Necklace is a white silver and very pretty. A good buy all around. I love it!Thanks. Mrs. L Davis"
0,"Sterling Silver Celtic Design Oval Pendant, 18""simple design, but the chain too short, still acceptable."
1,It was a gift for my girlfriend. He liked it allot and uses it almost everyday. Very good looking pendant for that price.
1,I am very pleased with this pendant; the price was reasonable; it is very pretty and I've received many compliments!
1,Got this necklace as a gift for my sister. She loves it and wears it all the time. Shipping was fast and the transaction was enjoyable over all. Thank you.
1,"Got this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it. It's a really nice piece, well constructed, and very reasonably priced."
1,"I bought this necklace for a graduation gift for a friend. She started to tear up when she opened the package. This necklace was so beautiful that I nearly kept it for myself. If you order this, there will be no buyers remorse."
1,Got this pendant with the matching earrings. Great alone or together. Little bit of sparkle adds just the right touch for casual or even dress up. Great deal.
1,I get so many compliments with this pendant- I have had it about 5 months also and its still shiny and pretty- Love the design!
0,"Nice looking but definitely not worth the price. Not even sure if its real sterling silver looks more like stainless steel. Very cheap chain and not 18"" long as stated."
1,This turned out to be the best gift my daughter received for Christmas It was boxed nicely and packaged as to not get the chain tangled. Beautiful medallion.
1,"My secretary at work really liked this St Christopher Medal necklace, which I gave her as a Christmas gift this year."
0,The first time we ordered from this company we received a gold chain instead of a silver chain. We returned it and reordered and received a chain with a broken clasp. We returned it and found a much nicer quality chain and pendant at Things Remembered.
1,"Its so beautiful, I got it for my son in dedication to my late brother who had a similar one like this. Its a little cartoony, but its a St.Christopher medal so we don't mind. Its great for the young kids!"
1,I got this for my mom for Christmas and it is absolutely gorgeous! I love the clarity and overall look. I am taking it to our priest for a blessing befor Christmas and I hope it brings my mother luck...Thank you very much!
1,This was a gift for my sister. It arrived in a timely fashion and she loves it. I was very pleased with the service. Thank you!
1,I bought this as a gift for my friend and she absolutely loved it. it is beautiful in every way. Highly recommended.
0,"this very nice bracelet has become my ""go with everything"" bracelet.it fits loosely on the wrist so it's very easy to hook and unhook without asking for help! yep, i like it. :)"
0,The clasp arrived broken. No quality control.I wish I had bought something else for my daughter on Christmas morning.I need to return it....
1,"This little bracelet was a HUGE hit this Christmas. You can see the pic, so talking about its design seems redundant. The quality of the links between the sections as well as the chain and clasp assembly seem pretty sturdy (but in no way bulky). She has worn this several times during tennis matches, and so far so good."
0,"The bracelet looks good, just like the picture. The clasp broke the first time I removed it. I didn't want to bother returning it so I just replaced the clasp with one I bought at a craft shop."
1,"I was nicely surprised to see how polished the visible side of the chain was. It looks much nicer in person than the photo, though the packaging (blue felt bag in a small white box) left a little more to be desired. My mother-in-law loved it as a gift."
0,"It's pretty enough, but much smaller then I realized. The length is actual 7 3/4"" which is fine since my wife has small wrists, but if you are expecting a full 8"" it'll be problematic. Also much narrower then I would have guessed, may be 1/4"" or so. Looks nice, a classical celtic knotwork design, and seems to be holding up okay, but not truly what was advertised. Given the fact that the size is less then stated, I'd imagine that the silver content is too. Sadly, you get what you pay for... sigh."
0,"While the cross itself looks good, the size and craftsmanship are both poor. The size given by this retailer are with the bale (this should be made clear). I probably should have queried this fact.However, the Jesus on the cross is actually starting to fall off (one arm is coming off now) and I've had this approximately one month.I would not purchase this item or recommend at all.Cheers,R"
1,These were a little spendy but are very cute for my 8 year old who is very allergic to nickel. These stainless earrings are her favorite and they don't bother her ears.Thanks Artazia!
1,"this item is wonderful..quality evident at first glance..seller a pleasure to work with..and stands behind item although there is no need to since this item is top notch! will buy from this seller again and recomend them highly for great items at affordable prices..wow!many blessings for a new year blessed by good health, loving companions and a gentle peace!"
1,"What you see is what you get. Product came in exact looking condition as picture, individually packaged, and safely sealed. Mechanical functions are in good shape. All in all I got what I paid for."
1,"This stackable ring set is so gorgeous! I was pleasantly surprised. I was getting worried while waiting for it to be delivered that I wasn't going to like it. But right when I opened the box I saw it sparkling. People might really mistaken it for the real deal...I know I would if I saw something as beautiful as this set on someone elses finger. Plus it stays put on your finger.The only thing I was initially worried about was the sizing. Usually I'm a size 7 on my right hand ring finger and 6 1/2 on my left hand ring finger. It fits my right hand which is where I initially wanted to wear it because I wear a promise ring on my left hand. But it was a little snug. So maybe it's not quite true to size, but then again, I have been gaining weight. So make sure you check the sizing charts on their websites!"
1,"This is a lovely pearl necklace. The pearls have a nice luster and the necklace lays very comfortably on my neck. it is just what I wanted, and I am very pleased with it."
0,"It is quite pretty, but the stones come out in short order with normal use. I bought this and the starter bracelet together. Once I figured out how to put it on there, which takes some figuring, it looked cute enough. Unfortunately, not as big as it looks either. I wouldn't buy it again"
0,"My 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. It is really beautiful. We were both quite disappointed, however, when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. She is a normal kid, but was not overly rough with the necklace. It is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed."
0,"We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other. This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it. Also, the locket is very, very hard to open. The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed. Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn."
1,"It is a massive chain, did not expect to be so wide. Purchased as a gift - very successful."
0,"I bought these for my mom, she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online, when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment.The entire earring is tiny, the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver, from not very far away at all, they just look like a gray blob, very hard to tell what shape. Not impressed, I suggest you look for something else.I will be returning these immediately"
0,"This pair of earring is too small for anyone but a little girl (5 to 8yr.). It's REALLY small and would look silly on an adult or even a teen. With that said, it's kinda of cute."
1,this is a beautiful ring. much shinier then the picture makes it look. the artwork is exquisite with excellent detail and the ring is very comfortable to wear as well. very well made.
0,"This product looked good, but it didn't work. When I received it, two of the six drawers would not open. I returned it for a refund."
0,"Box was nice, but small drawers fell out of casing when opened. (no kind of ""stops""). Vendor needs to list return info on amazon site, ratherthan having customer search around for email address and wait for vendors reply."
1,After much hesitation I ordered this jewelry chest. Very happy I ordered it. Fits all my jewelry and because it's clear I can see exactly what I have. Item is very sturdy and made well. Not cheap or flimsy. You won't regret buying it.
1,"Must get, total organization that looks cool!! You will know exactly what you have in each drawer..I had fun putting my makeup in each compartment..I also found a lot of makeup I diidn't remember I had.."
1,I bought this for my girlfriend for her makeup and it worked out perfectly. All of her makeup is now organized and not a mess.
1,"I am IN LOVE with this... although I did not use it as a jewerly chest, it is amazing for all my MAC make-up... it fits everything even my pro pallet that I had made. It reminds me of the one that the Kardashians had in one of their episodes. LOVE LOVE LOVE. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Ill post pics later. WOW"
1,The sterling silver band is thin and sophisticated. The peridots are genuinely beautiful and unique.
1,They seem well constructed (I've had two of them for a while now). I like the convenient way to store my glasses. The paint jobs are cool and they don't appear cheap at all.
1,"The colors are great, it can be worn at the wrist or stretched up the arm. It's a fun accessory that goes with almost anything."
1,"I was very pleased with this ring. It is my birthstone, and I absolutely love it. It is exactly how it looks, and it arrived in a cute little blue drawstring sack. I LOVE IT !!!"
1,This item was delivered within a reasonable time and I was very happy with it. It is very small but the image is beautiful. My sister in law was very happy with it.
0,I've only had this charm for a few weeks and the red seems to be coming off
1,"I was quite impressed when these arrived and wrote a review which was never posted...so I'll try again. The topaz earrings arrived almost immediately, well packaged and then additionally housed in a lovely lavender presentation box. Even more surprising than the perfectly matched gorgeous deep London blue color of the stones, was the fairly heavy weight of the silver. They will make a stunning gift."
1,"For the miniscule price, these earrings are perfect! The blue is absolutely beautiful and they really look great with your hair pulled back to allow them to shine!"
1,"These earrings are gorgeous and I bought 7 pairs for me and my female family members. I am giving them out as 'just because' gifts because the cost was excellent plus free shipping!! They come in a nice little gift box, the earrings were in separate little ziplock bags to keep them protected during shipping. Since then, I have purchased necklaces to match from this company for myself and my Mom, plus another necklace for a friend's birthday. Love this company's products!!"
1,"Bought as a gift for friends, everyone loves them, great color and looks great on."
1,"Beautiful, gold, has a rich hue. purchased as a gift for my daughter, she loved it. Highly Recomended! Quick delivery, item as described."
1,"Periodically, I browse Amazon jewelry selections, because prices can (and do) go up and down overnight sometimes. While running an Amazon jewelry search, I came across this lovely three stone ring; the price ranged (by size and gold color) from just over $90 to $300 plus. Clicking on the link regarding availability and pricing, I saw that the size 6 in yellow gold was $90 and some odd cents. To my mind? With two sons who are young men now? It was worth taking the chance to get the ring home and inspect the quality. This ring arrived today. I louped it immediately upon opening the box (it arrives in a blue velvet ring box, which is placed inside of a navy blue gift box), and I saw that the very small diamonds twinkle nicely and are not heavily included. The center stone, in particular, is very clear from the table facet. Further inspection revealed that all three stones are well cut. Please understand these are very small diamonds equalling 1/3 carat total weight. Most impressive is the solid 14K gold setting. This isn't tinfoil gold, folks. It isn't hollowed out for half or more of the shank, and therefore makes a sturdy, everyday wearable ring... albeit with seriously petite diamonds of decent sparkle and clarity. My feeling is that for the price I paid, I got a great bargain on what could become a nice promise ring for one of my sons to present to a girlfriend. Is it worth more than $300? Well, gold is at an all time high and the setting is solid, but I'd think the $200 range is more appropriate considering the diamond size, total weight and color, which is not a bright white. In the yellow gold, they look to be white. In white gold? I'd expect they'll look slightly yellow or very pale champagne. Hope that helps anyone shopping."
1,"I really like the earrings, though the other reviewer was correct--they are smaller than what the image/height stat. suggested. So I'm really pleased that there are new images up with a measurement guide to avoid future confusion. But overall, I'm pleased."
1,I am very happy with my purchase and it was delivered promptly and as promised.
1,"i absolutely love this necklace!!! i love the design and the texture of it, as well as the weight of it. its not nearly as heavy as it looks. i dont have anything bad to say about it. i would recommend it to anyone!"
1,"You will not find a better deal for the money anywhere. This ring is so beautiful. The craftsmanship is meticulous and extensive. Also, the mussel shells are pinker in person than they look online. They are deep in color in various shades of iridescent mauve."
1,"Bought this necklace, matching earrings and bracelet for my wife. She loves them. Very simple design that look very nice together or seperate with just about any outfit. Natural items like this make unique jewelry that fit just about any occasion."
1,I ordered this ring for my sister for Mother's day and I had to order one for myself! The heart shape is simple and the CZ stones have lots of sparkle. The ring is light and you don't even feel it on your finger. It is nice addition to anyone who likes sterling silver. I have ordered several rings from Amazon and I want the CZ to at least look and sparkle like the real thing. You will love this ring. Amazon has an easy return policy and makes it nice to shop knowing that. Have fun shopping........
1,"I got this ring for my birthday and I love it, I cannot imagine a woman not adoring this ring."
1,Like this ring so much that I lost it and bought a second one ....people actually think they are diamonds it doesn't gets like black or anything I have it now for 5 months and still looks new :)
1,"I received my Sterling Silver Cubic Zirconia Heart Ring,Size 6. I tried the ring on and it fits and is so brilliant in color. It was received promptly. My son, Mark, had given me a Amazon gift card and I had fun shopping via Amazon.com. It was very easy, fast, and totally enjoyed the experience."
1,"I have been searching for a sterling silver heart ring for the longest. When I seen this ring on Amazon at this price, I figured it would be worth a try. When I opened the package and finally saw the ring, I was highly impressed. As some of the other reviewers have said, the quality of it makes it look as if I spent hundreds maybe thousands on it. It is gorgeous! If you're considering and contemplating whether or not you should purchase it, I highly recommend that you go ahead and give it a try. You will love it! The shipping and delivery was very fast as well. The ring + the seller = a great experience."
1,"It was a very awesome gift, I got it for my Sister on her birthday, an she was so happy .so I think its great."
1,I wanted to replace another old ring and was afraid I wouldn't like it but I love it! I got the ring quicker than I thought.
1,Beautiful ring good quality great price. recieved compliment first day I wore it.. Nice thick band and pretty setting love it
1,It is a beautiful ring and great for the price. They shipped it right away and arrived before expected date.
1,I have worn this sterling silver cubic zirconia heart ring often and I get all kinds of compliments on it.
1,"This ring looks so pretty on my finger and I often get distracted by its sparkle when I'm out in the sun or under light. I was giggling at my mom the other day because it sparkles more than her own wedding ring. The only thing that would make this ring better is if it were white gold rather than sterling silver. But then I guess it wouldn't be $25, huh."
1,"I saw this ring on amazon and pointed it out to my husband since my birthday was coming up. It looks just as beautiful (if not more) in person as it does in the photo. Everyone commented how expensive looking and gorgeous it was. Get this ring, it definitely doesn't disappoint!"
1,The ring is wonderful! Better in person :) I recommened you to buy this ring it's worth the price and really fast shipping!
1,This ring arrived on time and is absolutely beautiful! It looks just like the picture depicts and is true to size. It is a great ring especially when you consider the price. I would definitely recommend it!
1,"I will definitely say this is one beautiful ring, and when lighting hits it.. how it shines. A well made ring considering I was surprised to see a China stamp on the band but as long as its 925 I am pleased as I love to wear silver rings. Still a very impressive appearance for being a cheaper priced ring as I find I get compliments while I wear it out."
1,"I get tons of compliments on his ring! Great quality... Especially for the price.I planned to wear this ring to a party, but I liked it so much that I wear it a lot."
1,When my boyfriend told me he was looking for a promise ring to give me I promply showed him to this ring. Now that I have it I love it. It sparkles and shines; making me very pleased he chose this ring.
1,I Bought this beautiful 925 cubic zicornia heart ring no complaints got on time even a day early it is beautiful highly recomend A+++
0,After reading the other reveiws on this item I decided to purchase this ring. It is a very nice ring but the band is very small and thin. I have had it for two weeks and so far I am happy with it.
1,I like the ring a lot. it is pretty but not garish and works well with most outfits. Well made also.
0,"I was very disappointed with this ring, it was so very small,I like larger ringsThe ad should give dimensions so a viewer can &#34;see&#34;the actual ring size."
1,"The ring is beautiful. The price was amazingly low & it looks like a very expensive ring. Packaging, shipping & delivery were excellent. I would highly recommend this product."
1,"I bought this ring with no expectations. To my delight it was better than I could have imagined, the picture doesn't do it justice. It's a sturdy, not flimsy, little ring and the heart is a great size, not to small. The cz's are better than I thought they would be and look like real diamonds. It's a great ring to add to your sterling silver collection!"
1,I ordered this ring for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and I am so excited for her to open this gift. This ring exceeded my expectations. This is the first time I have ever written a review for anything. I always read the reviews before I purchase an item and I felt I needed to tell everyone how great this ring is. It is a very nice size and the crystals almost blind you because they are so shiny. I will report back in about a month and let everyone know how well it has held up to wearing on a daily basis.
1,"I bought this ring for my mother as a gift, and wasn't expecting much for the price, but I am in awe, my mother loves it, the ring fit like a glove, and sparkles. It's just amazing. The only thing is that the box and pouch the ring comes in, looks very cheap to give someone as a gift, but then again it is cheap. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a thoughtful gift, or just a inexpensive addition to your jewelry box."
1,"For an under 20 dollar ring this thing is gorgeous. I dont know why ppl complain that it looks cheap, since it is cheap. But for a cheap ring it is really nice. I did buy another cheap ring at around the same price that had a cuter box, a cute box is not what I was aiming for when I got it. The one I got is shiny and looks incredible. If youre looking for something to show off and have someone believe you paid hundreds for it then this is not for you. It does look worth more 20 but I doubt anyone would believe you paid more than a 100 not even that. It is cute though lol have I said that enough. I have only had it for a day and I think if I can remember to stop washing it, it might last a while. It seems to be well made, all of the stones are securely in place and they are clear not milky/whitish. The heart shape was well shaped you can tell its a heart. I guess if you have skinny fingers it may look too big. Its bigger than I expected and my fingers are all swollen fat. Its cute and well worth the price."
1,"This is great piece. Wear it constantly. The Celtic spin on the yin yang design is perfect (I was looking for somthing unique as opposed to the traditional yin yang. Wanted something a little ""old world"")...And this is it. Seller got it to me in great condition and very quickly. Thumbs up on quality and service!"
0,"I liked the design on this but the necklace broke after a few weeks and the pendant itself turns a darkish color after a while, maybe it is oxidizing.. I don't know. Its just kinda cheap I guess."
0,"Put it mildly, the difference between the picture and the real thing is day and night. The actual product is tiny, dull, and cheap looking. A total waste of money. Will never buy from them again. I gave it two stars because it's shipping was fast."
1,"Based on the description and reviews from others, I bought this knowing it would be dainty, I was not disappointed. I bought this as a Christmas present as I couldn't pass up the price, so the recipient (daughter in law) has not yet seen it. Hoping she likes it as much as I do."
1,"This makes a cute gift for a ten-year-old. The pictures give a clear idea of what to expect, and the recipient loved it."
0,"Upon arrival, in huge blue box and huge blue bag, when I saw the little tiny pendant, all I could do is crack up, I know the dimension but my gosh, how tiny it is...See if my friend like this for her Christmas present.I think it will look better if it comes in a small ring box, then it won't look so tiny."
0,On line this product looked to be for an adult but when it was received was more for a child so we gave it to a grandchild rather than the adult we intended it for.
0,This thing is too mall to even be a charm on a bracelet. The item is 10x SMALLER than the picture. This item gets NO stars and I will not purchase anything from this seller again.
1,"I'm glad I read the reviews here - I wanted to buy this and the earrings for my daughter's 10th birthday later this month (it's her birthstone), and from what I'm reading it's sized just right for a child. I'll definitely get them now - thanks!"
0,This pendant is very tiny. I was very disappointed in the size. Would be good for a small child but not an adult.
0,It looked like it would be bigger and would be a pendant to fit my omega chain necklace. Not even close! Its size is maybe half the size of a woman's pinkie fingernail. Its TINY!!! Its still cute but has no weight to it and flips over it fit to snuggly (as the necklace does on my neck so I had to use a different chain).
0,I was disappointed when I received the necklace because the Amethyst Butterfly was so very small. I mean really small!!
0,"I found this pendant to be very pretty...however the size was much smaller than I expected. I should have done the metric conversion carefully and not relied on the image provided. I think this is a great piece for a little girl, but not necessarily an adult."
0,"This necklace is &#34;cute&#34;. Better for a young girl or petite woman. Very small, about the size of a pencil erasure on the end of a real pencil. Bought this for my 20 yo granddaughter because it is her birthstone. Will add a spark of dazzle, but just a spark. Shipping was fast, but I am not that impressed with the necklace."
0,I bought this gift for my mother for Christmas along with the matching earrings. I noticed at first glance that the pendant was really small.......like smaller than the matching earrings. Its not a deal breaker though. For the price its good quality though i gotta say now that ive had a chance to think about it this product is probably better for a little girl. Honestly the pendant is so small no one is going to notice what the heck it is unless your up close to it. With that said its still a cute pendant and im glad i got it for her.
0,"This was a bit smaller than I thought it would be and because the amethysts are a bit dull and not all of the same hue, it doesn't show as well as I had hoped. Because the pendant is so small, the chain should be shorter. Two and half stars is what I would actually give"
0,"Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Pendant, 18""What I received was a flower shaped cheaper necklace and it was so tangled up that I spent an hour to untangle it."
0,"I got this for my mother as a gift, and I wish I could have read these other reviews before I bought it. I have never seen such a tiny chain and pendant. For $25, it is ridiculous."
1,"this look great in person, i would recommend getting a longer and heavier chain when you get this however. the chain it comes with is a little short for most adults and is a little light, it might be easy to break. other wise my wife loved it."
1,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and I love it. It is very dainty, and I wear it all the time. It does not interfere with everyday life and it is comfortable and unobtrusive to wear. I have received several compliments on it. I think it is also suitable for young girls to wear as well."
0,"It is very tiny, but it is nice. I purchased it with my daughter in mind. It could work for kids, but it seems very delicate. There is a stamp saying ""China"" on the back of the butterfly."
0,Of the set
1,"A birthday,Wedding, or Celebrating someones life, I recommend giving this as a memory present. For kids under 14. 1/3 to 1/4 th the size of a dime. Maybe 3-4 mm. Extremely small,a miniature miniature. Think about the size of a pearl. I went to Tiffany s to compare, they wanted $165for small pendant. Their chain was cheaply made and worse then this chain. I would consider buying a thicker necklace in silver,or buy a medium width charm bracelet to hang the charm on.It is beautiful, great color and a precious thought. You may want to give after if you choose a live butterfly release. Click on pick to see,alternative ones.Native American LegandsButterflies have special meanings in numerous different cultures and religions throughout the world."
1,"We bought one of these to give our four-year-old and one to give as a birthday gift. The pendant is a great size for a little girl, but the 18"" chain is a little long."
0,It was much smaller than it looked like in the picture and the silver necklace seemed to be of poorer quality than expected.
1,This was a present for my mother who's favorite color is green. The quality was excellent and it was very elegant. The green is just lovely.
0,"I am very irritated,this is supposed to be a Christmas gift.It was to arrive by December 6th,not here yet and this is the 19th.I can find no way to talk to a human being and voice my problem.I have never had this happen when ordering from Amazon.This is very disappointing."
0,I read a review that this was small and approx the size of a dime so I thought PERFECT for a 14 year old for Christmas. WRONG! It is much smaller than a dime but it is very cute and I'm happy with it and I'm sure my 14 yr old cousin will be as well!!!
0,"Sadly I was very dissapointed when I received the necklace--It was very, very tiny and not what I had hoped for."
0,"I should have read the reviews, it is pretty but this will be given to my granddaughter now instead of my daughter"
1,"The Ring is beautiful - this includes the stone - I have real flawless diamonds, which i never wear, for fear of losing a stone. This fake stone has fewer facets than my real ones but, it is still a very nice looking stone.I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,"Great ring for the money looks real! Awesome cut, fit, finish. Very good CZ. Nice mounting. Highly recommend it."
1,"The ring is beautiful. It demonstrates that sterling silver WITHOUT platinum,rhodium, nickel plating is by far the best choice. The silver shines with a beautiful soft white shine. The stone is a little less brilliant than the very best CZ, maybe because of the cut, and it has less fire (you see more blue than anything else), but it is still very good, and in bright daylight it dazzles. I am very happy with the ring and would recommend Sabrina sterling to everyone."
1,I wear my pair all the time. The stones were beautiful and a great big size. They stand out and look great with whatever I wear.
1,"They arrived this afternoon and I couldn't be happier. Well made and very beautiful, nice colour. Garnets are said to be symbols of positive or good luck. I'll be happy to wear these!"
1,"I really love these garnet earrings. The color is lovely. Very deep brilliant cranberry red. They look far more expensive than they are, and the size is perfect. The settings are sturdy and the posts are a comfortable length. I'd recommend these for sure."
1,"Just received the 6mm round garnet earrings and I am very very pleased with the color and sparkle of the garnets. The sterling silver earrings are also a very nice weight, and the back is substantial so the earrings don't feel like they will fall off -- all in all, a very good bargain for the price!! One word of caution"
1,"I bought these for myself and they are beautiful. I will be wearing them long past the holidays. They are just the right size, a beautiful deep red, and very sparkly. The silver is shiny but I like it. The earrings are well made and sturdy, the backs stay on, and they work well for being on the phone a lot at work. Comfortable and easy to wear, and the color goes with a lot of my wardrobe. I thought they were worth the price."
0,"Detail in knot is very less than clear. Pendant is good weight and a good value at the price. Did not care for the necklace, a double slip knot, which kinda looked cheap and took away from the pendant."
1,"I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON ""PINK"" RINGS-AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET ONE THAT DOES'T HAVE A NASTY YELLOW GLOW-UNLESS YOU GO TO A PINK DIAMOND(AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT)-WELL I HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL ESTATE PINK BAND WITH A SOFT PINK COLOR(NO YELLOW) AND I SAW THIS-GOT IT-NOW HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WEDDING SET THAT LOOKS LIKE PINK DIAMONDS.I LOVE THIS RING.IF YOU REALLY KNOW PINK RINGS AND WANT A REAL PINK WITHOUT THE YELLOW GLARE=THIS IS IT.JUST GORGEOUS.THANKS FOR SUCH A NICE RING THAT I COULD AFFORD."
0,Fun idea for a belly ring. Wasn't as impressed when I received it. Still a cute idea but just wasn't for me.
1,"I have bought four things from the Silver Insanity line, have been very pleased with them all. They really give you quality merchandise as half the price you would expect pay. This is a great chain. Every delicate, yet strong. It has a ""flat"" side so the light reflects of the chain well. I have paid two and three times for silver chains this length.Silver Insanity is just a super line."
0,"I received this ankle bracelet in a timely fashion from Sabrina Silver. It is a beautiful piece, unfortunately, it turned my ankle black. In addition, the constant ""jingling"" with every step drove me and my co-workers crazy. I have promised to give it to my niece whose nerves and friends are less sensitive."
1,"Good size about a half dollar piece, nice weight to the metal, not chinsy. The cord is nice that its adjustable so it can be choker sytle or worn long, or you can cut it and put it on a chain instead, the material is like a hard leather. I really enjoy this necklace, the wolf is my celtic animal sign and its a great conversation topic, I just got it and its been noticed quite a bit, and the price cant be beat, would highly recommend!!!"
1,This is a great piece for me. Very similar to the family coat of arms from days of yore. Only problem for me is the size of the leather pendant. Can't get it over my noggin.
1,"The pendant is very well crafted and I'm not at all afraid that I will break it. The pendant also has some weight so I know it's there. I couldn't have asked for more, especially at such a great price."
1,Delivered on time via amazon. This was part of a Halloween costume and it was perfect! Beautiful craftsmanship. It was a bonus that the necklace was adjustable so it sits right where you want it to. Great deal for a beautiful piece.
1,"Good finish, good quality- particularly for the price. The animals portrayed could pass for a variety of animals which isn't what I was after but still is a nice piece."
1,"I bought one for myself, my husband, and my son. We love them :) Pewter is harder than Silver, so we haven't had the issue of denting and scratching that I have with another silver pendant I own.There is a clear coat of some sort that appears to be coming off of my husband's pendant, but he wore it pretty much constantly for months, even in the shower. My son and I have not had any problems with ours.Both my boys have rather large heads, lol, and the adjustable cord is perfectly long enough for them, but also works for me to tighten so the pendant is visible above the neck of my shirts.Overally very cool, original pendant. If you like the design you should not be dissappointed! :)"
0,"This looks much prettier in the picture. I had initially bought it for a friend for Christmas, but ended up giving it as a gift to my eight year old daughter. It almost looks like something you would find in the toy department. I have ordered other jewelry from Amazon and loved it, so one dud is not bad."
1,"The picture does not do this charming anklet justice. The silver is polished, the charms adorable, and the length perfect."
1,"Love this bracelet. I like things you don't find everywhere else and this is one of them. Looks much better in person, I was pleasantly surprised. I bought it as a birthday present for my little girl and now I want one. :)"
0,"Although this ring is very pretty on screen ~ Buyer Beware ! In person it is cheap looking and a couple of the stones are crooked, I have not bothered to send it back ~ not worth the aggravation ~ my 9 yr old uses it to play dress-up (she has better looking dress-up rings in her collection - need I say more !)"
1,this is my favorite labradorite necklace! the shades vary beautifully and i always get compliments when i wear it. thank you neeru and novica.
0,very disappointed with this brqcelet the 16 charm was not on straight. as i tried to straighten the charm it broke off of the bracelet. i took it to my jeweler and he stated it wasn't even sterling silver. what a rip-off. he said the whole bracelet wasn't worth more than $5.00 . it cost me additional $10.00 to repair a new bracelet. i had no choice as it was a gift for my niece and godchild. i wanted it to be special. i don't know how you get away with selling such inferior products!
1,I ordered this item for my son who just turned 1 for a first piece of jewelry/keepsake for when he gets old enough to wear it and I won't have to worry to much. The metal is duller than what it appears in the photo and it's not the same all the way around but it's sturdy and very appealing. The design is balance and not to heavy. My Great Grandmother and Great Grandfather were both full blooded Blackfoot Native Americans so this necklace allows me and my Children(currently pregnant with #2)to keep in touch with our culture and allow us to hand it down to future generations without having to keep it put up all the time and gingerly handle it. Great necklace and highly recommended.
1,"I liked the way this looked online and after receiving it as a gift and actually wearing it, I love it. The hanging feather detail balances the design perfectly and the pendant is a great size - eye catching but not unwieldy or tacky. It's on an adjustable length cord which I appreciate for when it interferes or gets lost with a neckline, though I personally keep it snugged all the way up to choker length. The only negative is that it's cast front side only, so if it flips over it's very definitely the back of the piece, not identical to the front. In person, more of a pewter color, not super silver like the photo."
1,I like pretty simple jewelry and i bought this on a whim. it is so delicate and beautiful in real life. I love it!
1,"This ring is the greatest ring I've seen in the entire world! The more I look at it the more I like it. Even though at first I thought it was smaller than I've expected, it simplily looks elegant. I love the fact that it's my birthstone. I totally recommand this."
1,This is a small ring and I really like it. I can wearing it on my pinky finger and have a larger ring on my ring finger without the two of them clanging against one another.I wear this ring often and notice no obvious dings or places of wear.
0,my mum liked it as it was a christmas present for her . But it was very bendy and looks out of shape. the bracelet looked shiny in the picture and wasnt shiny when i got it .
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife, and she loves it. She's worn it now for at least 4 months, and it still looks great on her, and is her favorite bracelet. So far, it has taken every day wear with ease. No damages, scratches or anything. IF something ever happened to it, I would buy another in a minute! If you like this bracelet, you should strongly consider buying it!"
0,I purchased this as a gift for my Grandmother for Christmas and she loved it. But within a month she told me that one of the links broke.This is a nice item to have strickly for decoration/display purposes only. The links are not very durable and regularly handling it will inevitably lead to it breaking.Your decision to purchase it should be based on its intended use. Hope this helps.
1,"I bought this for my son's First Communion and we were pleased with it. It is good quality, attractive, and unique."
1,I purchsed this product for a school project. I needed something that look like it might have come through Ellis Island. The rosary was actually quite beautiful. We will be using it far beyond the project. The rosary arrived as promised through Amazon Prime. I would buy from theis company again.
0,"These rosary beads are nice but one of the links needs repair. It needs tightening. Otherwise, no complaints about this product."
1,The rosary was very beautiful. Made a great gift to a friend. Shipping time was excellant.
1,"After getting engaged, I had to start the task of finding a wedding ring that had some style, imagination, masculine, and was comfortable. I did my homework and searched all of the recommended specialty jewelry shops and just couldn't come up with anything different that had any slight amount of imagination. They all carried the standard same old designs with slight differences from each other but nothing inspirational so it was extremely disapointing. I was very discouraged and about ready to give in and buy a standard common and expensive wedding band until finding this ring on Amazon as a last effort.Since purchasing this ring, I have found the exact same ring selling at other jewelry stores for over $500 (on sale). The selection at Amazon was absolutely amazing, bordering overwhelming, but it did end a lot of searching. Although I hate wearing jewelry, I found this ring to be very comfortable to wear and durable so it can take typical everyday abuse.No need to drive from store to store only to spend hundreds more for less selection. For the same price as the closest mall was charging, I was able to get three, since I have a habit of losing them, and still have enough left over to have one engraved. The only difference is it appears gold colored on the web page but is actually more of a brushed nickel color when they arrived."
1,"I am very happy that I picked that particular ring, my grandson was estatic with it,and all of his friends are green with envy!!sincerely,Sandra Alfrey"
1,"My sister picked this out for me to order. It looks so much better in person! If you love hammered style pieces, you will love this one!!"
1,I bought this bracelet for a present for one of my daughters for Christmas. She is 17 and loves elephants. It was very beautiful and a great price.
0,"This is a nice bracelet, for someone who can wear it. Fortunately, Sabrina is easy to work with and returning the bracelet was easy. The real size on this bracelet is 7.25 inches.If merchants read these reviews, then please read this..PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE provide ACCURATE sizing for your bracelets. Yeah, I know I can e-mail you and find out, maybe, but YOU need to remember that 99% of ALL purchases are impulse buys. They don't wait to send an email and hope they get the answer they want, if at all. Let me help you if you don't already know how to measure the bracelet size.* Cuffs and bangles"
1,"If you're worried about quality from Amazon as your online jeweler, don't. Beautiful products top of the line quality!"
0,Total ripoff. Cost me additional 70 USD to get the size right. This was no coincidence and almost spoiled the special day for us. Stay away from this...
0,"while very sharp looking, the clasp is VERY difficult and fiddly. within days the cable had come undone. contacted retailer who offered to repair it but did not offer to cover shipping. when i mentioned i lived abroad, heard no more...."
0,"The bracelet is made of nice materials and is well made. It's a little stiff due to the surgical steel middle band, but otherwise great.Notice that the metal bars on the three stands slide - so if you get them caught on something or move them they will slide up and down the bracelet which causes some shaving of the rubber strands."
0,"The silver steel and black rubber look good together and match well with any outift. But, the clasp is a little hard to undo and lock on."
0,This bracelet did not fit well at all... it didn't help that the bracelet was warped. The clasp was very difficult to use as well. I have purchased other items from Sabrina before and have been very happy but this one is going back.
1,"At first, I thought this bracelet doesn't fit in my big wrist but I was wrong. Great catch in a worth price. It took 3 days (Standard Shipping) and I have the item. Simple, Durable and stylish bracelet. Thank you and I loved it."
1,I bought this product as a present. The person loves it and it's great for casual occasions or for going out.
0,"The shiping was great it didn't take long, but the rings quality left much to be desired. the hinges are weak both the first one on the right side and the last one broke... you could see that there wasn't much material holding it together in the first place... but the rest of the hinges held."
1,I bought this for my teenaged brother. He has been wearing it for about a year and loves it! It has held up well :)
1,Good quality. Good Price. Good deal.I've had it for about a month now and it is still in good order.The clasp on the back still works just as well as when it was brand new.
0,"This necklace is very pretty. The only problem with this necklace is the spring ring clasp. The necklace clasp turns and catches the underside of my hair. Ouch! I had to cut the hair from the chain. Until I take it to change the clasp, it will be pony tail only necklace."
0,"Supposed to be sterling.. It's not, sterling doesn't turn black like this thing does.. Wish I would've stuck with the Peter Stone silver I usually get."
0,Last year I bought myself a more expensive version of this ring. My 13 year old niece loves my ring. Every time I am around her she wants to try mine on. I wanted something similar for her that it would hurt if she damaged or lost it and I discovered this ring. She loves this ring. Wears it all the time. I believe you get what you pay for and this version will do just fine for her until she's older and knows how to take care of a more expensive ring.
0,"I was excited when I got this becasue it was exactly what I wanted big and sparkling. It is also very strong and durable. I was really disappointed at how fast the shine went away, I wasn't expecting real gold and gem quality but I had hoped that for the money it would have lasted longer than a couple days. I wore it to work for two days and by the end of the second day it was dull had lost its luster nad one of the side diamopnds had fallen out. I am a receptionist so it isn't like I get dirt and grime on my hands and do anything that would ruin it quickly. I even tried cleaning it with a jewelry shining cloth and it just didn't shine it up. Overall it is ok but for near $30 for a fake ring I expected more."
1,"The ring is very pretty when you receive it. It comes in a cute little box with a bow on it. The ring is of a great quality and looks nice on your finger. The price for such an item is great when you are looking for beautiful ,quality jewelry at lower prices. The delivery time was excellent as well. I recommend wholeheartedly ordering from this place for just about all your jewelry needs!"
0,I have no idea why I bought this ring but it really isn't good at all. After about a month the band tarnished and I basically didn't wear it anymore. I used jewelry cleaner and it made the stones shine but the band became worse. I believe it ended up in the garbage. It would be cute for a kid but then again I see the stone fell out for that poor kid. I on the other hand am 22.
1,I lost my favorite silver hoop earrings and came to Amazon to try and replace them. I saw these - which are larger than the ones I had. But I ordered them and not only did they arrive only 3 days later but were absolutely beautiful! I have worn them daily ever since!
1,"Just received this ring in the mail. I love, love, LOVE IT!!!! CZ stone not too big and therefore makes it look realistic! So happy with my purchase!"
1,"Completamente satisfecha con el produco y el precio, todo llego de manera corecta y el envio fue super rapido.Definitivamnete volveria a comprar estas bolsitas."
0,What you expect for a few dollars. Material isn't fancy. Biggest complaint is the false advertisement; its actally 4.5 inch by 3.5 inch. I would of ordered a differnt set if I knew about this.
1,Nice silk pouches. They are plastic lined with an inner zipper and an outer snap. All good quality. I use these to store pendulums and stones.
1,"It was worth the wait. When I received this package I could not believe how beautiful the wedding band was. It was much better than many of the other bands I've been shopping for in my area. I would recommend purchasing wedding bands from Amazon.Not only that, paying was easy and I give an A++ for shipping. Very fast!"
1,"lovely item. but i followed the other customer reviews and ordered a half size up because they said it was sized smaller... well, it was too big.so i ended up sending it back to get my normal size.the quality looks wonderful."
0,The ring looks good and is definitely worth the money. The ring is not that comfortable but you get used to it. It is slightly thinner than 6mm but hardly noticeable. It looks great though! You wont find anything better for the price. A good buy.
0,"I ordered several rings from this seller, but this is my least favorite. The enamel lines are not perfect with the cz lines, if that makes sense. I see runover. Pretty ring though because of the color."
0,I liked the product and would buy from the seller again. It arrived quickly!
0,"Not as sturdy as I thought. Picture looks good on web but in reality, rather flimsy."
1,I bought them for my daughters birthday. She hasn't gotten them yet but I think they are very nice looking and I know that she'll love them.
1,-Came faster than i thought.- fabulous quality- nice size- great details-decent priceoct 29 07 was the first time i wore it (day after i got it) and i was complemented on it many times.
1,This was recieved fairly quickly.The silver is genuine and is stamped on the back as such.It is very light and extremely shiny. :)I wear it every day.Love the Celtic Cross.
1,"Item was just as described, even nicer. It was a gift and came packaged ready to present. Would definetly buy fro them again."
1,This is a really nice Celtic cross in a larger size. Well worth it.
0,"This is a serviceable little pin. I bought it for my legion hat, to put with an assortment of other small pins and am pretty unimpressed. It will do; I certainly don't want to buy another, but . . . it is very blurry and the backing isn't great."
0,This item looks very nice in the box but it is really lite and has a few rough edges on it
0,"I honestly expected something a little bigger. The flower does look pretty but it is hard to see since it not big, Also, the thickess of the ring is not exactly what I expected"
1,"I bought this for my brother-in-law, a hardcore Harley fan. It is cool, since it's a bike chain, and it has an upscale look. The titanium has a nice lustre and is lightweight. I am not worried about resizing the bracelet for him, as he is incredibly handy and will do it himself. Nice bracelet!"
1,This was actually bigger than i expected. I get so many compliments on this ring. It is a dainty ring but stands out. I am so pleased and wear it every day. The tiny chips of diamonds compliment the center stone.You do not have to have it under lights for it to sparkle. One of the best purchases i have made.
1,"I purchased this ring when I lost my wedding band. Sure it doesn't look like a wedding band, but for the price, I had a ring to wear again. The profile is not shown in Amazon's pics. The setting around the central diamond is an open scroll type design -- like an antique ring. The black diamond does not pit or scuff like black onyx. It is a simple but effective cut. The accessory diamonds do sparkle and in the 4-5 months I've worn this ring, I've not lost any of the little diamond chips. They appear to be fixed well on the band. I bought it at the Friday sale for about $100. I'd buy it again in a flash for the $129 it's listed at today."
1,My girl friend loved it and it was exactly the right size. Thank you Amazon.
1,"Beautiful style of ring. The white diamonds are very sparkly, they are also very small. Still very glowing. Not very substantial. Good for daily use. The black diamond has good size. Would recommend."
1,"I was given this ring on V'day from my Boyfriend as an engagement ring, I couldn't have asked for anything better it's beautiful I love it. The ring shines and sparkles even in dim light. It's bigger then it looks in the pictures and the open scroll inlay is stunning and it has this amazing antique look to it. I constantly get complements on it. It's the perfect ring engagement ring for some one who wants something different and stunning."
1,"I love pretty earrings. Le't face it. I love pretty things. I had looked at these earrings and passed them up for something ""danglier,"" but these stayed in the back of my mind. So one day, I saw them on my Wish List, revisited them and bought. I thought of them as a casual purchase which I would wear occasionally. I surprised myself. I wear them quite frequently as they have turned out to be Beauty in a Small Package. They are great for casual days when I do not have to have something that matches just so so but want something flashy! They are nice and small (not too small to show up at all.)and I do not have to worry about dangles if I am cleaning or something. The Opals are of a very nice quality and are quite brilliant making Real beauty in a small package. I hate to keep harping on the fact that they are small, they are not really small. I am just used to wearing one and a half to two and a half inch dangles so for goodness sake take that into consideration when buying. They are probably what most people consider to be ""just the right"" size. One of the things I like the best about them is how easily they go on. I find myself wearing them quite often and consider them to be one of my best investments. If you decide to get them, I hope you like them as much as I do."
1,"These opal huggies are gorgeous--much prettier than in the picture. The picture doesn't show the sparkle and glow of these earrings. What a bargain, and everyone comments on them when I wear them. I am most pleased!!"
1,I bought these earrings as a birthday gift for my Mom and she loved them! She likes hinged hoops and I was looking for something a little different for her. These hoops are small but really stand out! The opals have tons of fire and the sparkle of the diamond cutting enhances their beauty. The glowing reviews here helped me decide to purchase these earrings and I couldn't have been happier when I received them. The photograph doesn't do them justice. They are gorgeous!
1,Very nice earrings. Love the comfort of leverbacks and the less worry of them falling out. Simple yet classy. All around wear! Love it!
1,They're very very pretty and shiny. Great size to wear all day long. Loved them. Lost them already. Getting another pair!
1,I think these are just adorable. Very cute to just slip on and go. I used mine a few months back as a nursing reminder bracelet with my newborn. Worked great!
1,The earrings are of wonderful quality strong dense silver with a beautiful pendant tear drop. I simply adore them they are really worth every penny.
0,"I wore this part of my pregnancy, and people always said something about it because they could see it through my shirt, and the pink balls fade in the sunlight. Plus if something snags it, shirts, basically anything it hurts so incredibly bad that I cried one time. I do not recoment this I would say don't go with the plastic, or don't wear one at all. I wore my regular metal one."
0,I bought this after I got pregnant thinking my belly would grow making my belly rings too small. Not the case. I never had to take out my original belly ring. The pregnant belly ring is completely unneccessary.
1,For the price this is a bargain. You can't go wrong with this item it is one size fit all and it is cute.
1,"The product came in a timely fashion, and was greatly appreciated by the recipient.It is a fine, delicate piece of jewelry."
0,"I bought these earings for a sister in law for Christmas, and it being only a week away from Christmas, I won't be able to return these on time to get the right pair on time! Very incovienent. I bought these butterfly pair of earings and one butterfly is a dark purple as the other one is a baby purple. Major difference. I will be returing this item."
1,"Exactly as described and a great value. Beautiful!Would also make a great gift, altho I got these for me!"
1,These earrings are beautiful and wee woth the price. I may get a pair in another coloras a gift for my friend.
0,"Other poor reviews seem to mention the color as problem, but I felt the earrings were very true to the color and appearance in the images. My daughter loved them, unfortunately the post separated from the butterfly on the first wearing on one of the earrings and the other earring post also began to bend from the other earring. Maybe I just got a bad set."
0,The Earrings you sent me are real light in color not the pretty dark color you show in the picture. They look almost light pink. I will keep them they are also pretty but not what I expected.
1,It was a homecoming gift to my beloved wife. She is crazy about butterflies. She loved it so much. She also loved the fact that it is not so big and was the perfect size. Although I didn't find the gift card I requested with it.
0,"The pendant and earrings are pretty but very small, and I think they are overpriced for what you get. I could have gotten the same at Claire's for about half the price."
1,"Purchased these for my wife, for Christmas. They are indeed lighter in color than the picture, a very faint purple. They are also fairly small. But they are beautiful, quality pieces of jewelry."
0,Once I put it on. (Which I even clean my earrings b4 I wear them.) my ears started to itch And bother me I had to take them off quick. I'm allergic to fake earring and these gave me a full allegic reaction
1,"My husband give it to me as a present, they are lovely :), not to big, not to small, just perfect for my ears."
1,got these to match the neckless I got her a while ago and they match like the set they are.
0,Too small. The pictures were deceiving. Must have used a Magnifying glass.Other than the small size they were very nice.
0,"Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly EarringsGreat product, a bit over priced for the over all quality. Product was a birthday present for my wife, she was pleased."
0,The earrings are cute but I see a young girl wearing them more so than me.
1,Absolutely love this ring. The color combination is to die for and every time I wear it I am showered with compliments on it. One of my favorite pieces of jewelry.
1,I'm not into jewelry and don't know much about it. I bought it as a gift for my Grammy and she seems to love it. Nice and lovely pendant I think.
1,"I am a amber collector and was impressed with the look of this faux amber. When I want to go casual, this bracelet is definately a great buy!"
1,"This is a beautiful little necklace. I got it for my best friend who not only loves the colour purple, but she loves frogs as well!It was delivered quickly and is exactly as described."
0,"can't review, as never recieved the pendant, as it was out of stock once I had bought it, although it didn't say so initially."
1,This quality necklace chain was well worth the price and the service was excellent!!!!
1,"These earrings are lightweight, long and sexy. I have long blonde hair and I love having earrings that don't get lost in my hair. When I wear these, they still show even when I wear my hair down. In fact they compliment my hair and just look sexy."
1,Thank you very much for the charm - my sister is delighted with it!
0,"I am disappointed with these earings. They looked more solid on the photo, but they are flimsy. Also the amethyst stones look very pale and also not like the photo. They look much cheaper than they were (in cost), so that is the main reason for my disappointment.I bought them as a gift for my daughter and thought I would be pleased to give them, but I am not!"
1,"I just received these earrings, amazingly quickly from Amazon (thank you!) and I really love them. They are tinier than I expected, but they still look beautiful as I prefer small earrings. The sapphires are deep blue, almost black, but they shine in the light, due to their beautiful facets. The diamond in the middle is tiny but it lightens the flower. I'll try to buy the other same earrings with ruby, and emerald."
1,"Was very pleased with the appearance of the earrings. Workmanship is very well done, and the service was exceptionaly fast. I liked the fact that they required a signature for delivery."
0,In the picture these look like emeralds. In person the stones were lighter green and looked like peridots.I returned these earrings. They would be pretty if they came as pictured.
1,"I Didn't Purchased the necklace when I Purchased the earrings. When I gave my wife the earrings she said ""I love them, and the rubies match so well, Does it come with matching necklace?"" I just Purchased the matching necklace today. Good value for the money!"
0,"Nice little earrings, but much more delicate than they look. Be very careful about removing and putting them in your lobes. Both lever-backs of mine are shaky after only two wears and I've had to have them strengthened at a jewellers."
0,"I got this from amazon and returned them, the emerald color was a very soft shade of green, more like jade not emerald green. I bought this and the matching pendant, the pendant on the other hand was beautiful, the emeralds are very rich and dark and looks much more expensive. If it hadn't been for the color of the stones, I would hace kept the earrings. (Just in case, I just ordered this earring again, hopefully I will get ones that match the pendant)"
0,"Aside for the fact that these earrings were TINY, the quality of the emeralds was appaling. The 4 C!S of gemology are cut, clarity, concentration and carat. The emeralds were a weak solid gray, in fact they looked like poor quality jade. Shame on the manufacturer, and shame on Amazon for missrepresenting these earrings."

1,My nieces just got a new puppy and I couldn't resist getting them this cute charm for their charm collections as a reminder of the year of the puppy. They loved it.
1,"Although the product arrived one day late from the day expected, I truly love the uniquenessof this lovely Star of David. I choose it since it incorporates three of my favorite icons. I alwaysreceive positive compliments whenever I wear it."
0,I got the item which is different from what I expected. it was black color in stead of blue. So I have returned and refunded it.
1,"If your wife/girlfriend/significant other ever says ""I'd like some Sapphire studs"", buy these. The price is great, the size is great, the metal is great (won't turn her earlobes green) and they come in a presentation that's pretty much flawless. They're a beautiful deep blue with a nice cut that's nicely reflective without having a ""glitzy"" look - she can wear these to work every day if she wants. Also, the presentation is perfect - they come in a small blue velvet box with a metal clasp that's inside another blue velvet box with a white ribbon that's velcrowed together so no ribbon breaking needed, and that in turn is in a blue velvet bag with draw strings. There's absolutely no need to add anything to it - take it out of the cardboard box it ships from Amazon in and you're ready to hand it to her.The best part of the whole thing is that other women will want them when they see her wearing them - my boss is a woman and when she saw them on my wife, her comment was instantly ""if you don't want them, I'll take them!"". This got quite the smile out of my wife, which, after all, is the main objective of the whole thing - make her happy."
0,The necklace was just what I wanted. The only concern I have with it is that the wrapping has come a little undone and I might have to eventually fix it but other than that it is a great multi-purpose necklace.
1,"it was really difficult finding a solid black colored barbell that was either bioplast or UV. this one was exactly was i was looking for and shipped faster than i imagined it would. its flexible like it says, but too much bending will definitely snap it, so just be aware of its limitations."
1,"I have been looking for a nice ring to wear on my right hand and I found this one after many tries. This ring is beautiful and it looks like each little diamond has been secured in place so hopefully the diamonds will not fall out- as with previous rings- Sparkly and looks good on petite fingers.Update--- diamonds fall out and gold turns off color-- Oh well- you get what you pay for,,,,,"
0,"The ring was a little bigger in heigth than I thought it was going to be. It would look better if the you have longer fingers. The spinners works very well, spins freely without effort."
1,"This ring looks like an expensive ring and the spinner feature is good for someone who is fidgety. It is really great quality and the price is amazing. It is shinier than in the picture, it looks very nice. The only problem is that the edges are angular and this can be a problem if you wear your ring constantly. For example, it is uncomfortable to wash your face with this ring on. My husband forgets his ring when he takes it off, so this ring was not ideal for him to keep taking off and forgetting when he was showering. If you do not have that problem then this is a great ring to consider."
1,"It came in a silver box and was shipped sooner than I expected. It has excellent craftsman work, great for any occasion and the price is the best part, it's very very affordable and I am not just saying that."
0,"Obviously you shouldn't expect a whole lot for under $10, but if it's going to be junk, why even sell it? You have to force the ring to spin and the edges seem kind of rough so the cut into your fingers. Lesson learned, if the price seems to good to be true, it usually is."
1,"This is a very beautiful ring! It is just how it looks in the picture. It is hard to find nice, true to form wolf jewelry. This is one of those rare, well designed wolf items! It is a bit fragile because it is 925, but you can bend it back easily."
1,"I bought this pendant as a gift, worried that it might not be as high quality as I wanted for the price. However, the composition was exactly what I wanted, so I ordered it, knowing I could always return it. My fears were put to rest when it arrived for the detailing was just as clear in person as in the photograph provided, if not better. The craftsmanship is beautiful, much better than I expected for the price I paid. This is an excellent piece of sterling silver jewelry. Do note that this is for the charm only, no chain included, but that's to be expected for the price involved."
0,"This is a really cute belly ring in person, but the only problem is it is a bit top heavy and it's a bit hard to screw the ball on since it's not hinged and the chain gets in the way as well."
0,"When this ring arrived, I was impressed with it's size, considering that I paid just under $60.00. There was a great deal of gold, and the semi-precious gem stones were of good size. It might have been a pretty cocktail ring. Unfortunately, the picture and the ring were not the same. The picture has stones that look light and well-coordinated. I had no idea what kind of stone my ""blue topaz"" was because it was a dark, teal green in color. I couldn't tell the difference between the amethyst and the garnet, which were practically identical. Overall, the colors and arrangement of the colors, made the ring look depressing and cheap. Even the gem stone baquettes above the stones gave it a look of poor design, something not evident in the picture. I'll have to send this back -shame on the designer."
1,This is a very modern looking and very lightweight Titanium bracelet. The Decor on it only adds to its overall sleekness. It looks fairly easy to adjust with removal of links if needed.
1,"I had had a similar ring that was a cherished gift from a friend and it was lost during a hospital stay. I had looked everywhere for a ring to replace it and was unable to find one. So I was thrilled to find this ring on Amazon.Com. The size was perfect and the ring is slender enough to be comfortable on my finger, yet the word stands out very clearly. I've seen some rings with Jesus' name on that are so thin that the name was just about unreadable. It also doesn't seem to tarnish the way my other ring did. I've seldom had to polish it. I'm very pleased with this ring and am going to order one for a friend's birthday as soon as I find out her ring size. She has mentioned how much she likes my ring. This ring is very nice and the price is reasonable."
1,"Pendant Loving Family Sterling / B000PAOHBII received this from my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I'd been looking at it online forever and when he asked if I'd like anything this year, I couldn't resist. I'm always concerned about ordering jewelry ""unseen"" online, but this pendant was worth every penny.The silver is bright and shiny and completely without any blemish or scratch. The necklace chain is of high quality, with a good strong clasp. The necklace chain is small enough that you can remove it from the pendant, if you decide to switch out the existing chain with another (although since the necklace is of such high quality, you won't need to switch out the chain unless you just want a different length).The picture here is a little hard to judge for depth, but another reviewer noted that the pendant is ""flat"", so I knew what to expect. In person the ""body"" of the couple is a thin, flat sheet of silver, and the ""arms"" are raised and form a delicate heart shape that stands out from the pendant. The ""heads"" are rounded and perfectly conceal the rounded loop on the back through which the chain passes.This pendant is absolutely stunning, and I'm certain that we will be ""upgrading"" to one of the other family pendants, should a little bundle of joy decide to come along in a few years.~ Ana Mardoll"
1,"I bought this necklace for my mum as a Christmas present, and I'm happy to say that she loved it! It is high quality, very shiny and simply beautiful, definitely worth the money.The box that came with it was not the one pictured here, which didn't bother me, but it might some people. It came in a hot pink box that said ""A Loving Family"" on the top of it."
1,"I bought one for a friend of mine and trust me when I say I want one for me, love it... Made well and I hope my friend likes it as much as I did.."
1,Bought this as a gift for my wife on Mothers Day. It was a huge hit. It seems to capture her love and devotion to our child in a cute design that she immediately connected with.
1,"Great item! Brought my girlfriend to tears, since her husband isn't in to this stuff. Great for first child!"
1,"I bought this for my daughter, who, after great difficulty conceiving a child, through the miracles of modern reproductive science was finally able to give birth to her own beautiful daughter. This pendant is a beautiful symbol of the wonder that is my granddaughter."
1,"This is a beautiful gift for moms, the material and the finish of the pendant are really nice, totally recommended!"
1,I will soon be a single mom to an infant child. I purchased this for myself as an early mother's day gift. It's perfect!
1,"purchased this for my 2 year old son to hand his mom on christmas morning. It is beautiful and one of her favorite pieces of jewelry. It didnt hurt when that sweet youngun said "" I bought dis fo you mommy"""
1,The product arrived ontime and was beautiful. Good quality for a good price and good service.
1,"My wife loves this piece, and the kids were excited to give it to her. A simple yet elegant gift."
1,"I had one of these, but lost it. I believe the chain was too lightweight for the weight of the pendant. One of the loops probably spread out enough to come loose. I loved my necklace! It is beautiful and has a great message, but it is ""heavy"" as pendants go. 2 parents and 3 kids! So get a good strong chain, and check it periodically to make sure all LOOPS are still closed."
1,I received this necklace for Mother's day and I love it. I wear it everyday and have gotten many compliments on it.
1,I sent the 'Loving Family' sterling silver necklace to a niece after telling her how much my daughter-in-law loved hers. She was delighted to receive hers too. She put it on right away and called me to thank me. I guess I made her day.Loving Family(R) Small Sterling Loving Mother and 2 Children Pendant
1,"very simple, it doesnt screem look at me! which makes it that much better for everyday where, but still looks great when going out too."
1,"I am thrilled with my necklace!It's just the right size. It's dainty and beautiful. I hope the chain doesnt break, as what happened with other buyer-reviewers here in Amazon.I just love my necklace. I hope they do this in 18 carat white gold."
1,Perfect length. I love this necklace it completes my family. I wear it everyday. It has a beautiful box chain. Any mother would love this necklace I love the beautiful gift box it came in. I have nothing negative to say about this necklace.
1,"Gave this to my mom when I got married as a reminder that our family isn't changing...we're just adding more people! Anyway, she loves it and wears it pretty much all the time (which is strange, because she actually wears jewelry very rarely!). It's abstract enough that even someone who doesn't like a lot of other &#34;Mom&#34; things really loved it. Also high quality and very pretty."
1,"granddaughter loved it ,we purchased it for her birthday,had it sent to her home so she was really surprised :-)"
1,I always wanted this necklace! Took me forever to finally get one for myself. It is beautiful and I ordered another for someone who is having her first child.
1,strong. durable and light enough that I can sleep with it around my neck at night and not get choked. I wear it in the shower
1,"What you see is exactly what you get. The description and size are right on. So, if you like the picture, you will love the necklance. It is a beautiful pendant. It's a great depiction of a mother and two children. I just love it."
1,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my mother. I loved it and so did she. I asked my husband to get one for me for my birthday.
1,"Bought this for mothers day and my wife loved it, came in a nice box and looks very nice."
1,Got it as a mother's day gift for my mother-in-law. She loves it. I love how they have all different families. I got my own mom the 2 parents 3 children one. Both moms loved their necklaces.
1,"I was very impressed with the value I received with this product! The charm is beautiful. The chain looks as though you'd pay a lot more for it than what it costs. I have been wearing mine everyday for about 6 months, and all it needs is an occasional shine with a silver polishing rag. Looks like it did the day I received it. I really like the looks of the chain - very unique. Unfortunately, it tends to kink ever-so-slightly. The easy solution is to lay the chain out flat on a hard surface. Gently roll a glass over the chain from one end to the other. This will flatten out any kinks. But, the kinks are not very noticable when you're wearing it."
0,"I didn't like it, the picture on the website made it look bigger than it appears. It looks like children's jewelry."
1,I received this as a gift from my three sons. It's is beautiful. It is sturdy and thick. I have gotten many compliments on it.
1,"Very nice pendant, well made, heavier than expected (in a good way). Chain that comes with is thin, but nice and clasp wirks well."
1,"I purchased this Loving Family Necklace for my Mom for Mother's Day. They come with all different size families and really send a strong, caring message. She cried. ;-)"
1,I bought this last year for my mother at Christmas and she loved it. Her house was broken into and they stole all of her jewelry! She was very sad this piece was gone. So I gave it to her again the following Christmas.
1,"My husband bought me one of the necklaces, but with two parents and two children. I love mine so much. I ordered this one for my friend. She is going through a difficult divorce and is now on her own with 3 kids. I am going to give it to her for Valentines day. I do not think they look cheap at all, infact the pendant seems to be very well made. It has a beautiful satin finish. The chain is short, but I like to have necklaces of different lengths depending on what I am wearing. My friend and I both work in the medical field and wear scrubs all day. The length of the chain is perfect for our uniforms as it falls right in the V-neck and is easily seen. I read a couple of the other reviews and I saw that a couple of comments were made about the chain getting caught in the sheet or breaking in the nigh, there is a simple remedy to that. TAKE IT OFF BEFORE GOING TO BED! Hope this helps. Also if you are a man, thinking of buying it-go for it. Even though it is inexpensive-women love sentimental things!"
1,"I GAVE THIS FIVE STARS It was exactally what was shown!! Packaging was awesome. The necklace and penant was in a plastic bag inside a very nice box, that will make &#34;your &#34; mom wonder what awesome gift she is receving...it doesn't even need to be wrapped .....but for xmas I will wrap it. This is also a great gift for your wife whom has beared your children...this is one of the special gifts that I am urgently waiting for my wife to open...note the cost is great for what you are getting a huge smile from your loved one...."
1,I bought this to put in daughter's book bag in case to store her hearing aids and related tools. The small pockets are nice for holding extra batteries and the bag in the middle is perfect for protecting the hearing aids from the rest of the cleaning tools. She loves that it's purple to match her book bag.
1,"Bought these as a gift for the wife. They will be a great addition to adding variety to her diamond stud or pearl earrings. It will take a plain diamond stud, and change it instantly into something glamorous. Definitely a great addition to her jewelry box."
1,"This bracelet was awesome.... better than expected. The recipient loved it. Wish I would've gotten one for myself. I would totally recommend this for anyone & I'm not even a big jewelry person, but loved the simple elegance of this piece."
0,Lovely bracelet if you like a clear look with a hint of color. The picture presented is clearly showing a light color of aquamarie. The bracelet received looks clear.
0,"For my taste too small and pale looking for 130 dollars, three stars because is not that expensive."
0,I can't describe this item...BECAUSE I NEVER RECIEVED IT! This company has not shipped my item and its been a weekafter the due date! Never again will I buy from Celtic merchants!
0,"I order this book for my wife to go with her new flexshaft. I could not believe that they charged $30.00 for this booklet.Granted there are not many buyers for this item, but certainly $ 30.00 it is too much.In the positive side,there is good information provided and it is a good intoduction to the use of this tool."
1,"Wow, so many more uses for my flexshaft that I didn't realize. Easy to read. Well done."
1,"Great design, great price, great delivery. Will buy another for the boyfriend.Only caveat, most jewelers will not re-size surgical steel rings."
1,I BOUGHT THIS RING FOR MY BOYFRIEND FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. IT FIT PERFECTLY AND HE LOVES IT AND WEARS IT ALL THE TIME.
1,I went through a slight Athena craze and bought this necklace. It is very well made and the length is perfect. It was a good buy and I really enjoy it.
0,"I made the mistake of buying this for $40 from another site. It's a great item, made to last (though the gold can rub off the edges a bit), and the pewter's also lead-free- another perk.This is one of the best Anubis pendants I've seen, and I've worn mine daily for well over a year and a half now, and it's in relatively good condition. Word of warning- don't drop pink sherbet on it by accident; I can't get the sherbet spill off, so the ankh is pink! ;)"
1,I got this in the mail today and it is beautiful! It is even engraved on the back. I like the dimensions as it is not gaudy looking and can be worn discreetly with any ensemble.
1,I was very pleased with the appearance this product. The one downfall was how it rests on the neckline when wearing it. It kind of sticks out more on the top then on the bottom and I think because of that the necklace will flip around a lot more frequently. It is very lovely and I love how it came with all of the birthstones to fill however we choose.
0,"Love the look of this locket, but would like the clasp to be better. I have 5 stones in the locket and it does not close all of the way. The chain keeps it from opening and loosing the stones, but it would be better if it closed properly."
1,I love this! I just ordered 2 and it is beautiful and did not fall apart its just right in the size and the stones are darling! I would recommend it highly.. I think the price was worth it because in a jewelry store it would be a lot more. I love jewelry and this is definitely a great FIND. JUST BEAUTFUL!
1,"I got this for my mom for Christmas, not sure if she would like it because I am the youngest of her children and I am 21 years old. However she reminded me that your kids are always your kids and she loved it. Wears it all the time. It was bigger than I expected, I was worried it would look to small, but it looks really nice."
1,"After much deliberation I finally chose this for my step daughter. She just recently gave birth to a new baby girl. She has 2 boys also. I thought that something would be in order such as a mother's ring or the such. I order the pendant/locket. The delivery was quicker than stated, which I felt was a plus. Upon receiving it, my wife open it and sent me pictures. (I work offshore so unable to be there for the giving.) After some difficulty she was able to get 5 stones inside the locket, but after reading the description I knew that it wold be difficult to do but could be done. She gave it to our daughter and she was very pleased with it. I have yet to actually look at in person, but from the raves I have gotten from those who have I think it will have been a good buy. I will post more once it has been worn a while and survived her work."
1,I thought this locket was lovely. I like it very much. I was afraid at first after looking at the photo on here thinking the stones may fall out if the locket were to pop open. But I just recieved it and the necklace is what keeps the locket closed. I'm very happy with it. It is beautiful.
1,"I gave this to my mother in law for Christmas for the grandkids. as long as us kids don't have multiple birthdays in one month, it should be great. I had a hard time opening the locket, then realized it has to be off the chain first. This I'm sure is to ensure that it will not open and the birthstones will not be lost."
1,I bought this for my sister for mommy's day. She has two young boys. I loved it and I know she will too. I don't have kids of my own but I almost wanted to keep it for myself.
1,"Purchased this locket for my Mother for Mother's Day and she loved it! Even had a compliment on it! Hopefully,I get one for a special occasion-would love it!!!!"
1,"These daisy earrings are very well made and so pretty. They are substantial without being too big, and they look great with my dark hair. Now I want the rest of the Daisy set."
1,"This Cross is amazing! the color is great, it's put together well with one exception the chain is very short. Other than that My Aunt loved it, it was a Christmas gift for her and she loved it."
1,"When I recieved this band I couldn't believe that the diamonds were as big as they are ! The price was right and the diamond band was better than I had hoped for, I really love it."
0,"like previously mentioned, the rings are sized a bit large. the diamonds are not the best quality but for the price it is expected. you can't tell from the picture but the two strips of gold forming the channel for the diamonds actually sticks up a little. from the side the ring does not make a perfect circle but a slight oval shape. it's not necessarily bad, just different. My girlfriend really liked the ring, but if i had to do it again i would spend a little more money and get a ring of nicer quality. if you are planning on buying the ring, i suggest going a half size, maybe even a size smaller."
1,These are well made and matched. I needed a small earring for a small person who has really small ear lobes. Most other designs were sort of ho-hum. But these look a lot more expensive than they were. The color is deep blue with goldish flecks (fools gold) in them and a slight white line running through one of them. But that just makes them look genuine and I don't count that as a flaw. These will make a great gift and I highly recommend. These you will not see out there everywhere !
1,"Very pretty earrings. The blue color is exactly what I had expected and after reading other reviews I was not expecting them to be HUGE earrings so I was happy with their size, about an inch from the top of the earring (not the wire)to the bottom of the lapis. They are just right for everyday wear or somewhere special."
1,"I was looking for something unique to compliment a blue dress for my upcomming engagement photos and I think I nailed it, truly lovely and one of a kind, I wore it to work the day I got it and was getting complements all day! my soon to be mother-in-law said she might even buy one."
1,Receive these earrings with fantastic shipping time. Gorgeous packaging. These are my new favorite every day earrings! They are the perfect size for a woman with long or short hair!
0,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas because I have been wanting one really bad. He got the 16 inch chain..big mistake! It is too small for my liking and it looks very cheap! It is not a finer chain it looks like something I would give to a child. Well thats ok I will just exchange it for one of my own, well that can not happen because the hole is too small to allow you to exchange necklaces...UGH!! The pendent itself is cute and well made not cheap or thin...just wish they never put that chain on it!!! If it wasnt for me not wanting to upset my husband I would return this in a heartbeat! Wow I just reviewed the order...looks like my hubby ordered the 18 inch chain but we got a 16 inch chain...that I measured to make sure!"
1,"I encourage everyone to order an item from Eve's Addiction. They will do the very best to make you happy and to insurethat you are pleased with any item you order. They have fantastic customer service, which is very hard to find these days.Shop and order now. You will not be disappointed."
1,"This beautiful necklace was purchased as a gift for a young lady, and we were very pleased with our purchase. It is delicate, detailed, and very expensive looking. A great value for the price."
0,"Earrings are ok, however clasp is very long so that earrings slide forward and clasp is visable when looking at front of earring"
0,I ordered these earrings for a friend for her birthday knowing she would love them. She certainly did and they look lovely in her ears. I did expect the earrings to be a bit heavier for the money but they were good.[...]
1,"I got the one for my son's new little truck and it is so beautiful. I know it just is a piece of plastic, but the symbol itheGOD and his Angels represted for me and my love for my son. I am terminally ill cancer and I need my touch on his truck and life and he can look at it and see my love for him to and GODS love we all need LOVE everyday a must Have item. for or loved ones."
1,I was very skeptical of ordering sight unseen but could not of been more happy with what I received. My daughter loves it! For the quality and the price you cannot go wrong with this pendant!
0,"The ring is cute, but it was too big. Tried contacting seller about return and got no response."
1,"Obviously if you sit on your butt and wait for the postman to make your dreams come true this won't do much, but if you put energy into the world to make things happen, this amulet definitely enhances the results you get from the energy you put out."
1,"I've ordered the same ring previously about a year ago, but managed to lose it one day. I liked the ring so much, though, that I came back and ordered a new one because I couldn't find another like it with the same quality anywhere else for such a great price. I love this ring!"
0,when you put it on the stones start falling out - it's beautiful - just hope I don't lose all the stones!
1,I already owned one of these and recommended it for a friend. That is who it was ordered for and she is pleased with the item.
0,This product is grossly represented. No carrying case or instructions. Made of cheap plastic including the clasp which i would be surprised of it even works. I had a metal one but umfortunately lost it. Not even worth the trouble of returning.
1,"This item is indespensable for any lady who loves to wear bracelets. With this you can actually get your bracelets on WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE helping you. Even if you've become pretty good at getting your bracelets on by yourself anyway, this item allows you to do it really fast and easy. Older women will especially love it. My mom gave me mine and I liked it so much I bought 6 for my friends. :)"
1,Great for us single gals who don't have someone to help us put our jewelry on. Now I can do it myself.
1,I purchased the bracelet buddy because I do have trouble at times putting on some of my braclets with the clasps. This really helps.
0,"Made out of very cheap material, but it does work. I do not think it will last long if used often."
1,This is a great little tool. I have had difficulty in getting my bracelet on and don't like relying on other sor help. The bracelet buddy has solved my issue. Thank you!
0,"Items is great, just over priced! easy to use, makes getting my bracelet on mush easier, but thought it was a bit over priced."
1,This is absolutely the greatest thing since sliced bread. I no longer rely on someone else to help me with my bracelets. It is great!
0,This product didn't work for me the tip is cheap and plastic and it does not clamp on well to jewerly. I sent it back. Ladies find one with a metal tip.
0,"I already reviewed this product, totally disappointed would be very Leary to buy anything else on line. A big waste of money. If anyone cares!!!"
1,This is a lovely quality charm. I put mine on a silver chain and it is just beautiful. It was better quality than I expected and can be worn alone or put on a charm bracelet.It is much prettier in person than on the photo.
1,"This was bought for use as jewelry, not a toy. As jewelry, its very pretty and looks great on my daughter. It looks even better than the pictures."
1,This product arrived very quickly. The service and the product were excellent. I would certainly order from this company again.
1,"I was surprised at how dramatic yet clean-lined the design was. The saphires were darker colored an more intense than I anticipated. A very good value to my mind, although I don't buy jewlery much so I'm not a good judge of price."
1,"My wife simply loves this item.. She loves the multi-color beads. Nice. She wears it with jeans or a nice pants suit. Again, nice"
0,"I gasped when I first saw it online, it was so beautiful. After receiving it though, it was heavier, and wider than I had wanted. The company charges a $40 restocking fee on returned items, so I kept it."
1,We bought this ring as a wedding band for myself. In person it is absolutely gorgeous! I was so excited to see it and am very happy that we decided to buy it! I love that they mixed silver and gold to make it more affordable. Customer service was amazing and helpful and shipping was fast! We highly recommend this and the Allegra ring as wedding bands!
0,"This came quickly and was a great price. It's very pretty and sparkley when you first get it. However, the so-called gold plating came off almost immediately and it now looks silver. When that happens it turns your belly black around your piercing. However the belly ring still looks pretty and it was so cheap that, really, what can one expect? Maybe if you take it off before showering the gold might last longer. That seemed to be when most of it came off of mine."
1,this thing is soooo sparkly and shiny!! It fits great was packaged very well and looks great against my fair skin! It doesn't itch or create any issues for my belly button! and the Gold looks good with the stone!
1,"Both of these products are the BEST. If you have a silver grill, they will keep it shiny and looking like new."
0,"I love hoops and wanted large gold hoops. I received them as a gift and they are toooooo flimsy and I will loose one as I too have already pulled it out of my ear by moving my hair. The product should be about $20, it is only 14K and VERY THIN. I am dissatisfied with this product and would not buy from seller again."
1,It was exactly what I was looking for. Bought it for my husband and it looks perfect on him. Thank you!
1,"I was given this exact ring as a teenager by friend's of my mothers', and pawned it for $20-to my everlasting shame. Having looked for a replacement to no avail, for so long that I almost given up...amazing that seven years later I just stumble upon it here on Amazon. Thanks."
1,Here's my story
1,This was a great gift idea! It is super sleek and professional looking at a great price. Once again I am impressed with Harris Michael products.
1,"My new malachite ring is beautiful! It is much higher quality than anticipated. I love it!I do wish it was 1/4 size smaller -- as I am not a ""gent"" and wear it on my middle finger which, ideally, is a size 8 3/4. Although that has nothing to do with quality and I will certainly make another purchase from this vendor."
1,"Sterling Silver Dragon Charm, 2 1/8"" (54mm) TallA beautiful piece of celtic work."
0,"I received these earrings quickly and well packaged. However pretty they are, they are much smaller than I anticipated. I guess that's my fault for not looking at the sizing. Not sure if I'll keep as they aren't very big, and I don't like huge earrings. They kind of disappear in my hair."
1,Great earings- Light weight and different purple hues allow for wear with many different shades of purple. Very happy with purchase! Would recommend!
1,"I was very pleased with these when I received them, but I have purchased 1928 jewelry in the past and knew they would be good quality. Beautiful beading and detail, perfect length and drop. I wear them constantly and often get compliments on them. Some of my favorite earrings as they can be dressed up or down."
1,"I love these earrings. They look great with almost anything; casual, professional and everything in between. These would make a great gift!"
1,"This ring is gorgeous. I received it today and was very impressed by its quality. The diamonds are bigger than I thought and clear. The color is great too. It is colorless to my eye and the setting is beautiful. I am very satisfied with this ring, in terms of the price I paid."
1,I love this charm!! It is so pretty and I always get complements when I wear it. I would certainly recommend this to anyone.
1,This is so small! I love it! I thought it was going to be bigger but I love that it's the size that it is. I bought it for my boyfriend because he's obsessed with airplanes and he put it on his keychain and loves it too. There is no back It's just empty but that's no problem. It's very good quality I believe and I dont regret my purchase at alll (:
1,I absolutely love this ring. The silver is lightweight making it easily worn. The design is remarkable and the photograph does not do enough justice. The stone is as beautiful as I imagined it would be. The sizing ( I ordered an 8 ) was true to the precise fit as compared to my other size 8 rings. The price is absolute in the worth of the ring. When I ordered this ring I was not under any type of false impression that I was going to get *more* for my money's worth. I observed the product considered the price and paid for exactly what I wanted. A low cost magnificent ring with a lovely amber stone in sterling silver with a unique design. That's exactly what I bought and I absolutely love it. I am highly satisfied and it arrived to me from the dealer much quicker then imagined considering I only paid for standard shipping. And to add icing on the cake; everyone is already giving me great compliments!! So I recommend them to come here. Hope this review was straight to the point in helping someone with their purchase.
0,"It broke before I could get it out of the box. I did manage to fix it, but the wood that holds the drawers in place came loose before it was put together also. I had to reglue them. It is very pretty though."
0,"Nice armoire for the price. The finish could be a little neater, there were some drip edges at the bottom, but not noticeable unless you are looking for it. The drawers don't slide as nicely as they should. It was shipped well packed, and unpacked without any problems. Love the style and design. Only wish that one drawer was dedicated to rings rather than the small top section. All in all, decent for the price."
1,This is a well made jewelry armoire. It it a great mahogany color and went together very easily. My wife is very picky and she found nothing wrong with it. Great product for the price.
1,"Bought this for my stepdaughter who is into scuba diving ""big time""!! She just loves it!!"
1,"This ring is everything I hoped for,& more.The fit is perfect,the color is absolutely amazing.The aquamarine is the richest I think I've ever seen."
1,I was so delighted upon opening the pretty gift box. The pendant is a perfect size. It is well made and highly polished. The cz's are very clear and sparkle. I received my order quickly and it arrived in perfect condition through the USPS! This pendant would make any lady/girl a perfect gift for any occasion. I tried to buy this exact pendant with my initial last Christmas but they had already sold out so of course I was really happy to be able to snag it this time! :) You cannot go wrong with this quality pendant or Gem Avenue service.
1,I got what I ordered. consider buying the chain at the same time. However It beutifule and exactly what I wanted!!
1,"I was very satisfied with this pendant. It met all my expectation, was delivered as promised, and had a great price."
1,I bought this for my mom for Mothers Day & presented it to her over lunch out at a local Casino. It didn't bring her any luck at the slots but she thought it was great! It's not fancy but it's not pricey either. You get what you pay for and my Mom liked it just fine!
1,"My daughter loves to play school in the basement, she has had a great time with these supplies. They are fun to hand out."
1,The product arrived quickly and in great condition. It looks better than I expected. Playing School is so much more real!
1,I bought this as a part of my child's christmas present. She loves playing teacher and I am sure this will make it more fun!
1,I bought this product for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play school. She loves this! All of her friends love it too!
1,I bought this for my great nephew. He has two younger sisters and he always thinks he has to teach them what to do. He will probably love the report card and give them bad grades. Thanks
1,Pretend and Play School Seta gift to my 5 year old granddaughter for christmas 2008. she loves it and plays with it all the time very educational. also have the supplies that i ordered extra and stamp set....i give it a 5 star toy.
1,I purchased this for my nine-year-old granddaughter who loves to play school. She was thrilled with the materials that she could add to her classroom!
1,"My 8 year old daughter, who loves to play school, absolutely loves this set. It has multiple copies of school papers and they are a smaller size, good for use with dolls as the students!"
1,I've had this for over 6 months and it still looks brand new even though I've never taken it off. It's really cute and not heavy like most dangle belly rings.
1,"My Dad, who has been gone now for 5 years, started a tradition of buying charms for my Mom to mark major life events. When he passed I took on that tradition and with the help if this seller have been able to build her bracelet into a cherished family heirloom.Gorgeous little charm, great price, well made. Thank you for helping to preserve these memories."
0,I ordered this on seeing the image. It looked quite attractive given its sleek design for everyday use. But i was pretty surprised when i received this. The pendant is unusually small and the chain isn't long enough.Not worthy enough of its given price.
1,This charm is cuter in person than it is on the blurry pic that's posted for the item description. I purchased this charm to attach it to my charm bracelet. It's the first one of many. I am very happy with my purchase!
1,The cupcake was gorgeous but the chain was so thin it arrived all tangled I wound up tossing it and using another gold chain. I loved the cupcake itself. It was worth the money even without the chain.
0,"With such glowing reviews, I really expected this to be a nice necklace. The diamonds are dull; you can barely see them and the chain will have to be replaced. This was not super expensive, but for $100 - I definitely expected more than this necklace. So far, I've been ashamed to even give this as a gift!"
0,The item is much smaller than I expected. Please tell me how to return it.
1,Ordered this for my best friend as a birthday gift. It was even more beautiful in person. It is petite and cute but with plenty of sparkle. She loves it and wears it all the time.
1,"There is always a tremendous mark-up in jewelry but this necklace represented a good value. It's well executed and my lady friend loved it. The chain was perhaps a bit too delicate for the pendant.10k Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant w/ Cupcake Box (.05 cttw, I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity), 18"""
0,It was nice. It came in a ceramic cupcake but the hinge was broken and it was poorly crafted but I was buying the pendant
0,"The pendant is worth the money, it looks good. But like everyone else has said...the chain comes in a tangled mess. I had to trash it."
0,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift. When I received it the glass Cupcake container it comes in was broken. The lid was stuck and was cracked all around. After finally getting it opened I was shocked. I understand they show things LARGER than they are BUT this was SMALL,SMALL,SMALL..... I returned it with no problems..... If the cupcake on the necklace would have been larger I would have just exchanged it but was not in my opinion worth the money. I would recommend this only to someone who would be buying for a small child that way the cupcake looks LARGER."
1,Sterling Silver 1.00mm Fancy Pendant Chain Necklace (Available in Different Sizes)This chain looks very delicate and seems to be of fine quality. It works very well with the teardrop crystal pendents. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
1,"I love goldstone, it's understated while still being elegant and just plain beautiful. This bracelet combines the beauty of the stone with a design I have not seen before in a bracelet of this type. I will enjoy wearing this!"
1,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It arrived in great time and my wife really loves it. It matches her other Unakite pieces very well. This is my 3rd purchase from Gem Avenue, and all purchases have been great."
1,"I ordered these very pretty earrings for my roommate as her xmas present and she absolutly loved them. When I recieved them in the mail, they were smaller than I had expected but they were very pretty. The cubic zerconia's go all the way around the earring and they must be very comfortable because I dont see a day go by that my roommate doesnt wear them!"
1,"Runs true to size, and mine is pretty close to picture in appearance. I wear it almost everyday! It's a really pretty ring!"
1,"I bought this ring for my girlfriend as a promise ring. She absolutely loves it and wears it everyday. Excellent quality, packaging, and very fast delivery."
1,"am very pleased with my purchase, speedy shipping will use again"
1,This necklass is beautiful and the quality great. Vendor shipped the product quickly. I love it.
0,I down rated this ring due to the sharp ends of the Ankhs. I don't wear it much because it catched on clothes & other items.
0,"It's very hard to rate this product. The instructions are minimal. I bought it for dentures but, can't tell about it's process. I find the dentures somewhat cleaner but am concerned about the product itself. How frequently should the powder solution be changed? Does something need to be done to clean the product? What is the powder for (is it for jewelry, instruments, dentures or all of the above)? What are appropriate settings for various items? Would denture powder work in the machine? There are about two lines of directions and that's not enough"
1,"I bought this ultrasonic cleaner to clean jewelry. I was so pleased with the way the jewelry came out, I threw in other metal stuff (tweezers, etc.).What I am the happiest with is how my glasses come out of it! I can put 2-3 paris in at a time and they come out looking perfect!!I have also cleaned my husband's watch.This unit is good for everything!"
0,35 Watts maybe just isn't enough power. I am very disappointed with the outcome after using it. It didn't clean anything much at all. I would let this one go!
0,This doesnt seem to clean at all. I think you have to pay the money and get your jewelry professionally done
1,I have had ultra sonic jewelery cleaners for years...this is my 3rd one. It is also the least expensive one and it does a terrific job. I use mine every day for whatever jewelery I am wearing and my eye glasses. My husband uses it too. I bought this one about 6 months ago and buying one for my granddaughter for Christmas.Joanie V
1,I bought this chain to wear with a marlin pendant from the same seller.I use it for all my loose pendants and it works perfect.Nice quality and I'll most likely buy it in other lengths.
1,"The ring fits true to size. The craftsmanship is beautiful, very exquisite looking. The price was worth it.Has not tarnished or left any markings on my skin. The band does not bend, the metal is not soft and keeps its shape."
1,"Lovely chain and great price. I am fond of Silver jewelry because of the shine and the low price compared to the price of gold these days. I prefer yellow gold and always will, but I have been priced out of my hearts desire. LOL&lt;heavy sigh> But, be that as it may this is a great chain at a great price. It was delivered promptly and so I was pleased."
1,"I bought this alittle over a year ago & LOVE it! I wear it with a slightly longer snake chain with a pendant & they look awesome together. This would also be great on its own though. I've had it on almost everyday since I bought it & it looks just as it did on day one! Can't go wrong with this chain. Pretty, shiny, sturdy, nice weight."
0,"Shipping was very quick. It's a cute little ring. However, the ring is not as pictured. There is no antique finish to highlight details."
1,A very nice sturdy ring. i bought this ring when i lost my claddagh. its strong and looks very nice on the hand. would make a great gift for any lady
1,"It is a very shiny silver, but I think it looks lovely, not cheap. It's definitely sterling silver - just as sturdy as another sterling silver ring of mine - and the craftsmanship is very beautiful. The 'crown' looks a little cheesy, as it's sitting atop the heart without touching it at all, but otherwise it is a very nice, simple kind of ring with a bit of a Celtic flair. :3It doesn't look like the tarnished antique you see in the picture except in design, though. Just as a warning~"
1,"This was for my daughter and she loves it.I thought it was beautiful,shipped fast and was packed very good. very satisfied."
0,"[...]To give this ring credit, it has a very nice curvy shape that compliments any diamond. Unfortunately looks aren't everything. The craftsmanship of this ring is extremely poor. The ridges around the diamonds are riddled with irregular gashes easily visible to the naked eye, as are the backs of the arcs. The diamonds are so small that they are barely even visible in the picture and in real life unless they are under some diamond lights. This is indicated in the .26 Ctw though so it shouldn't be a surprise. The worst part of this ring is the back, it is extremely thin and weak. I had my diamond mounted on the ring and inspected it closely after getting it back to make sure everything was right. Later that day I proposed and while removing the ring from my fiancee's hand and pulling slightly the back broke completely through in the thinnest part, which is about a millimeter. The amount of force involved was negligible.Now I have to get it repaired but it will just break again, so I have to get it reinforced and if that doesn't work I will have to buy a quality ring. And of course the 30 day return policy is useless because it is voided once the ring has been altered. In summary, I am extremely dissapointed with this product and its jeweler."
0,"I originally purchased the 8mm ring as a wedding band for my fiance, and exchanged it for the 5mm ring per his request. We were married 2 months later, and the ring turned out to be too big (not sure if the person sizing his finger wasn't accurate, or the ring was a little larger than a size 8). I requested to exchange the ring for a smaller size, and the company refused because I had already exchanged the ring once and 2 months had passed.Personally, I think 2 months for a man's wedding ring is acceptable considering the groom doesn't wear the ring as soon as it is received (who wants to fret over the wedding band arriving on time?). I also think that exchanging the ring once for preference and once for size is not terribly inappropriate, considering it's a wedding band.Granted, I can fork over another $20 for a different ring, but will certainly find it somewhere else."
1,This ring is an excellent buy. It replaced my gold band that was uncomfortable and would leave sores on my finger. I stopped wearing my original band some time ago and my wife pestered me until I finally got a replacement. I now wear this all the time - no discomfort at all! I love the weight and feel. I have also had several compliments regarding the ring.Only caution - I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than my original and glad I did. The comfort fit design is a bit looser than traditional rings - and you cannot have this ring sized afterwards.
1,"Had this ring for about 2 months now. I break rings. So I needed something strong. Ring still looks like the day we received it! And I bang mine, abuse it to all ends. (Not on purpose. Just my line of work) I get complimented all the time. You just get married? I said no, been married for over a year. (But just got the rings a couple months ago) They ask if I just put it on. I answer with a smile ""no"" I wear it all the time. They are amazed at how shiny and knick free it is. I would highly recommend this product. Sabrina Silver was were we bought ours on here and very professional seller."
1,"I bouth it to save my wedding ring, actually I preffer this one, looks great and last forever shining ...First I bought the 5mm ring, it fits excellent, then I order the same in size 4 and 6mm, usually change everyday each size but all are excellent options. Tungsten Carbide is an excellent material for wedding rings, last forever ...I really enjoy to use those rings every day."
1,"Is a great ring. Holds up very well, more then I would have thought. Keeps a shine. Great value."
1,"This is a great ring and the comfort fit is perfect!! I also ordered the size 6 in this ring, for my roommate/partner, but came to find out that it wasn't available. The seller contacted me and was able to substitute another ring, same size, almost the same ring, except that it is a little wider. The shipping was fast and the seller is very professional. I would definitely recommed this seller and would buy from them again."
1,"I bought one of these almost 4 years ago for my 3 year anniversary. I had REALLY messed up my gold ring over the previous three years so my wife got me something tough and scratch resistant. I've been wearing the ring almost 24/7 for the past 4 years and it doesn't even have a scratch on it doing the same stuff that messed up my gold ring. Only negative is that the ring doesn't grow like my fat fingers do, so I'm going to be getting another one in a larger size. As long as they haven't changed the way the rings are made, I expect to wear the next ring as long as it fits and will never get a scratch on it either. I bought the first one at $34 and now they're only $14 so I'm psyched about that too. Heck, I might even buy the next two sizes up just to be safe!"
1,it is true. tungsten carbide is indestructible and will last forever. i've been wearing this ring daily for over 2 years and it still looks and feels the same as the day i bought it. in fact it is so comfortable to wear i sometimes forget i have it on. still looks brand new and not a scratch on it. definitely worth the money i paid and will last a lifetime.
1,This ring fit perfectly and it is absolutely the most wonderful thing to be wearing if you do alot of work with your hands. I wear mine almost everyday and save my more expensive bands with stones for special occasions. This ring has yet to get any scratches and it is shiny and very comfortable. It is more of a grey than a silver but very nice. I am super happy with mine and i can't believe they are so inexpensive for the quality!
1,I bought this ring for myself in November 2011. (I also bought Husband the 8mm) I can't be happier!! There is not a mark on it yet and I am not gentle on my rings! And how great Husbands still looks truely amazes me! True to size for comfort fit bands. ((A word of caution....There is no way to cut a tungsten ring off! They have to be smashed/cracked off with vise-grips so do NOT try to force one on that is too small!!)) I wish I could give more that 5 stars!!!
1,"I was tired of resizing the wedding ring I was married with, but I still wanted to wear a ring. I found this one surfing Amazon, and liked the looks and reviews, so I tried it out. The ring is a really cool greyish color, depending on the light it can look black or light gray. It is very shiny. I had not worn a comfort fit ring before, my gold ring is a regular fit, this one is far more comfortable. The width takes a little getting used to, but it's not sharp like my other ring, I wouldn't go back. I used the method described on the web to determine my ring size, and based on the other reviews ordered one half size smaller, it's a perfect fit. The ring is fairly heavy, there is a lot of metal in this ring. I'm very happy with it, and wear it every day, I hardly know it's there."
1,"Great ring, well polished, fits perfectly. Great customer service, fast delivery. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again and again."
1,"Amazing! Nicer than the ones I've seen in stores selling for more than $175. Arrived very quick (4 days), and I'm in the northeast."
1,"This is truly a great ring. Looks great, feels great, extremely scratch resistant, what more can a say. I've been asked if it was platinum by several people. Definitely the best value out there."
1,"I liked the item very much, but was too big for mine ankle. Gave it to my GrandDaughter"
0,I was so eager to purchase this ring - read the few comments which are usually a great help.. but not this time...When i got the ring i loved it - it was bigger than expected but attractive.. but then i wore it for the 2nd time for less than 2 hrs and just touched a handle and crakleeee it went - fell on the floor in like 5 pieces... i was sooo upset... you could well imagine...after all the trouble i went to getting this ring.... i did not even wear it daily... three times like i said for less than 4 hrs - in total... 7 hrs in 3 days.... it is a veryyyyyyyyyyyyy breakable item.. ok.. not sturdy at all.. only a ontime wear...
1,I absolutely love this ring. It is vibrant and colorful. I have received several compliments on it. The size I ordered perfectly fits the finger I wanted to wear it on. It also adds a nice pop of color to any outfit. Makes a great gift as well.
1,"The silver on the ring looks darker on the photo here, so I was a little surprised when I received it.Overall, I love it! I can't wait to wear it out to meet friends.My only complaint would be the back part of the ring. I know it looks weird because they have different sizes for it, but eh, I mean, who's going to look at the back part of my ring anyway?"
1,"I have had this ring for a few years now and I love it. I was looking for something to acknowledge my Irish heritage and satisfy my inner fantasy geek, this ring does it! The band gets a bit thin on the underside but it's held it's shape well and makes it very comfortable to wear.I've received several compliments on it over the years, not that I'm looking for them but it speaks to the cool factor of the ring.My ring size has shrunk, so I'm glad to see the ring is still available!"
1,I love this ring. It is very comfortable and is still very attractive after i have been wearing it for a year. Great product.
1,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my Mother, her birthstone is an opal. The earrings were inexpensive and look great. The present went over very well and I would recommend this product and company to others."
0,"I received this ring as a birthday present and love the design! I immediately put it on, and within a day the opening would randomly open when I moved my hand which is quite annoying. I didn't plan on keeping anything in it, but as I said it does get annoying, and although I could just glue or solder is shut, that defeats the purpose of the ring."
0,You'll have to solder it shut if you put anything in it and want to keep it. It's not well make and a little on the cheap side. Thankfully the person I bought it for was able to solder his shut.
1,"I love this ring-- I wore one for almost 4 years before losing it (so I'm here to get another!).For those of you who accidentally drop it, these instructions accurately illustrate how I put mine back together:[...]There's a little trick though, the 2 pieces that form the X shape across the front only fit in one configuration, so if they don't fit together perfectly, drop the piece on the rightmost side and bring it back up to be on the left hand side of the piece you're still holding. This should rearrange the pieces so that they will twist together correctly.Once you get the hang of it you can put it together in seconds."
1,I love this ring. I purchased it from Amazon about a year ago and I wear it everyday. I get many compliments about the ring. I would recommend this ring to anywho who is into silver.
0,The clasp on this thing is very cheap and will seperate from the cord within a few months.My wife found me a couple of other necklaces that have lasted 3 times as long and cost a fraction of this item.
1,great necklace only one issue the clasp was small and hard to put together but once you get adjusted to it not so tough
0,"This looked great when it came, but broke in only one day. REALLY poor craftmanship."
1,"I love this leather chain~ it comes in different lengths and in brown, too. It looks great with big silver pendants and my turquoise pendants. They look great layered too~ just be very careful with the catch on it however, I've found it can break pretty easily. A stronger catch would be excellent but if you are careful with it, it's no problem. Great price for the value!"
0,"It would be my suggestion to those of you looking for jewelry on Amazon to NOT buy from Peora....they falsely advertise that their jewelry is ""sterling silver""....but it is in fact NOT. I passed over several rings that I really liked because they were only ""sterling silver plated"" and not actual silver, the one I chose was supposed to be REAL silver (not plated), but the first time I cleaned it with jewelry cleaner, *specially made for sterling silver*, it turned and is now PERMANENTLY tarnished. Unfortunately for me I was out of town at the time and was not able to send the item back, and I am now stuck w/ a birthstone ring that is FAKE!! I am extremely disappointed and if I could have given NO STARS, I would have!!"
0,"I loved the chain initially,especially for the price. Shortly after the chain started looking brownish-yellow loosing all shine. I placed it in jewlery cleaner, to no avail. you can not tell if the chain is real silver."
0,I ordered four and they were all nice looking but the littlest one as soon as I tried the clasp the clasp broke. The ones that did not break are really great.
0,"Started tarnishing the day I opened it. I've had it for three months and it looks like an old, ugly, gold chain; when it started out as a sparkly, shiny, silver chain! Don't get it unless you're prepared with Silver Jewelry cleaner on hand."
1,"I was kinda skeptical about this ""cheap"" chain, I figured that it would arrive looking like something out of a 25 cent machine. Boy, was I wrong. Every review has been dead on, it's georgous, dosen't kink, and looks like it costed a lot more. I've worn it everyday, and gotten tons of compliments on it. best of all, it came 4 days sooner than expected. I ordered the 22"" chain, and it's perfect. don't pass this up! it's worth a lot more than it costs!"
1,"This is a really nice chain. For the price I paided I expected something very cheap, but I was very wrong. It shined in the light and it's just a beautiful chain. This is a perfect buy if your looking for a 925 chain, but not looking to pay a lot of money."
1,"I like to layer pendents on different length chains. These chains are very attractive, and well made. They are well worth the price."
1,"Elegant, reasonably priced, a clasp that isn't a pain to open, and it doesn't snag my hair. Great."
1,I am still wearing it after a month. This necklace is stronger than it looks..A very good value for the price!
1,This is a very nice chain and just what I was looking for. It seems stronger than it's delicate appearance suggests. I use it alone or with different pendants which I had. It works nicely in both applications. Good service and prompt delivery.
1,"this sparkling little chain is great to buy. the length of the chain is just right for other sparkling little pendants. I bought my sister a necklace with a star-shaped sparkling pendant. the chain doesn't really go with it. So i bought this twisted 20'' chain, it fits perfectly. people praise it a lot. it makes the pendant looks much better.we were worried that this kind of twisted chain would be easy to break. but in fact, it holds very well. good quality!"
1,"This ring is simply beautiful - elegant, simple, and classy, and I'm very happy with my purchase. Not gaudy or overstated in the least, color is beautiful and quite neutral - can wear this with anything! Value for the money is fantastic! Standard shipping was actually very fast - got mine in two days (shipped from CA to DE - not bad at all). I'll definitely order from Peora again!"
1,"I really enjoy wearing this ring. I find myself looking at the stone throughout the day because it seems like it looks dark, then it looks lighter. It is very comfortable, solid and I especially like the setting. It is an elegant ring yet simple enough to wear every day."
1,"Very nice travel size. Recipient loves it and says she'll use it for everyday as well. Roomy and will hold a lot of jewelry. Good quality, pretty fabric."
1,"The quality of these earrings is amazing! The crystals sparkle with beautiful colors, and the sterling silver is very nice. Service was very prompt. My package arrived in 3 days. Great service. Thanks!!!!!!!"
0,"I agree with the review about the coating, my earrings actually had the coating on the front side so unless I wear them backwards people will only see the coating and not really the rare color swarovsky crystal. Also, that rare color is really hard to coordinate with many outfits. It goes with silver and light gray, that's it. However, I have really loved all the other earrings I've order from Gem Avenue."
1,"If you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention, this is it! I have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when I wear these (earrings and pendant) than I have from all the Swarovski jewelry I have created and worn. This is a very different color than I have ever worked with; it appears as if two sides only are 2x AB and the other two aren't - quite unusual which makes it fun."
1,Earrings are truly beautiful. Product is much more than I expected. Lots of sparkle and dance but in marvelous taste.
0,I received these earrings yesterday and was very disappointed. The colors are so faded out that it is hard to tell what colors they are supposed to be. The pictured item in no way portays the true item and so my best advice to you would be to pass on this one.
1,"For my wife, I purchased this rosewood ring case. Little did I know that it would readily become a favorite of hers to contain and showcase her rings. The external portion of the case is rosewood and the case is hinged in such a manner so that the lid separates from the base; thus, allowing the base to become a showcase, of sorts, for the rings contained therein. The ring holders permit adequate support of the rings to hold them in place and showcase them to their fullest extent. For travel, the cover and lid interlock well and keep the contents safe and secure. The case is a fitting complement to any and all rings, no matter how expensive the latter may be. It is a very good purchase for the money and a reliable container for one's precious jewelry."
1,The ring is small but tasteful.Has a great fit and sure to draw attention. The quartz stone is really pretty and nice detail. Very happy with the purchase.
1,This item is very pretty. I bought it as a gift for a music teacher I know and she loved it.
1,"This belly ring is just the perfect size for those who want to show off their flat stomach yet not be accused of flaunting it. With just enough bling, you'll love this eye-catching sparkler and will want to keep it in forever."
1,I bought it for my granddaughter. She was absolutely mesmerized by it.
1,"I lovelovelove this necklace!! ...however the string knots have come undone a couple of times, it's nothing that a boy scout can't fix. =]"
1,I ordered this ring and received it in a very timely manner. It was just as pretty when I got it. I'd ordered a size 9 and it was a tad snug but that may be because I have big fingers. But it is a beautiful ring and nicely priced!
0,"The hilt is beautiful and well done but the sword itself is soft pewter and bends so easily I'm afraid it will break off. I was hoping for a necklace that I could wear all the time, but this one is so soft I don't dare sleep in it. It is very fragile."
1,Arrived very promptly and was much nicer than what was shown on the website. Will order from this vendor again!
1,"I purchased this for my wife for Christmas. She is a big bracelet lover and has a number of diamond tennis bracelets of this carat weight along with a number of other gemstone bracelets. She really loves this one. Hasn't taken it off since she got it and all her friends, sisters, and other relatives were going crazy over it. I did good. Guys I know you'll know what I mean. Nice gift! For the pragmatic reading this, we just had it appraised to put it on our insurance and it appraised at over $2,000. The jewelry store appraiser told her that she got a great deal. Katarina did a great job shipping it and it was here in a couple of days. I would buy from them again in a heart beat."
0,"Though the upper part of the Ouroboros face was messed up to a visible point (being the only upsetting part because it cheapened it), overall, the general detail of the pendant was alright. It surprised me that the size of the pendant was that of a quarter (take or add), which I actually liked, because I couldn't imagine wearing a huge thing. Delivery was very quick and the packaging was professionally done."
1,"This was a great find. The wedding colors were Black and Pink. I couldn't find pink jewelry anywhere and then I found these-they were perfect. I have worn them many times since and always get complements. I would have preferred a closing clasp as I worry this will pull thru, so far it has not released itself. There is a nice mix of tones that really accents the piece."
1,"Because of a change in mind, I had to return my item. But the customer service I received in doing so was outstanding.I would definitely buy again from this vendor."
1,I love this ring and wear it all the time. My friend bought one after seeing mine... the cost was great... I've had the ring for about 5 years... and its in great shape...its an old friends now. No discolor. I love it and am still jumping for joy all these years later.
1,"This is a beutiful ring. Its a bit thick and wide so seems a bit smaller than the other size 6 rings I have. I wear this ring only in winters. In summers, my fingers swell a bit :)"
0,Very pretty. A little tight; will need an extender. Still worth the money and looks great on either ankle. Will consider buying from again in the future.
1,"this one is just spectacular, I love this bracelet"
0,"i was expecting something of higher quality. i ordered this because it looks exactly like a piece i used to have, but this ring was poorly made; the hinges are not even, which doesn't allow the ring to bend properly. i don't know what material it's made of, but it is *not* pewter. it is far too fragile."
1,"Dans Jewelry in general, and this piece in particular; are both amazing. Great price, fast service, AND an extremely impressive piece. Well made, attractive, and truly iconic. I've recieved many, many compliments since buying this ring. Thanks for the great work, Dan!"
1,This ring was purchase for my son's 16th birthday and when it arrived I was amazed at the craftsmanship. It is beautiful but just right for a young man. The price was great and shipping was quick! I will buy again from them. My son loves it and wears it everyday!!
1,"Excellent quality sterling silver, and though I was worried, sizing was right on! This was important to me because I was trying to decide between this sterling silver ring and a tungsten ring, and apparently some tungsten rings on Amazon run a half size larger than normal. My boyfriend was very pleased. My only complaint is I wished it had come in a 'felt' ring box, but that wasn't too big of a deal considering it's on my boyfriend's finger anyway."
1,"I bought this ring for my seventeen year old daughter who lovespewter. She loved it, as do I. It is very well made and well worththe money."
1,"This highly polished sterling silver ring is as practicalas it is attractive. The unique design, besides being eyecatching,is comfortable on the finger and flexible enoughto adjust slightly for just the right fit. Wear it on onefinger today, on another next time. It is priced well andcomes in a lovely little colorful but tasteful ring box, as do all this merchants rings."
1,This is a great ring and it is very flexiable in sizing!! Very cute and great for the price!!
1,"Excellent service, and the ring is beautiful and reasonably priced. I'd definitely order again."
1,"I'd wanted this ring for at least a year, and I finally got it as a present from my Amazon gift list. It's so cute! The only small difference from the picture is that instead of the ends being round, they are more teardrop shaped. I got it in a size 4 for a pinky ring. I can tell it will be one of my frequently worn rings. :)"
1,"Really like this ring...it fits well (you always hope the size that you know you are is the same size the company makes), it's a unique design and furthermore it's a sturdy ring!!! Sometimes when you buy spiral rings, it's easily misshapen, but I have had this ring for going on a couple of weeks and it has not lost it's shape at all."
0,The toe ring was bigger than your normal toe rings. But it was very nice.
1,"This is good quality craftsmanship. I use mine as my handheld computer stylus. I store it reversed on my little finger, and wear it on my index finger as a stylus. It is easy to use and accurate, I can do graffiti ( palm input ) and sign my name with it easily. The tip is just the right distance from the finger to position as if I am holding a normal pen. This is much more convenient than a traditional stylus."
0,"I love Titanium. I think its one of the best materials out there. Its as strong as steel, yet half the weight. I have titanium watches, bracelets, chains, and rings. Compared to those items this just seems, ehh...Finish is dull, caps will come unscrewed if you dont tighten them has much as possible (and check periodically for changes), and the size doesnt accomidate as many keys as I thought it would. I only have 8 keys on it but with the caps (approx. 1/4"" long each) it seems a little cramped. It's feasible and I only paid $14.40 because of ""Friday Sale"" so I probably wont return it."
0,"Quick shipment, but picture is deceptive. Ruby color is highly variable, diamond accent point is an invisible chip, and gift note amateurly done."
1,"This thing was awesome while it lasted, however 11 months into owning the knot that held the eye started giving me trouble. however i did wear almost everyday, so im not suprised. but the eye is still in great shape and im still happy over that"
1,"I wear it everyday and I like it a lot. The questions I get from people as to its meaning give me some wiggle room, and I can adjust what I say depending upon their religious domination."
1,"I love this necklace! very well crafted & pretty :) its smaller than i thought it was (3cm) Safer than a inverse cross, since no one will understand what it means. Good cause i live in a religious town."
1,"The bracelet arrived amazingly fast considering that I chose standard shipping and live overseas, in fact it was 10-20 days early. Soa) that is a compliment to the delivery speed.b) the actual appearance matches the photo very wellc) it's surprisingly light and easy to adjust; overall I'm very pleased with the design.After wearing it for only a few days, a crack appeared in the bracelet just right of the phoenix's wing and it became nearly unadjustable; the next day, it broke. Whether it was out of a material flaw or my mishandling (I suspect I adjusted it too much, it should be adjusted once and left so if possible) I can't guess.Luckily, the company (Dan's Jewelers) was unbelievably helpful when I emailed them and sent me a replacement at their expense the very next day. I can't describe how much pleasantly suprised I was; once again thanks for the excellent and fast customer support. When I search for something in the future, I know whose products I will look for first...Right now, the bracelet looks and does just fine; I have taken care to adjust it only once or twice and didn't have any problems. I've already gotten several compliments about it and am very happy with the entire purchase."
1,"It's a nice bracelet that is very affordable. I've gotten many compliments. When people ask where I got it, I tell them."
1,"Thank you for your prompt efficient service.The bangle was a present for my daughter-in-law (who is also my best friend). Baby Elijah was born very prematurely in 2006 and sadly lived only 11 days - since then we have come through terrible grief and then great elation with the unexpected birth of Lexie. Elijah will always be in our hearts, with the Phoenix representing our monumental rise from the ashes of despair - my daugher-in-law LOVES the bangle! Thank you."
0,"Like any stainless steel product that I have purchased, they all seem to scratch very easily. Just from wearing it one day, if I am at a computer and setting my wrists down on the desk, it will scratch it. Very disapointed in stainless steel in general."
0,"I wasn't very happy with this purchase. It looked a little dingy and not as shiny as it did online. My husband seems to like it and wears it everyday. So, I guess that's all that matters."
1,"i always wanted a titanium braclet.and i found this on of all places amazon.com..i thought why not? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person! very high quality...the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy..it does not look gawdy or""bling bling ""tacky..... treat yourself and pick this one up!"
1,I have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years. Never found the right style/size/design combination to fit until now. This bracelet looks great on the wrist. It is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching; I'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation.
1,"Wearing it from the day i brought it. Over 2 months now. Very happy with this one. Very light, almost like plastic. Looks very stylish! I like it."
0,"This cross was very cute. I took one star away because it was much smaller than it looked (I couldn't find any measurements). And the other because I was a bit disappointed in the value. So if you're aware of the size and price and in love with it anyway, maybe it's for you."
0,It's a nice pendant if it was white gold it would have been even better. Its not really something you want around your neck. It's very large. It was really cheap though.
1,"heavy, strong and it looks just good.. i would get other products like this one.. it has a black shade which makes it looks vintage."
0,"I was really excited to get these earrings in. But disappointed when I opened the package. The shape was similar, but earring hook was much different. The tail of the hook was longer than the front so it would hang lower and looked strange.I was hoping it had just been a mix up, and I would get the right one sent to me, but now I'm returning them and hoping Gem Avenue will make sure they properly display the product they will be sending you.** Don't think this review is all bad though. I also ordered the Irish Claddagh ring for a friend for her birthday and it was perfect. As well as a necklace for a pendant for myself and so far it has held up really well. ** I'll be ordering again, I will just be more leery about the pictures matching and such."
1,"My new earring jackets are lovely! The box and presentation were very nice, but the diamonds in the jackets are very bright and beautiful."
1,"I purchased these and found them to be of a very high quality. Ny wife is a ruby girl, and it is her birthstone, and many briolettes these days are not of this grade. Beautifully cut, and a deep blood reddish pink. Seller was so helpful, customer service excellent. Would recommend."
0,"My wife likes these earrings very much. That said, the picture depicts a much more vibrant shade of red than you will observe in person unless you're in direct sunlight."
1,"Looks great, feels great. I would definately reccomend it to anyone. The string it comes on is really small though."
1,"I bought this thinking I would get some open-back kind of nice pendant that really showed its price. Much to my pleasure, it turned out to be beautiful solid piece that is both heavier and larger than I had anticipated (both are good things)! Those of you looking at this item's picture thinking it won't look as good, you're right; it will look better. Not to mention the nice bag and cord it comes with. Honestly I had planned to put it on a chain, but I personally think the cord looks better! Overall I'm very pleased and would highly recommend this piece to anyone."
1,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is nicely detailed, hefty to wear, and that the seller (Dan's Jewelers) was extremely responsive. I actually got this in one day. I'm very happy with the medallion."
1,"Received this piece very quickly. As others have stated the picture does not do it justice. Just a beautiful piece and the mythology behind it makes it all the more special since it incorporates Mjollnir and Jormungander.Highly recommend it, actually will be buying another for my son."
0,"I bought these because I love anything rose gold. I figured I was taking a chance given that it was rose gold over sterling silver, and I was right. After a single wear, the rose gold wore off IN MY EARS, leaving my earring holes red and irritated. I couldn't wear earrings for a few days after wearing these because my ears were infected due to the gold wearing off the posts into my ears. The earrings are now an icky dark silvery/black color along the posts/bottom of earring. If you have sensitive ears, steer clear of these."
0,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday 3 and a half years ago and it arrived fine. People were impressed at seeing this ring, it looks pretty awesome and a little intimidating I guess for people who aren't use to seeing them worn. Within the first year the bolts started coming loose, so I brought it to my jewelry teacher back when I was still in high school and he put new bolts in and it fit much better! More snug and moveable. It's worth a buy but don't expect it to last forever if you wear it often, you should get new bolts put in place when they get loose.But I can't buy any more of this from Dan's jewelry, as it says it won't ship here, I don't know why as I bought two finger length rings from here before.Oh since I bought it for my boyfriend the ring fits fine but if you're a woman, it might be big to wear-it was a tiny bit loose on him, I'm not sure what size he wears. Also the picture looks bright but the metal is much darker than the picture, but still nice looking."
1,"I bought this ring for my wife as a gift. She loves it! The quality is excellent, and the three rings fit very nicely on her finger."
1,Bought the ring as a gift. Like it so much that I am going to get me one.
1,"I like the ring a lot. I had another one similar to it and it broke, this was a great replacement and I seriously doubt I will have any problems with this well made, great fitting ring. I have gotten plenty of comments."
1,This item is a beautiful piece. Great value and a true pleasure doing business with the company. I Highly recommend them and will definately do business with them again
1,A gift to my wife who likes frog items. She was impressed and wears in all the time. Well crafted and sturdy and looks good too.
1,I really enjoy shopping at this site. My order did not take long to arrive and I really love the convenience shopping at this site. I love my frog!!!!
1,"I first saw this necklace in Macy's for a lot more money, so I bought it on Amazon. It is absolutely beautiful! If you like it in the picture, you'll love it even more in person! I didn't pay tax or shipping and it arrived very quickly. The only drawback is the chain is so tiny and delicate, it has to be replaced with a thicker rose gold or white gold chain."
0,"As everyone said, the pendant is nice, and cute. Was a great hit with the wife but the chain (even with all the comments) was even thinner than expected. I kept looking at the hue of the rose gold and don't think it has the right ""rose gold"" hue. Looked more like normal gold not as yellow but still just gold and not as rosy as the picture. That is why I took out 1 star for the chain and the second star for the color. But it is a nice piece. It is buyers be wary as opposed to beware."
1,"I bought this for my wife's birthday. We have always had cats (currently have 8, all indoor) so it was appropriate. It's really a nice piece of jewelry, even though I know nothing about jewelry. It's smaller than I thought it would be and the chain is really really delicate; too small if fact for my wife's taste. But she really likes the piece. Hey, that's all that matters to me. I done good."
1,"THis piece is magnificent. It is a fabulour gift for a true cat lover. Unlike other pieces i looked at that really only should be worn by a child, this piece is sophisticated and elegant with the silouette and the diamonds. Then only draw back is the chain is really too delicate for everyday wear. I gave this as a gift to my manager and she loves it. She wears the piece everyday."
1,I bought this for my daughter's 22nd birthday. It is absolutely adorable and well worth the price!!
0,"this item picture showed that the item is silver and shiny and when i received it, it was a dark silver, still a good buy for the price, but if your wanting something shiny bright and noticeable this isnt it, still served my purpose for a christmas gift, and the person receiving it liked it, so overall a good cheap buy."
1,"My husband liked the ring and he is very picky. The ring we received didn't have any sharp edges like some of the other buyers claimed, however, it does run a bit big."
1,I am happy that I got the comfort fit. It is strong and was a great price. I lost so much weight I needed something to wear so people would know I was married. I could not wear my wedding band any more for it was to big this has done a great job.
1,its a very nice ring you cant go wrong for the money cheap but could easy cost you 30 dollars in a store
1,"got it to us within 4 days or so. quality of the ring is good... overall, just a great purchase at a good price."
1,I have been looking for these earings. And i love them. Looks like good quality sterling silver. and will be ordering again soon.
1,"I ordered these in late December 2008. They were shipped quickly and arrived in great condition with a small, velvety pouch for storage. The price is difficult to beat. The silver is highly polished, so I hope it holds up. They still look great three months from purchase, and I wear them at least once a week. They've worked well for both dressy occasions and more casual wear, and have earned several compliments from coworkers and students. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for inexpensive silver jewelry that doesn't look or feel inexpensive."
1,I'm very pleased with this pendant.Used it for a necklace for a while thenhung it on my rearview mirror.
1,I purchased this as a gift and had it engraved. It is a beautiful piece. Very happy with the quality & price.
1,I bought the 'C' necklace and I am pleased with it. It is light and comfortable to wear. It fits perfectly around my neck. I wouldn't recommend this necklace for children because of its delicate beads. The company also sent me a free necklace as a gift. :->
1,Very unique but makes you look elegant when worn. It is a lot smaller in close up compared to the actual image
1,I love wide bracelets that stand out and become a conversation piece and this one does!
1,"Girlfriend loved it! Everyone asked where she got it! Certainly an excellent deal, and just as described!"
1,"This bracelet was exactly what I had in mind for a particular dress. It seems that buying a copper bracelet other than the ones which have health claims, isn't all that easy. The price was perfect for my needs."
1,I bought this bracelet for my nine yr old daughter and she loves it! The metal cuff is just as it appears in the photo. Good quality. I would like to have one of my own.
0,"The ring is pretty, but the stone fell out within two weeks. I only wore it a few times. I definitely do not recommend it."
0,It did not take long for the jade pieces come out of the silver holders. The jade did not appear to be of good quality either. I am disappointed and hesitant to purchase jewellery online again.
1,I am very happy with this product. It looks great on my bombei chest and holds all my bracelets (which there are many of). I would recommend this to anyone looking to organize and display their jewelry.
0,Nothing fancy. This product is pretty affordable and my jewelry (bracelets) look pretty neat in this organizer. I've gotten a good use out of this item. I like it
1,I love my new bracelet holder. No more mess on the dresser. They are organized and it looks wonderful! Highly recommend!
0,"The bracelet stands looks great with all of my bracelets displayed. However, when it comes time to add or remove a bracelet, it is very difficult to open and close the clasps that hold the rods. When I first got the stand, I thought I was going to break it because I had to pull so hard to open the clasps."
1,Simple and elegant. The milgrain edge adds a touch of sophistication and the half round band gives the ring more interest compared to flat milgrain bands. It's also wears very comfortably on the finger. The price is great for a 14K gold band. Only wished it had more size and material(like 18K or platinum) options. But overall a great classic wedding band.
0,"I thought this ring was very nice , but I was sent the wrong size & had to return it. They did refund my money in a timely manner though."
0,These earrings look just like you bought them at the dollar store...or even worse! I can't even impagine paying full price.
0,"Unfortunately, these look much cuter online than in real life. The design is wonderful, but the quality is definitely cheap, with the ""stones"" appearing plastic."
0,"The gold band is a little thin, but the pearls and diamonds are of good quality. The diamond accents, surprisingly, were ""eye-clear"" and very bright. Overall pleased, just wish the band was a little wider. This product is okay if you are needing a secondary accent piece, but a little lightweight for everyday wear. Would recommend."
0,"These boxes did not meet my expectations. And they are smaller than I expected. I will not use them for gifts as they do not look good enough. I will put my own jewelry in them for storage. They were not expensive, but they also were not particularly good value. Would not recommend if you are looking for a replacement for the boxes that jewelry comes in. These look cheaper, not better, than the usual Amazon packaging."
1,"I got this necklace as a gift and I love it!!! The color is stunning and the size is perfect; not to small, not to big. Have gotten tons of complements on it."
0,"I love this ring for sentimental more than luxurious reasons. You get what you pay for - the ring is solid, but does not shine as in the pictures, nor is it possible to clean it enough to get it to look as smooth and reflective as in the photos. An arm's length look at the ring shows noticeable marks on the metal; seems like small scuffs that simply don't come off. Very disappointed in that, but I can't argue too much considering the price. Good value, but don't expect the finest quality.All that said, because it is the ring that was placed on my hand when my beloved and I were married, I will always treasure it. Sentimentality can imbue value in anything."
1,".I love chrome diopside because it is the clearest green you'll ever see; it works as a substitute for Emeralds. The smaller earrings are perfect for my little friends one of whom was born with a unformed ear and has had to have a lot of plastic surgery.If you have small ears, or a little friends that you adore,these are a wonderful gift and at a really good price for 14kt and this absolutely magnificent stone! The setting is like so many of the earrings I gave to my little friends for Christmas. I hope my little friend can wear these; her sister will have no problem and she is a May girl (Emerals birthstone).Enjoy these gorgeous round shaped, locking earrings. They are stunning.Victoria Tarrani"
1,Perfect gift for my 13 year old daughter. Looks great with her rope chain. Can't beat the price and quality.
1,The piece came 1 day earlier than expected and I am extremely pleased with the piece. The quality and size is excellent and was made in Italy it doesn't get any better than that. Even the packaging was impressive. Well worth the $46.00 I highly recommend this piece of jewelry.
0,"These jackets are not good quality...I purchased these & I returned them the next day, they have a yellow tint to them & the clarity of these diamonds are very poor...Pay a little more & you can get a better pair, read my other review on the pair that I bought & kept...Sometimes its worth it to go the extra mile, especially when it comes to buying diamonds...You get what you pay for!!!"
1,I bought this beautiful jewelry box as a gift for a friend and she loved it. The craftmanship is excellent & the materials used are of high quality. This was an excellent value at $20.
1,Me and my husband both have this ring and we love them. They're so shiny and so comfortable you don't even notice them on your finger.
1,Very comfortable. Best value 14K white gold band that I could find after extensively searching department stores & the web.
1,"I like the charm, it's really cute. I've had it for several months with no problems."
0,"what a pleasant little turquoise surprise in this solid bracelet! It wears well, and looks good on. I like it and recommend its' purchase."
0,This bargain bracelet works well with casual or semi casual wear...it's snug and virtually 'weightless'...easy to travel with and adds a bit of pizazz to a any solid colored blouse or sweater.
1,"5 stars because it is as advertised and is a terrific value.My wife is very happy with this and I do believe this is the best price you can get for these quality diamonds in this style pendant. However, I wish I could have afforded one step up (in the same size), the quality of the diamonds really aren't that great. Most probably wouldn't notice the difference, but if I had stepped up to a G color and SI clarity I'm sure we'd get more sparkle. These seem a little flat. Perhaps the cut quality isn't quite as good as others.From what I've seen, that one step up doubles the price however. So this was a good buy, just wish I could afford more (who doesn't)."
1,"Great for the price and bling! You get a lot of sparkle from the ""gems"" and the band size and size of the CZs are perfect."
1,"very nice standard hoop earrings, not too small, not too bigh, just fine. The rose color gives it a special chiqueVery prompt shipment."
0,"I could not find a size in the description of these earrings. For the price, I figured they would be an inch or less. They are very thin and over an inch, almost two. I do not care for them, but for the price, will suffice. I only have one rose gold necklace to wear them with."
0,"Liked the style and customer service, but disappointed in the small size."
1,It is an excellent item. The price is very reasonable. A recommanded gift for friendship.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my boss, and she was extremely pleased. It is much prettier in reality than in the pictures. Nice velvet interior. All in all, it's very elegant and classy."
1,The first jewelry box had a scratch on the lid. Amazon replaced it quickly. The jewelry box was given as a gift and the recipient likes it very much.
1,The Canadian nickel tie tack is nicely made and ver unique. My orser was processed really quickly and was packed very well so that case and tie tack were well protected. I would certainly purchase from the vendor again in the future.
1,"These silver Claddagh earrings are very pretty, and very comfortable to wear--they are easy to keep shined, and I even forget I have them on, they are so light."
1,"Just received this ring this week. Quality is outstanding, fit and finish very fine, every detail excellent. was thrilled with the price , delivery and quality of my ring. Sabrina jewelers did a wonderful job. thanks go to them. ohhhh yes, very nice unique design, already getting compliments."
0,"The chocker appears to be absolutely beautiful in the picture, but when it arrived it was very cheap looking. There was glue all around the jewel. I realize that the price is great but not the quality. I would not recommend this to anyone because I really believe they would be disappointed."
1,"im a girl and i got this for my birthday and i loved it! i wear it non stop and get compliments on it all the time, the only flaw would be that its edges are sharp, but it isnt really a problem."
1,I purchased this for my nephew's Bar Mitzvah. He is an Israeli young man (now) who doesn't especially like jewelry. His Bar Mitzvah was yesterday & my sister just informed me that he really loves it.
1,"I cannot give a seller feedback yet as that is the msg I am receiving from the Amazon feedback page, however, the Star is awesome quality for the price. I would order from Silver Insanity again in a New York minute!"
1,"Overall, I like this very much. It is a good size and made very well. My only problem is that a couple of the points on it are a bit sharp and I worry that I'll get stabbed by them sometime. I am not sure how it would be fixed considering the size and the fact that I think it would look bad if the points were blunt. I would rate it 4.5 if that were an option."
1,"Fabulous! I am extremely satisfied and will purchase another egg from Masterpiece Jewels. I had accidently doubled ordered and a representative from Masterpiece Jewels called my to verify my order. He was extremely professional and kind, with personal service that you do not see much anymore. I purchase one of these every year for my anniversary and I will order from Masterpiece again. THe Fabrege egg was absoutely beautiful! Thank You again!"
1,"I first came across the Silver Insanity line of Celtic jewelry last year, when I was looking for Christmas presents. Jackpot! I confess I spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items, both on Amazon and on the Silver Insanity website. The teardrop earrings I picked out were quite a success, so much so that I recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver Celtic knot earrings for myself. I've been very happy with my selection, and I just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend. I highly recommend the items from Silver Insanity, and plan to order from them again."
1,"I originally wanted to purchase another pair of Celtic earrings, but Hollyinformed me a few hours later the pair I chose was out of stock. She immediately refunded my money. As soon as I found out the pair I had chosen was not available, I chose these as a second choice. They are very pretty. Just as described. Elegant. Simple. But not cheap looking.Well worth the price. They were packaged in a little zip lock bag andtucked inside a little velvet like pouch. Fine packaging for me. Theywere shipped securely and quickly. I am sure my daughter is going tolove them. I would definately purchase from Silver Insanity again.Excellent customer service. Excellent communications."
1,"I got these for my wife for her birthday, and she absolutely loves them. They have this lovely curve to them, and the overall effect is somewhat viola-like. They seem to have a nice heft, and are just the right size. Big thumbs up!"
1,I bought these earrings for a gift. They arrived in just a couple of days. The quality is very good - a good weight silver and the detail is well done. I would not hesitate to order from them again.
1,"These earrings are great value for money. Solid and have stayed shiny silver since I bought them, no tarnishing. They are now my favourite earrings"
1,"Beautiful and well crafted design it is very thin but not as frail as you think. I purchased this necklace with a pendant and it matched up perfectly,but I'm a pretty stout guy and it just didn't fit. It was my error,but I do not regret buying it at all.So here's the summary beautiful necklace, your getting more than you pay for,just not the necklace for us larger guys."
1,"This is the first time I have ordered jewelry from Amazon and really didn't know what to expect. I was plesantly surprised , this necklace is of good quality for the price. It looks great with any shade of blue from sweaters to blue jeans . I'd recommend it!"
0,buying rings online is just hard. It's either too loose or too tight and you end up wearing on another finger.
1,The piercing looked exactly like the pictureIts so pretty I can't stop looking at it!!I highly recommend thisYou wont regret it!
1,"I bought this necklace so I could switch my pendants around. I like the 20"" length. I love it. I get a lot of compliments on the necklace itself! I would highly recommend this chain necklace."
0,"The necklace arrived quickly, but it was kinked in a couple of spots. I'm not sure if this is typical for this type of chain and I was able to carefully remove the kinks, but I was a bit disappointed. On the other hand my wife seemed happy (it was a present for her) and didn't seem to notice where I removed the kinks."
1,received it very quickly and was very pleased. It was the perfect size and so sparkly.
1,"I tend to (not always, but mostly) review products I like, and this one is no exception. I wear this chain all the time (even when running on the treadmill), only having taken it off a handful of times in the last few months, and it's just lovely. Shiny, strong (resists a toddler's tugs and yanks), and most importantly, it does not get tangled in or pull out my hair!! I can't imagine any silver pendant it would not pair nicely with, and I only wish I had another one in 16"" to vary where my pendant sits on my chest. It was shipped in a timely fashion, arrived in excellent condition, and I am very happy with it."
1,I wanted to get a Hamsa necklace for my BF and it was really tough to find one that was more on the manly side. I saw that someone else had written a review for this necklace; that it was a gift for her BF and he loved it. That was the confirmation I needed!I ordered the necklace and when I received it I was more impressed than I thought I would be! The chain was perfect (kinda like a box chain) and the detail looked great! My BF loved it and he wears it everyday!
0,"A lovely design, this ends up being a very bulky ring. It comes up a full centimeter from my finger. Despite this, it is comfortable. The silver has a hard finish which ends up looking a lot like stainless steel."
1,"This ring is beautiful!!! It has more fire and sparkle than most diamonds. Shipping was fast. I received it much quicker then I expected. It also, came with a very pretty jewelry box. I will use this seller again."
1,"The coloration is more gray and white, than black and white. Looks good for styling with solid colors, especially red, black, white, gray, yellow/mustard tones."
0,"Pendant came quickly and safely. Liked the pendant, but small for my taste. I like large pendants, but it is well made."
0,"Not great, but ok. Some reviewers said it works on silver, but it really doesn't. The image also doesn't show that it's for gold and precious stones only."
1,"I love the price of this jewelery cleaner and I love that it's available for prime! It works great, even on my cz jewelry!The basket feature with the brush is nice, too - I have various-sized nose studs that I use my cleaner for, too. One of my smaller ones slipped through the basket but I was able to get it out of the bottom of the container easily with a pair of tweezers.Great price, great product and ease of use - I'm giving it 5 stars!!"
0,"Container was cracked and leaking upon arrival. I had to throw it out. Thank goodness it was in a separate plastic bag so my other purchases were not soaked. Not worth cost to return, so my loss."
1,This is definitely one of the better vendors. A+ shopping experience; top quality product. I would recommend them without reservation.
1,I had to clean my class ring. This product really did bring out the sparkle in the diamonds and brighten the gold!
1,"I tested it out as soon as I opened the box. My ring looks like new again, the sparkle is unbelievable. I would strongly recommend getting this. Very pleased."
1,I love this product. I use it for my engagement and wedding rings to make them sparkle again. Makes a huge difference and they look as good as new.
1,This cleaner works really well for everyday cleaning of jewelry. I've been using it for years and was excited to find it on Amazon.
1,"this is a good product, this is a good price, I recommend this stuff for do it yourself at home jewelry cleaning!"
1,"I was excited to receive my jewelry cleaner and it works just as it says it would. I used it on my diamonds, gold, and wedding band and they are shiny again just like on the day I first got them. So excited I will be using this item often."
1,It is very easy to use and my jewlery comes out clean and sparkling. Definitely worth the price. It is nice knowing that before traveling or special events I can clean my jewlery at home instead of having to take it to a jewlers.
1,If you have diamond jewerly you need this product. It works great. I use it once or twice a week to shine up my diamond ring.
1,I have used Connoisseurs Jewlery Cleaner for many years. My jeweler sells it in her shop and highly recommended so naturally if they recommend I know it is great since we do trust her. But to have great looking jewelry you must remember to clean it often and follow directions.
1,"This is by far the best at-home jewelry cleaner, at a great cost. Nothing compares to the expensive sonic machines that jewelry stores have, but this is pretty impressive. I use it on my engagement ring regularly and am very pleased with it. Definitely recommended!"
0,"I thought I would purchase this thinking it would be like having it cleaned from a professional....wrong! Liquid soap, warm water using a child's toothbrush does so much better (what I normally use). The solution actually made my diamond cloudy. I had to reclean with my normal method to get it sparkly again."
0,"Works pretty well on already decently clean silver. I tried to clean a REALLY old, tarnished sterling ring with this, but it didn't do anything. The ring may be ruined, I'm not sure, but it doesn't seem to be good for deep cleaning or making that old piece of jewelry look new again. May be better to get an old fashioned silver cloth."
1,"I ordered this claddagh ring for my boyfriend as a graduation present, and it came in today. (Exactly a week after I ordered it, 2 days before the estimated arrival.) It is absolutely gorgeous! The packaging it came in is perfect for giving it in as a gift. It is the perfect size for a man to wear. I'm afraid it might be a little small, so I'm hoping it'll be able to be resized. But it is of great quality, looks very solid and shiny. I'm very happy with it!I plan to order the smaller one for myself soon, after seeing the quality of this one. So I would definatly order from this company again."
0,I bought one of these and within the month it broke. I contacted the seller and they quickly sent me a replacement. That one lasted about 2 months. I wouldn't buy it again that's for sure.
0,"excellent quality ring.....but worst quality shipping, my package was missing 2 of the 5 items i ordered and also arrived very late.I still havent recieved my missing items after several conplaints....nor recieved any refund....its more than 1 months they havent done any thing.so if u really like it then only buy...also be prepared to lose ur money."
1,"I ordered a set of these cufflinks, as a Valentine gift for my Fiance&eacute;. He loved them!!"
1,"My expectations were blown away when I got this necklace! I expected light-weight and cheap feeling + look. Boy, was I wrong! This necklace is actually truly stunning and magnificent! The weight of it is heavier than I thought it would be, which I am happy about that. The crystals don't look like something off a plastic toy which I thought it might. It actually glistens in the light. Really beautiful! I'm more than pleased!"
0,Not exactly what I expected. The inner celtic knotwork actually is detached from the ring and spins. I found that the knotwork is poorly carved though only I would notice unless someone examined the ring closely. Nice and shiney though and very inexpensive. Would make a cheap good gift for others.
1,"This is a great ring for the price. It is smooth, low profile, perfect size ring!"
1,Don't know what I would have done without Amazon this year for my Christmas shopping. My daughter loved the ankle bracelet and it arrived right on time.
0,"Probably predictable from the price but this necklace is made of very, very thin gold and I'm worried will break without much pulling. Otherwise, it's beautiful."
1,I'm using this ring as my wedding ring. It's lightweight and fits like a dream. I love it!
1,"I brought this bracelet as a gift, however, I was so excited upon opening the box I'm keeping it for myself. It is very lovely for the price you will be very surprised at the detail and quality of the item."
0,"The look of these rings are not for everyone. I had never had a titanium ring before, and was surprised by it's light wieght - so much so that I couldn't help shake the feeling it was a plastic ring my kids would wear.An 8mm wide ring is also very big ... take a real close look at this ring before buying. I'm looking for a different one now ...I tried to increase the rating of my review (from 2 stars to 4) but apparently this is not possible.The reason for this is simply because of the great return policy Silver Insanity has - would recommend them for a ring purchase. No hassles ..."
1,I got this bracelet today. I cannot tell the difference between this one and the Tiffany's except for the price. I think any girl would like it.
1,"When I received this beautiful amethyst and sterling silver ring in the mail, I couldn't believe that this ring was as inexpensive as it was. It was about a quarter size bigger than my other size 5 rings, but I'm still wearing it. It's the most elegant of all my amethyst rings."
1,"Bought after reading all the positive feedback, and all was true! My wife enjoys simple jewelry, but this ring looks great! Good stones, solid setting, very fair value for the money.Make sure you get the sizing right the first time, otherwise you will be paying roundtrip shipping for a bigger size like I did."
1,"Ordered this ring before Christmas, it arrived on time, was beautiful, only it came in 5, 5.5, and some other size. There aren't that many sizes available. My girlfriend has small hands but chubby fingers, so it actually needed to be a size 6.5, but she manages fine with the 5.5 on her ring finger. The ring itself is really pretty and the stones are nice and sparkly. Good deal over all for the price.-KB"
1,"Great belly ring at a great price! Stays together well, and is a quality item."
0,Mine broke after two weeks - no wonder it was half off. You can buy this for a lot less from other websites as I found out later (I paid $20 supposedly on sale from $40).
1,i bought these for two little girls that have know a hard life. i wanted them to know how they can wear these and know maybe someone like them made them and they mean something more then just a choker to wear. they said they would wear them all the time and understood the meaning behind them.thanks
0,"I like small earrings and lever backs are so comfortable. I loved these till one pearl fell out. I found it and glued it in. Then I lost the other pearl. The gold, though fragile, has not bent on me. Going to find another pearl."
1,"I was very happy with this product. I use it with a medical alert tag and therefore wear it all the time. The fact that it was nickel free was necessary in this application. Also, the shipping was fast. Had the chain in about 4 days."
1,"This necklace is great, I bought it due to the fact my boyfriend would break out when wearing a standard dog tag chain. It works and feels more comfortable to him."
1,great product. just as pictured/described. i put a charm (that i already had) on it and wear it almost every day.
0,"I just got this necklace, and it just looks so different than the sample picture.The chain looks very cheap, and the end of the cross isn't straight. Looks very ugly and cheap.And I ordered my necklace as 18inches, and it came as 16.My true love waits ceremony is coming up in February 12nd, and I DO NOT WANT TO wear this necklace."
1,"This blue topaz ring is as described on the site, better than picture. Perfect for a young teenage daughter for Christmas. Shipping was quick as well."
1,Wonderful product very nice charm easy to buy no hassle with purchasing always a pleasure to purchase anything on amazon thanks
1,"The ring is exactly what I was looking for. It is small, but perfect for my pinky (the engraving part has 7mm).I just got it, but, it looks quite strong to be wear every day."
1,The ring was of great quality but I ordered the wrong thing. I wanted a pinky ring for a Gent and it was too small.
1,"You couldn't beat the price for a cute stocking stuffer, so I ordered a pair for all of my 3 daughters. They came in a nice silver cardboard box and my girls are very happy with their size and appearance."
1,"Got this for my sister and she loves them. Great detail, good size and sturdy, I would buy from this company again."
0,I received these earrings and they were too small for my ears but they are perfect for a child. I would definitely have kept these earrings for one of my girls if they were born in February.
0,"Beautiful as advertised, loved the color and cut. One flaw however, post is way too short. Lost one of them the first time I wore them. It was a love hate thing."
1,"Great product, and fast shipping. Unfortunately, I had to return them. Return process was fast and painless. Will continue being a customer. Thank you"
0,"Its a great product and I love their cause however, the jewlery fell apart after wearing it only twice."
1,I bought this ultrasonic jewelry cleaner because I was sick of going to my jewelers to get me ring cleaned every week. Well now I do not have to go any where but home to clean my rings. But this doesn't only clean rings beautifully it also cleans metal watches like you wouldn't believe. My husband has a stainless steel watch that was leaving black marks on his wrist from being so dirty. I put it in the tray for watches and then in the cleaner. To our amazement his watch came out as clean as the day I bought it for him.The only think that I noticed that is wrong with the cleaner is that when it is running there is a mist of water the will seep out but that is solved easily with a simple piece of paper towel underneath to catch the water.I have also found out that if you add a little bit of fantastic to the water your jewelry comes out even cleaner.I hope this review has helped you.
1,I am very pleased with the quality of craftsmanship--it is even prettier than it looked in the picture. Shipping was prompt as well.
1,"These pink pearls are really small, but looked very classy. They are going to be perfect for all of my bridesmaid to wear."
1,...well smooth enough for me...got it anytime on my hand .i love silver and the size so it s always with me...cool
0,This ring looks nice and shiny when you get it but after awhile it gets tarnished and it easily gets bent. It's nice for something temporary but I wouldn't recommend for long term.
1,"I think the title of this review says it all. These rings are at a great price and are good quality. My hubby ordered two, and they were delivered in individual gift boxes, but packaged in one box to save on shipping cost. Delivery was fast, and the rings look great! I got one a half-size bigger than the other, and stack them on one finger. Looks great single or stacked -- super comfortable either way.I also appreciate that this ring is available in smaller sizes. It's one of the very few rings I've been able to find online that accommodate teeny fingers.I'm a happy camper."
0,"This product was not true to its words. It was not sterling sliver, it was not stamped 925 like it should be. Turned my finger green!!!!!!"
0,"Lovely ring, but it was not sterling silver. Noticed a lack of stamp .925 on the inside when I first got it. Then after wearing a couple hours it turned my finger green. This is not sterling silver!"
1,"I like the ring. It is just as advertised by the seller. It arrived on time and fit perfectly. The ring is of good quality and sturdy, not malleable like other cheap rings I've come across. I was overall satisfied with my purchase."
1,The rings arrived in cute boxes in record time!! Just want I needed--use them as ring guards for a three stone 18k white gold ring. Great quality and nice shine. Would certainly order from this supplier again.
1,"I have a thing for rings. Especially simple silver rings. I have been looking for a ring for my right thumb for a while now. Didn't think I would ever find one big enough, but now I have. It is a beautiful silver band that fits and looks great. Couldn't be happier."
1,I bought the earrings as a gift for a Giants fan who loved them and wears them often. Exactly as described.
1,"This is what I had hoped it would be - a sweet little necklace with color and variety in design, very nice to look at, hold and wear. I just started making necklaces myself and happy to find something in recyclable materials that's aesthetic and appealing. It's a great item to collect or give as a gift, and inspiring for what I'm making on my own. I've been back to this reseller again and it looks like they feature different items at different times, possibly all within the $20-30 range. The one I got was delightful to my taste, and matched the photo."
1,"I contemplated buying this bracelet for days before i actually made my mind up and purchased it. I am hesitant of buying jewelry online in fear that it will arrive and not look anything like the pictures depict them online. First, I ordered this while I was deployed and it got to me faster than I thought it would. The bracelet look just like the advertisement said it would but better; I couldn't have been more pleased. I love this bracelet and plan to order from Nataya in the future. Gorgeous jewelry with certificate of authenticity and awesome service."
0,"I purchased these earrings for my two granddaughters (9 and 7) for Christmas. Thinking that the srew backs would make changing clothes much easier and all children earrings come with screw backs these would be perfect. They didn't have them in but a few days and the backs started coming off in their sleep, at first their mother could find the backs in bed in the morning but shortly after re-screwing the backs on almost daily one has come up missing. I have tried calling the store, emailing and going through Amazon to get to talk with these people and no one will respond. It was a big waste of money on two pair. Buyer beware!"
1,i love these earrings! i wore these for my college graduation pictures and i still get compliments on them.
0,"Before I ordered this necklace I read the reviews, so I knew the necklace would be smaller than it seemed, and I was okay with that. When the necklace arrived, I loved the setting, but the stone had a crack in it right across the middle, which was very obvious and distracting. The necklace was to be an important gift, for my daughter's high school graduation and her most expensive piece of jewelry to date. I contacted the seller about the flaw and asked if I should return the piece for a refund or for a replacement. I was assured that they would happily replace the necklace for one with a better stone. I returned the necklace to Silver Insanity, and from my perspective, that's where things started to go badly. I never received the replacement necklace. When I queried Silver Insanity, they said that delivery of the necklace had been attempted, but failed, and the necklace had been returned to them. (My husband and I were at home at the time of the attempted delivery, and don't know how we missed being aware of the delivery attempt. I also wish there had been more than one attempt before the necklace was returned to the sender.) By that point I had given my daughter a different graduation gift, and since Silver Insanity already had the necklace back in their possession, I asked to be refunded the purchase price. At this point the transaction completely fell apart. It was ONE DAY after the deadline of having Amazon help me resolve the issue, and I never heard from Silver Insanity again, nor did I ever see a refund to my credit card.UPDATE"
1,"This is a lovely piece, even prettier than the pictures showed, and I am very happy with it."
0,Anybody measured the weight of ring? I happened to do so several months later after I got it. It is 2.2 grams (size 7) instead of 4 grams as shown on the website.
1,"I'm happy with my delicate silver earrings. I was looking for small sterling hoops to put-in & forget-about for the Summer & these will work just fine.Now, that said, it's very difficult to judge tiny items online. (I ordered them with my fingers-crossed.) So - for the lack of a photo of the hoops on a model's ear - I'll try to share the kind of info I was wishing for before I ordered.The size is just a tad over half-inch (1/2"") & when I have them on, they clear my earlobe by a about an eighth-inch (1/8""). They are thinner than I expected, but not flimsy. The entire hoop slides thru my pierced opening, which is small for some posts.The finish is very smooth & highly polished.As others stated, endless hoops are a challenge to close, but this small size can be especially troublesome. I used a 5X mirror & the first one took me almost 15 minutes to close... 2nd hoop took 3 minutes. The good news is that the delicate hoops did not bend or loose their shape during this process, which is impressive.I felt like I got a very good value for sterling silver, even with the shipping fee. The seller sent them standard delivery for $5 & I got them in 4 days - not bad."
1,"This is such a risk when i decided to order this, because there is no picture of model wearing it. But when i received it, I just loved it! It is the one I want, not too big to make my ears look werid but the size perfect fit my ears. It is VERY hard to put it on, I strongly ask anyone who buy this dont put it on by urself. Ask a friend to help and it will be much easlier."
1,Very very happy with this product. I didn't have any trouble with the latch - but I only wear earrings like these. Wonderful quality
0,"These earrings are fine for what they are - just small hoops that won't get in the way of your daily life or sleeping habits. It took me 10 minutes of fussing trying to get them to latch in my ears before I called my husband up and he connected them in about 30 seconds, so I would recommend having someone else do it first without bothering to try struggling yourself. There was a snag on one of them, right where the latch connects, and that gets caught on things, but other than that these are well made and truly silver - I'm allergic to nickel so I would know if they weren't:) They are very comfortable to sleep in and don't bother me at any time during the day. Also if you want earrings that will just fit over your earlobes, then these are going to be bigger than you want, there is about a quarter inch under my ear. Measure 9/16ths in. before you buy so you know how big they are. Overall, an adequate purchase, they could be better, could be worse."
1,"My wife has been purchased this ring for my birthday. It's perfect in it's quality. Also, I liked it too much. It's the best ring I have."
1,"This ring is of great quality, came as promised, rhodium finish looks like white gold. I am completely satisfied with Gem Avenue, they were helpful and prompt. Definitely would purchase from them again. Ring is a knockout! He loved it!"
1,"I have alway wanted an impressive ring one that sparkles from every angle and this ring does not disappoint at all! I feel like I am really wearing a 3 karat Diamond White gold ring and it is really hard to notice the difference! I really love the gift from my wife to me! I will not tell anyone it is not a real white gold Diamond ring, This is excellent Quality I would recommend to all!"
1,"This is the best ring by far, I recieved it as a gift for my bday and I love it, I find myself looking at it all the time especially when the suns out and its sparkling...... if you have a man in your life father, brother, cousin, boyfriend,etc. get this as a gift. he'll love it... just like me."
1,i am a lover of chinese jade! this was a beautiful piece. to me jade should be done in gold not silver & this piece is one of my favorites.
1,Got this one to replace a stolen on that only had four hearts this one is less expensive but looks more expensive
1,"For our anniversary I had requested a pair of 3/4 Diamonds studs set on white gold. I hadn't cared for diamonds, but this set changed my mind profoundly. Clarity as well as cut unrivaled, perhaps next year I'll be able to get matching pendant."
0,"Very simple. It looks just like it is in the picture - that's NOT the problem. The problem is that the song is incomplete. It goes ""You are my sunshine, my only sun shine, you make me happy, when skies are grey... so don't take my sunshine away"" - it's missing ""You never know dear, how much I love you...."" I called up and they say ""It's not a mistake, that's how it's manufactured."" REALLY? If I knew that, I would have NEVER purchased it. I kept it JUST for the cosmetic value."
1,"This item was reasonably priced, in perfect condition, and shipped in a timely manner. I gave it as a gift and the recipient loved it. Great business transaction, thanks!"
1,"I don't actually know how to say a lip gloss is great, but this one was. it added shine and gloss and it was extremely smooth."
0,"The earrings themselves are quite pretty, but the backs are VERY loose (one fell off on my morning walk to work without me even touching it!). I have already lost both backs, so I am going to have to buy replacements in order to actually be able to wear these anymore."
1,Celtic sterling silver cross was just beautiful I was very pleased with this purchase. the quality was not only affordable but looking at the necklace you would think that it was more expensive than it was. I would most difinitely purchase more jewerly from SilverBin.
0,Sterling Silver Celtic Design Cross Pendant with 18 inch Cable Chain1-Star Rating. Do not buy this product. Flimsy & cheap.Stainess steel or pewter crosses are better for the money and more durable
1,I have no idea how they can do what they do at GEM AVENUE for the LOW PRICE. The ring is sleek and modern yet romantic.Looks expensive.The packaging was top notch and the delivery was the fastest of any Amazon purchase that I have made.
0,These earrings looked very nice once I received them. They were a gift for my grandmother and she loved them. Unfortunately when she wore them to an event they kept coming off. The clip just were not tight enough or something so she ended up taking them off to keep from losing them.
1,"This is a great charm, sterling silver, good detail, I made a necklace and a set of earrings from them."
0,I have always been 100% satisified with Amazon but this item was low quality and we returned it. My first bad review for a product from this nearly perfect online shopping site.Diamonds very low quality and just looked like it came out of a gum ball machine.Amazon gladly refunded money and paid to ship it back.
0,I went to buy 6 of these and was informed the company was no longer selling this item. It took me a long time to find just the right item only to have the rug pulled out from under me. Pull this ad or honor my request.
1,We ordered the bolts as graduation gifts for our son and his friends who also play on the same hockey team and used the lightning bolt for three years as their logo. Received them in less then a week and were very happy with them.
1,My husband and I bought these earrings as a Christmas gift to my grandmother. She absolutely LOVED them.
1,"I purchased this sterling silver charm for my daughter who is taking Irish dancing class and I know she'll love this now for a necklace and later on for a charm bracelet. It's a really cool charm, one any student of Irish dancing would love."
1,I love the color and sparkle of these earrings- they are petite in size but are truly beautiful! Don't hesitate.
1,"These earrings fulfill their promise and live up to their price. A nice touch is that each has a backing on the hook that prevents its slipping out. They are a pretty green and sparkle nicely --- of course, for glass."
1,"..when your show up with a couple of these beauties around your wrist. Large, highly polished chips contrast beautifully with the snowy white pearls. At a price that can't be beat for the quality, at least one of these should show up in every woman's or girl's Xmas stocking you have to fill!"
0,"I thought that this earring would be lighter. It actually makes your earlobe droop. Nice look, but too heavy."
1,I bought this for my mother and mother-in-law for mother's day. I had the front and back engraved and it looks very nice. The chain is nice as well and not one of those very fine flemsy chains. It's a little hard cutting a picture out to put in the heart but you would have that problem with any heart shape.
1,"This is a very nice locket, nice sized. About 1/2 in square space for the photos. It's really very pretty. The only trouble is printing pictures that small, but you'll have that trouble with any locket. And there's plastic to cover the pictures which makes a good template. It was a little tricky to get the plastic in and out, but worth it in the end. I recommend using an x-acto knife to cut the pictures out."
1,Beautiful silver lockets - I gave these to my teenage daughter and her friend for Valentine's Day. The best compliment I can give is that they both wear them everyday. Good quality and excellent value for the money.
1,"I purchased this locket for my girlfriend as a Valentines day present. She loved it!The chain feels and looks very good and the clasp is sturdy. The locket is small but not tiny - my girlfriend is a little over 5 feet tall and the locket was sized PERFECTLY for her. Kind of hard to get a picture in, but once I managed to get one in it looked great.I would highly recommend this locket."
0,Delivery was very fast! Overall the locket looks very nice and has a nice design. It is very easily scratched though. I wiped it with a little lens cloth and it made a scratch. Also very disappointed in the inner design. It seems almost impossible to fit a picture on the inside which is really a down side because who needs a locket when you cant even put a picture inside it. It was very hard to get a picture in there. In the end i ended up just leaving it without a picture and giving to my girlfriend for our anniversary empty! This was really disappointing! But still she liked it and wanted to keep it when I insisted that I would return it! It is a very nice piece but you were warned very hard to put in a picture!
1,"This was perfect!! I bought this for someone special and she loves it!! I liked it so much I even bought one for myself so we could both have a matching locket, it looks great on me too, and I'm a male. If your hesitant about buying this don't be, it's a great quality locket."
1,My girlfriend loves this present. She wears it all the time and it looks extremely nice on her. It was an amazing locket.
0,"Clasp broke right out of the box. Don't waste your money on this.She didn't even get a chance to wear it once, seeing as how it broke right when I picked it up."
0,"Didn't like it once I got it. Very small, had to glue the picture in. Would have returned but didn't have time (Christmas present)."
1,I bought it for my baby girl. She is 18 months old. It is too big for her now but she will be able to wear it soon. It looks like a good quality piece of jewelry. I am sure she will wear it for years.
1,This is a nice bracelet and very well made. I'm glad with the purchase and it looks super cute in my toddler's arm! I recommend!
1,My best friend is going to love this ring...it's gorgeous!
1,Jewelery was part of a Feb Bday package and the intended said she loved it. The length and style is perfect for a petite female.
1,"I actually bought this style cuff link from Touch Of Luxury, but in a square shape, which was absolutely gorgeous. I do not see the square ones on amazon anymore...maybe I got the last ones. This company has excellent customer service, they ship their items super fast and their items are beautifully gift-wrapped too. I was very impressed with their service and quality of jewelry. The cuff links were to just die for."
1,"I bought this item together with the earrings after reading some good reviews on amazon. My wife loved them both, and even now, a year later, she keeps telling me how nice they are every time she wears them. Brownie points for me :-)"
1,Love It! Just the right size and have the earrings to match! Great price! It certainly met my expectations. I know I will wear it often.
1,"although the pendant was smaller than I thought, that could definitely be from me not reading the print. anyway, it is very pretty and very detailed. I think my daughter will love it."
1,"I bought this pendant to match sterling earrings I purchased at Amazon. The pendant is very nice. Some of the reviewers were not satisfied with the chain, but I found it very satisfactory. The sterling oval on the pendant is larger than that found on the earrings. Just the right size as far as I'm concerned. You can't go wrong by purchasing this pendant and the matching earrings. They are perfect together."
1,"If you like an earthy tone Jasper, this is it! It is a nice polished piece that is very neutral. I guess that is why they lore says that it is a stone that helps keep you ""grounded"". (Groan!!) Anyway, you will like the natural color of this stone."
0,"The picture for this product makes the jade look intricately and well carved. In real life from more than 12"" away it is indistinguishable from a round hunk of jade. The cuts are so shallow they simply don't pick up enough light to even show it's been carved. Literally everyone has had to ask what it is . . ."
1,"This locket is breathtaking! It's really intricate, and feels solid as well, nothing flimsy about it. It measures 32 x 19mm and if you look at it sideways it measures almost 1.5cm at the widest. Despite its size, it has a solid weight to it. It doesn't have a flat back, it's rounded so when you have it on a chain around your neck it can flip about quite often. The front too, is rounded. However, because of its design, it means that there is ample room inside for more than just a photo. I can fit a few small gemstone chips and a very small gemstone tumblestone inside. The garnet is really genuine. It does have an open filigree design so please be careful when you have a photograph inside because if you never take off your necklace when you shower or swim (like me) you'll get it wet. There's no latch to open the locket so you need to use your nail to open it.I truly adore it. It has an old world feel to it, like an antique jewelry my grandmother passed down to me. I saw another review on another site that described this locket as gothic feminine and it describes this locket perfectly! Love it... I actually find myself working around my wardrobe to show off this necklace!As a side note, the photos on this website isn't very accurate. It is FAR more beautiful in person. Definitely get this, you won't regret it."
1,I absolutely loved the garnet locket! My birth stone is garnet and I was looking for something that had it. The vintage looking locket looks great with so many things and I love this purchase.
1,Girlfriend loved it! Thanks for the fast service too! Just in time for Christmas and was suprisingly simple to do.
1,"This ring is breath-taking and at such a great price! It looks even better than the photo and everyone who has seen it loves it! Aquamarine rings are so expensive, even for a small stone, and this stone is HUGE and beautiful and surrounded by yellow beryls and diamonds! The ring came very quickly and also was very well packed. I highly recommend this vendor!"
1,The necklace was as pictured and I received it on time. I got the matching earring as well and like them both.
1,"The description of this product is correct, the pendant is beautiful, the jade is a lovely shade of purple, and the chinese characters stand out very well on the background. I've had a lot of compliments and comments over this necklace."
1,"I had a couple of silver pendants and rings (with stones, complicated details and shapes) that were so badly tarnished that they were black. 2 minutes after starting to wipe 'em, they were totally shinny and alive, a real resurrection! No more liquid products, mess and waste of time to get jewelry looks like new anymore. Small wipes, got black on my fingers also after use, but for the price and the convenience, it's a 5 star choice."
1,"I just love it because you do not have to rinse it out, so it is perfect for silver framesIts exactly what I was looking for!"
1,"I wear a lot of silver jewelry with stones in them that can not be cleaned with regular silver jewelry cleaner. I used these wipes a few years ago and absolutely loved them! I couldn't remember the name of them, so when I finally found them, at the price they were, I had to buy them!!! They came on time and work just the way I remember. I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Works very well. I would recommend this product for silver and costume jewelry. My polished jewelry came out sparkling clean afterwards.
1,Works great - easy to use. I was able to use many different items with one cloth - a real cost savings.
1,These work great for jewelry with small places. Instant shine. I've been hunting these down for some time now. Nice product
1,"Just cleaned 4 pieces of silver jewelry with these wipes and am very happy with this purchase. Very easy to use! A friend also shined up his gold ring with one and it really cleaned it well. Highly recommend for all those rings, necklaces and bracelets you aren't wearing just because they need to be cleaned. This product will do it with minimal effort on your part."
0,"WOW! I am so impressed. I needed something for polishing a very tarnished small silver locket, and thought that buying a jar of liquid/gel polish would be overkill. These wipes turned out to be perfect. My locket was clean and shiny in less than a minute. I didn't have to deal with any mess or corrosive material. The best thing was that I didn't need to remove the photos from the fiddly little locket.I read the reviews before buying this product, so I was aware that the I would receive a smaller product than advertised. Mine was a small flat case with the 25 wipes of dimensions 2 7/8 in by 3 5/8 in (7.6 cm by 9.2 cm). Incorrect advertising is of course disappointing, but the size is perfect for my locket so I'm still giving it 5 stars.EDIT:I have modified my review to 3 stars because I'm not seeing the anti-tarnish effects claimed in the descriptions. My silver locket (with 925 stamp) lost its luster within about 4 days and became visibly tarnished after 2 weeks. I would have expected the ""anti-tarnish shield"" to be a bit better than that."
1,I bought these to clean my silver Pandora bracelet that I have been wearing for a month straight. It is shiny and new in under 10 minutes. Charms and all. This was a very simple and effective way to clean my bracelet without having to take the charms off or get them wet. No mess! I think these are just wonderful. :-)
1,"i was afraid to use it on my fine jewelry in case it would actually harm them. i tested it on a dull necklace that i got on sale and it looked brand new! super shiny and so easily too! i also shined an old silver jewelry case of mine with a wipe, and now i can see my reflection in it. eventually i gathered the courage and used it on my prized tiffany necklace and i'm so glad! it's bright, clear, and shiny again! i'd definitely recommend this product!"
1,"Perfect for what I need! Whenever I want to brighten up my jewelry, I rub them with these wipes and the rust comes right off. Easy and effective! One wipe goes a long way. I'll definitely be re-purchasing once I run out."
1,"I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of these jewelry wipes to see if they are the solution to cleaning up my Pandora bracelets so that they are clean of a days grease and grime when they return to the box which is their home. Indeed these are wonderul. They arrived after 5 days. I immediately opened them and was amazed to see that they were dry and filled with a powdered coating. It does say ""Dry"" on the bottle but that is too small to see in the picture. I tried them first on a pair of large blue topaz earrings I was wearing. They had been worn too many times without cleaning and had lost their sparkle. It returned in just a few seconds of wiping. Then for a harder challenge"
1,"Got these this weekend and used to clean a new pair of sterling silver and mother of pearl cufflinks, another set of silver cufflinks and a silver and onyx bracelet. Managed to use only one wipe to wipe all of these to a glimmering shine!"
1,"Connoisseurs Jewelry Wipes are the best product out there if you wear sterling silver jewelry. They polish it to a brilliant shine and each time, my jewelry looks brand new. These are hard to find in the stores. I am glad I found them here."
0,"A friend recommended this product. i was looking for an easier way to clean sterling than the jeweler's cloth i had been using. i don't see where this product was any better than the cloth, and it's disposable. i'll stick with my cloth."
1,"I collect old porcelain. Some pieces are 100 years old and many have gold decoration - gold patterns, gold rims, gold lettering. Although we are told that gold does not tarnish - it does. So on hundreds of my pieces (yes hundreds) the gold was dull and, on some pieces, discolored with a reddish deposit. I have never been able to find anything that would polish the gold. Then, I discovered these. Not knowing what to expect, I tried my first wipe. It took some effort and my fingers got black, but the gold, even on 100 year old pieces shines like new. On some pieces parts of the gold have been scratched away by previous owners desperate to polish it and finding it impossible. What a shame that they did not have these wipes Now I look forward to the satisfaction of using the wipes. And wait, I had a sterling silver 1939 New York World's Fair spoon that was dark gray and black with tarnish. For years and years I had tried polishing it with Goddard's Silver paste polish. No help. Just out of idle curiosity, I tried one of the wipes. With almost no effort or pressure the spoon is now as bright and shiny as new.The only negative is that Connoisseurs has reduced the size of the wipes from 2.7 inches x 5 inches to 2 7/8 inches x 3 5/8 inches and has changed the packaging from a convenient pull out one wipe at a time container to a flat pull them apart container."
1,"The best thing I've found for quickly and easily cleaning and polishing my silver jewelry, and small...I keep a sheet in my suitcase all the time."
1,"I have tried other type jewelry cloths, but these work more quickly and easily and leave silver jewelry sparkling. Note, It is good to rinse off your jewelry after you have cleaned it with the cloth to remove the &#34;tarnish&#34; from the item. I especially like these easy to use cloths for quick clean up on rings to make them sparkle. I have also used them to clean my watch face and band and various broaches and pins, hair barrettes, and nick nacks. Most of my jewelry is silver so I have not tried these on gold jewelry."
1,"Its a beautiful ring. It was slighty larger than I was expecting, but that was due to my own estimating, not the seller of the product. The item was delivered in a timely and orderly manner. Great product, and most importantly, it does not turn my finger green after a view times of wearing it. The seller of this product did a wonderful job!"
1,I really like this ring. It is very slim but the stones are pretty. Love the colors. I purchased it for my pinky. It is the perfect sizefor that finger.
1,This item is much prettier than the pic. The price was very good and it was a speedy delivery.thanx for this seller.Jan
0,"I agree with other posted comments about the stones coming out, I opened the cute box, took out the ring, a stone is gone, will not return as it is not worth returning. I believe we are paying for the cute box and not the ring itself, I have a few of these types of rings from other sellers, and no stones have popped out (yet)"
1,"I am slightly OCD so in the summer when I wear rings with colors other than dark red and black I like to have a tie in. It really will go with about anything, I love twisting it around on my finger to look at all the beautiful stones. I love it, and I have worn it every day since I received it."
1,"I ordered 2 of these, and was very pleased with them. I am hard on my jewelry. If I like it, I don't take it off. Thusfar, I haven't lost any stones, and they are as beautiful as the day I bought them. I've had many fine compliments. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this vendor again. the shipping was prompt, and my items well packaged. thanks again, I love them!"
0,"I purchased several of these rings for my daughters for Christmas. They loved the looks of them and were delighted to receive them. However, in less than a month, two of them had stones fall out."
1,"I bought this ring to resell because it was so pretty for the price, and I am going to buy one for myself. It is really attractive and sparkly for what I paid."
1,Very delicate but packs a punch of color. You can wear this with anything. Sure to be a real favorite.
1,"This ring is the size to mix and match your other sterling rings. Just enough ""bling"".Very nice ring!would recommend due to price and looks."
1,I can wear this ring with almost any outfit. It has a lot of classic colors in it that make it possible to accessorize with a lot of clothes. THis ring shipped quickly from a third party shipper.
1,"I was initially skeptical about buying an engagement ring from Amazon. However, the ease of selecting exactly what I wanted and the terrific price convinced me to give it a shot.The ring shipped overnight, insured, via UPS, which allayed a lot of my fears. The package also contained a detailed appraisal (useful for insurance), and an explanation of the cut, clarity, etc. with a visual depiction of where the flaws are (although I can't see them anyway!). Amazon was also excellent about communicating throughout the process - I received emails confirming the order, updating me on the status of the setting and quality of the diamond, and letting me know when to expect delivery. There is a 90 day return policy - in case you're not happy with the ring, or if (god forbid) you are unsuccessful in your proposal.The ring itself was beautiful and showed quality craftsmanship. My fiance was impressed that I ""designed"" such a beautiful ring, and that I could afford such a large center stone. I would highly recommend this service to anyone who wants a customized ring and also wants to save money. The only drawback is that I have to pay for cleanings (they are sometimes included when you buy from a jewelry store)."
1,"The option to custom order a ring is the only way to go. Do a little research on what the different factors mean (diamond clarity, etc.) and you can set your bounds on a ring that matches your specifications and budget. I purchased the ring for my wife (2nd marriage). We've been married for 6 years and both wear plain wedding bands ($15 specials). I had waited far too long to get her something nice and she was absolutely surprised and thrilled when I gave her the box to open. I wouldn't hesitate to use the service for my wife's next surprise."
0,I did not expect much considering the stone. I did assume that the rest of the earings would be so poorly constructed. Buyer beware.
1,"I love this bracelet! The crystals are very shiny. It looks like you're wearing bits of glass on your wrist. It goes with everything and is very comfortable to wear. Of the three web chip bracelets I bought, this one is the shiniest. The width varies a little, but is about 1 1/2 inches."
1,"Beautiful, beautiful piece of art. Very carefully packed, immediate shipment. Thank you for a great deal!"
1,"The drama/comedy earrings came in fast time & are beautiful & very high quality. They made a wonderful gift for my thespian daughter for her college theatrical debut, & were such a hit!Thank you for offering such a perfect find!"
1,"back in the days when gold was affordable i will say yes this was a great buy but i don't think i would get it for this price now since i purchased this over 5 years ago, loved it so much i also got the necklace"
1,Everything was great. Wear my cross every day. Just what I wanted.
0,"I'm not completely happy with this ring. Although it is a great size and mm width and it's flat band, it appears darker in the photo, which is why I bought it. But when it arrived, it is so shiny and white colored, it looks like it's plastic. Like it's from a quarter machine at K-Mart.Oh well, I guess I'll keep it as a back up in case the ring that I am really in love with now gets lost. A black band ring made of Stainless Steel; Surgical Grade 316L. It rocks."
1,"I love these earrings! They're light; I can barely tell I have them on, but they look beautiful with anything from jeans to a sundress."
1,this was a great price. the quality was nice for gold dipped silver...it looked like a gold piece. i was very happy with my purchase
1,"Nice ring, fast delivery. I still need to check it out, because my daughter says it doesn't completely ""break down"" the way my old puzzle ring did."
1,"I absolutely love the look of the ring! My friend took it apart, and I worked on it non-stop for almost a day before I looked up directions on-line. Once I foudn a couple sets, I compared them and it wasn't too bad to put back together.Again, I think the ring is gorgeous."
0,"I ordered this ring and wore it a few times and it got all tarnished! So it is not Stainless Steel, and it wasnt worth sending it back! dont waste your money!!!"
0,"I do like this puzzle ring, even though I have not ventured to take it apart and reassemble it again. On my receipt, I saw an e-mail address for instructions on how to solve it, but the address didn't work. However, there are instructions at another site ([...]) for their claddagh puzzle rings that may be helpful if you can't solve it.All in all, a neat looking ring, but take it apart at your own risk! :)"
1,"This ring is awesome. It is well made and amazing how it fits together. My only complaint is that the idea of a puzzle ring is misleading. I thought that all four bands would come totally apart from each other. I was going to keep two rings for myself and give two rings to another person as a representation that we are two pieces, but when we are together we are whole. The problem is the rings are all inter-looped, so in order to do this I am going to have to cut them and solder them together. The other thing was, which is good for someone who doesn't want to worry about it falling apart....is that once I clipped the white band that was holding it together, it didn't fall all apart. I was expecting it to just fall to pieces. I literally had to struggle and pull at it to get it to come apart....in fact I lost patience in getting it apart and had to give it to someone else to pull apart. So as long as you aren't trying to use it like I wanted to, this ring is perfect for you. It doesn't come apart easily and they are all looped together so you can't lose any of the pieces."
0,"This was given to me as a gift, and the person who gave it to me based the sizing on the sizing of the rest of the rings I wear. However, whatwe discovered is that these rings are a bit bulky (of course, that's what puzzle rings are about!), so mine is a bit too tight. I think Silver Insanity's website has instructions on sizing, but just in case that isn't an option I recommend goinga size larger."
0,"I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring. We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless."
0,"The ring is very pretty, but the instructions to reassemble the ring are useless and you have to be very careful with the individual rings as they are very thin metal."
0,"I loved this ring the moment I saw it, and begged my boyfriend to buy it for me for christmas.When I got it, I immediatly put it on. I thought ""Well, I wonder how it comes apart.""BIG MISTAKE!It still hasn't been put back together, after two months, and every person in my family tried. I suggest that it come with instructions. (yes, even though this defeats the purpose)"
0,"Someone, please help me!!I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP!"
1,"These earrings have become a staple. They are the right size, perfectly crafted and truly beautiful. I've been wearing them non-stop since I bought them. They go with anything!"
1,My friend totally adores the earrings. They looked great on her so I decided to go back and order myself a pair. Thanks
1,These are my favorite earrings
1,"These are solid, durable, adorable earrings. The design is 3 dimensional, so you can wear your hair up or down with them. If mine were eaten by the vacuum cleaner today, I would immediately hop online and buy a new pair."
1,I bought 3 pairs of these for my wife and daughters. I know they like them. They wear them a lot (vs. others I have bought in the past). I'm a hero.
1,"I'd been looking for some time now for a plain platinum band that would fit properly with my catherdral setting engagement ring. The plain bands I'd seen previously were not thick enough and they appeared as if they would slip under the engagment ring. The profile of this ring matchs up perfectly with my engagement ring. The delievery was extremtly quick. I ordered it with free shipping on a Mon. and it arrived that Wed. I am extremely pleased with the quality, price and service I recieved."
1,"On Monday night I placed my order for the Platinum 2.5mm High-Dome Comfort Fit Band. I used the ""Free"" shipping and thought it would take a couple weeks to receive the item. To my surprise, the ring arrived in the mail on Friday (same week).The ring is beautiful and is as described in the item description. Unlike the other review I had read, the band does not say ""Amazon"" on the inside of the band. I would not hesitate to place an order here again."
1,"When this ring arrived, I was very impressed. It was a much larger cross section and higher quality than I expected. It did not say ""Amazon"" on the inside unlike the previous reviews stated. I am very pleased with my purchase."
1,"This is the first ear cuff I've ever purchased, and I have to say, I feel at LEAST 89% cooler now that I have it. ;) It's a genius way to add some extra bling without having to get another piercing. It fits great and is so comfortable I forget it's even there... except when I look in the mirror and realize how hipster I look now. ;)"
1,The earring is great...I have had it for about 6 months now and I still enjoy it. It is not the most comfortable earring but it is a great piece.
1,Love this earring. I have no complaints. It looks great and doesn't feel uncomfortable at all. What's not to like about having another earring without the hassle of additional piercings.
1,"Excellent packaging not one of those little ziploc baggies for storge either. Went on with a little manipulation and once placed where they advised, fit perfectly. I generally sleep in my second set of piercings and dislike having to take earrings in and out. Kept in cuff, slept in it, bathed in it, went kickboxing in it and it stayed in no pain or discomfort and no adjustments. It's realistic looking, my staff thought it was real and wanted to know where I got it. I love the look of the piercings but not enthusiastic about the pain or the healing process. This way i get the best of both worlds. Thinking about ordering one for upper ear!"
1,I love this product! It is comfortable and very believable. They sent it on time and I have gotten so many compliments.
0,"It is an elegant ear cuff and i received it in the cutest packaging and it was so quick! HOWEVER, I'm young and I like to experiment with a lot of different cuffs and earrings and this was wayy too plain for my taste. I was expecting it to have a rhinestone or two or some bling but it was just a plain circular loop, $10 could have beeen better spent somewhere else in my opinion."
1,My husband and I decided to Elope last year and we purchased these rings as matching set and temporary fix until we purchased our real ones...we were excited to receive them the day before our ceremony only to be disappointed with the fact they they are not true to size rings...I ordered a size 8 that didn't go past my knuckle and my husband who wears a size 10 couldn't get it off because since it was such a tight fit...We had to run out and purchase an other set of bands...I would recommend going a size up and aside from that they are nice rings
1,This is the perfect necklace for a new mother. It is a simple but beautiful and meaningful design.
1,I think the neckalace is beautiful. It is so smooth and polished. I bought it as a gift for my daughter in law and I hope she loves it as much as I do.
1,"Very beautiful and came just as described. The only thing I wish is that the chain was a tiny bit longer, but otherwise I love it."
1,This is a beautiful piece. I was excited that I found a piece of jewelry that represents the whole family and not just a mother and child.
0,"The box on this item is insufficient to give as a gift. You will need to purchase a jewlery box for this.The item itself, as many have said is not as 3D. It is rough 1/4 inch wide if you lay it on its back."
1,"Great gift plus a bonus. If you take a look at it in person, not just the picture, you will notice the kid has a butt crack. My wife still loves it but it is a great joke also."
1,My husband bought me this necklace the week we had our first baby and I won't take it off. It's beautiful and I get so many compliments on it! Would recommend to anyone
1,"Got this a surprise gift for my wife and our new born baby daughter. She absolutely loved it! As a topper I had a small 1/4 carat diamond placed in the center, by my jeweler and that made it even more perfect. Great quality.....fast ship!! A very unique gift that she will love!!!"
1,"This was a gift for my oldest daughter and she absolutely loved it! The weight of it is solid, and it's better looking than the picture shows. A gift that I'm sure she'll enjoy for years to come."
0,"People had already warned me it looked more 3 D in the pictures than in reality. I still gave it a try thinking it could not be that bad, but the difference was actually so big that the necklace did not even look nice when I got it in the mail. I had planned on giving it as a Christmas gift, but could not get myself to give this away with joy so I returned it and gave her something else instead."
1,My wife is pregnant with our first. I ordered it as a valentines day present and she loved it. Wears it everyday.
1,"Mom, loved her Christmas gift. I thought the chain was thin, but she thought it was fit the charm perfectly."
1,"I bought this for my wife after she gave birth to our baby daughter (together with a card). After all the pain and stress it was the perfect way to say a humble ""Thank you!"". After all she had to go through the most to make us a little family."
1,"Received this ring 2 days ago and can't stop looking at it. The ring is very solid, the stones are well set, the diamonds have lots of sparkle and the ruby gems have good color considering their small size; not pale at all. You certainly can't go wrong with this ring! The ring is on the small side; a 6 1/2.Katarina Jewelers conduct themselves very professionally. We conversed by phone and by email prior to my purchase, and they shipped my order by overnight delivery. I will definitely buy from them again."
1,I was extremely happy with the product. It was a hit with the wife and the specs that were given couldn't have been more accurate
1,This pendant is beautiful. It's the perfect size and arrived in a very nice box for presentation. My wife loves it. Highly recommended.
1,"Purchased as a gift, and she loved it. Excellent quality product that comes in very nice packaging. Would definitely recommend!"
1,"Bought as a replacement for a lost wedding band. This looks really nice, very happy with the quality for the price. Would order from this place again."
1,"This ring was purchased as a gift for my ,soon to be, wife. She LOVES green so the ring was a hit with her. She is not a gemstone-type gal and I think it was her first diamond ring. She loves it and does not take it off very often."
1,"My wife loved this piece of jewelry when I presented it to her for Hanukkah. She has been wearing it every day. In real life, it is even more beautiful, a real work of artisanship. The design on the back is as nice as the design on the front, just in case your necklace gets turned around. Artazia has good customer service too. They wrote to me to check on whether or not I liked the jewelry and I appreciated the personal touch."
0,"I agree that these Artazia pieces are unique and very ""girly."" However if you're looking for something that embodies a bit more of the spirituality of this ancient sacred symbol, you might want to look elsewhere. I hate to say it, but these Artazia pieces look a bit like the Star of David in a ""tarted up"" version.I prefer the elegant, gorgeous Star of David pendants by Israeli designer David Weitzman. (For more info check my profile.) These are modern reinterpretations of the powerful Star of David symbol, yet they still carry an amazing spirit of esoteric beauty and religious wonderment. Whatever your faith or ancestry, his pieces will inspire and uplift you."
1,"I saw this ring on another site for a lot more money and am glad I bought it here instead. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it -- it really draws the eye. Fast delivery, beautiful ring."
1,"I love these earrings. I'm a teacher and wear them to school when we are learing about bones. I also always wear these earrings near Halloween, they are a hit with the kids!"
0,"I really liked these earrings, however the pendulum in the middle kept getting stuck on things. I wish they would have made it stationary."
1,"My review title pretty much sums it up. This is a high quality ear cuff--strong as ever and a perfect gold tone with great shine. I also love its simplicity; makes it comfortable to wear casually, but still looks elegant with dressy bottom earrings. And as someone who has bought many earcuffs of varying quality, this price is amazing for what you get. Easy to slip on, and it's comfortable. I mostly buy jewelry I can put on and forget about--I wear it in the shower, and even to bed."
1,I gave this item to my granddaughter and she loved it. First because there was no piercing involved and it fit perfectly and also she said it was no problem putting it on because of the instructions that were included with the item. Her friends noticed it and wanted to know where she got it..they should be ordering very soon...
0,This was a nice item until it fell off my ear. Put it on just as advertised but it still fell off and got lost.
1,"Well made, stand out, comfortable, have maintain their shiny appearance even when wearing them day in and day out. Looks good with casual wear as well as dressy clothing."
1,"Really nice earcuff look so sexy I made a mistake and buy only one now I know how material and how lookreturn for more , very happy costumer and they have the best costumer service too , come on time I recoment this product if you want to see so sexy"
1,"Big fan, love the cufflinks! I get compliments on them all the time! I wanted something a little different but also nice and these definitely fit. I wish they changed the direction of the pieces so that they covered the cufflink-hole in the shirt better, but not a big deal. Still really like them!"
1,I ordered these for my daughter. They came well before the deadline and are of terrific quality--they are very sturdy. They're really nice looking too.
1,"I just got these earrings from my sister for Christmas and I absolutely love them! She knew I liked celtic knot jewelry and this style and size fits me perfectly. They look better than pictured, are sturdy, and intricate in design. I plan to wear them with jeans and for evenings out. Highly recommend."
1,These earrings are danty and very pretty. I love them and could wear them everyday. I recommend them to anyone who likes celtic jewelry.
1,small but not too small; very classy and goes with everything silverfast shipping; pleasure to work with
1,These earrings are very pretty and the right size!! Being Irish I am always looking for Celtic jewelry that's classic looking and these are it!! Thank you!
1,"Pretty earrings, I like to use them for a more casual look. Good quality earrings, they also arrived quickly which is always nice."
1,"My daughter finished school, and I was looking for a precent for her. I think this ring is a great present for her. She liked this ring very much!"
0,This is a cute ring for the price. I was looking for a replacement for my wedding ring. This did not work. I promised my 5yr. old daughter this ring when her finger is big enough.
0,"It's very pretty and good quality, but small and dainty. I recommend this ring for women who are looking for a cute look."
1,This ring is gorgeous and my daughter is going to love it. The photo doesn't do it justice and the shipping was FAST!
1,Bought this for my sister who was my maid of honor - she loved it. Get it and you wont regret it
1,I bought two pairs of these earrings. I wear them all the time. They are sturdy and beautiful.
1,"I purchased these earrings, the matching ring, and the matching necklace...stunning jewelry. I get so many comments about how gorgeous these items are every time I wear one. I have purchased these items as Christmas presents for family members who loved them as a surprise. They are all sturdy, high quality items that I am proud to wear. I could not recommend them more highly, and, the price is unbeatable!"
1,"I really like these earrings. I also bought ""Large Sterling Silver Celtic Knot Hook Dangle Earrings"" and both pairs are wonderful. Excellent quality!"
1,I love the quality of these ~ well worth the inexpensive price. They have a thickness and presence that gets many compliments and can be worn daily with anything! Highly recommend these earrings as a gift or for a treat for yourself. you won't be dissappointed in their uniqueness and quality.
1,"These are lovely, elegant and light to wear. I felt quite chic wearing them. They go with everything."
1,"I feel in love with this pendant when I stumbled upon it a few days ago, so I went ahead and ordered it. Shipping was super fast, ordered on Tuesday, Nov 30th and received it Fri, Dec 3rd. The item is a bit pricey, but worth it! Not heavy at all when wearing it, you tend to forget you have it on. The chain (19"") is a little short for my neck, but I already have another chain prepared for it, so I'm not too concerned about that. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product, and will definitely buy from this seller again."
1,This is quite simply the most exquisite pendant I have bought in a very long time. It's quality and high shine is equal to any top end jewelry stores. Very pleased with this purchase. Perfect for an adult or a young teenager. Goes with everything. I can't say enough about this beautiful piece of jewelry.
1,I got this for my wife on V-Day and she loved it! I really don't know to put in words on how great this celtic knot pendant it! I'll come back and buy more products from this company for sure.
1,"I bought this for myself after checking out other items, the reviews were good, so I decided to go with it. Yes! I am very pleased, I only wish I would have ordered the chain at the same time.....live and learn."
1,This is the most beautiful pendant I own. Came in such a timely manner. Will surly buy from this vendor again.The description & picture of it was very on target.Actually prettier than picture.Highly recommend.
1,"This ring is very nice and strong. Though the sizes are wrong on the ad, and the company gave me misinformation, I ordered it anyway, the ring came in size 10, not 9.5 or 10.5 as in the ad. But as for the ring, it is well built and will hold up well and you will not be dissapointed."
1,The emerald is the same color shown on the site. The jewelry came in pretty box .Green draws attention until brown clothes.Size is adequate (length 7 mm) and weight 2 grams (10 oz).The 6 diamonds shine quite . The ring is comfortable and emerald highlights.A jewelry street sells this type of jewelry more expensive .
0,"These are sturdy and well made, but the six prongs add a lot of metal and take away from the gemstone. That may be the way the heart shape has to be set to make it secure, but I dodn't like it. In addition, the prongs are long which makes the gemstone sit high and away from your ear and they stick out from the earlobe."
1,"I received this ring about 2 weeks ago and I am very pleased with it. I liked it when I first saw it online because it was different from the norm, for im not one who is into the flashy diamond scene. Im more of a toned down type of woman. The ring is very reasonably priced and is a lot thicker than the traditional women's wedding band. I would highly recommend this type of wedding band for any woman who dares to defy the norm. On an even greater note, I am getting married November 3rd, 2007, Hooray!"
1,"This is a beautiful, classic piece. My husband got mucho brownie points for this one. A good choice for anyone you want to show your love to!"
1,"My husband got me this as a gift for valentines day. I just loved it.This chain would suit any occasion casual or formal. The chain is of right length, although thin. The chain is solid(not the kind you get with some pendants)so it looks good on your neck. The pendant is nicely designed and diamonds though small look sparkly.This would make a great gift for your special someone."
1,"I bought this, and changed my mind, so I intended to send it back-that was until I opened the box. This beautiful little floater is bright, shimmery, and I'm pretty good with my diamonds and the 4 c's.I would recommend this to anyone-one complaint, the chain could be far better for this item, however, it is a deal and gorgeous. The heart is about the size of a dime, but especially worn choker style, this is an eye catcher!"
1,Very nice earring jacket.Be sure to order the center stud earrings separately becausethey are not included.
1,"Jewelry is always close to the heart of every woman and that is why I decided to get a diamond pendant for my wife on her birthday. When I browsed to check for a suitable pendant on Amazon I noticed the Katarina diamond pendant. I was impressed by the image displayed. It was actually made of freshwater pearls, sapphire and diamond set in white gold. The pendant was more attractive in real than in picture. My wife could not contain her surprise looking at the pendant and she thanked me for adding one more to her collection."
1,"Just as my title states- this item was purchased as a gift. My friend loves the pendant, but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse."
1,I was looking for something to organize / store my growing collection of rings and this fit the bill exactly. It's compact so it fits into a drawer and latches securely. The slots hold rings of different widths & thicknesses. Very nice!
1,"I purchased this pendant for my fiance on her birthday, her name is Cherry, so it was a very special presentshe liked it sooo much, and the shown photo really doesn't show its beautyit looks prettier on real lifeand I guerentee you that your girl is gonna like it too"
1,"Vermeil (24k Gold over Sterling Silver) Simulated White Opal and Genuine Diamond Accent X and Oval Pattern BraceletI gave my nieces these earrings for Christmas and they were thrilled with their beauty and their mother was delighted with their simplicity. The girls said they were their first ""good"" jewelry and they looked smashing on them. Beautifully made with the subtle and mysterious shades of the opal, they've become a cherished part of these early teens' collections."
1,This is a beautiful ring. The stone is very clear and really sparkles. The setting is solid silver and the band is solid. There is a lot of silver in this ring and it is beautifully finished.
1,"I ordered this ring and was so amazed at how beautiful it was. I figured that for the price it would be pretty, but not to expect much. Well, was I surprised at how beautiful my ring is. I would recommend this ring to anyone."
1,"I would always receive complements on these cuff-links. They are so beautiful. I'm server and would wear them with my white, button-down shirt. It was my little way of trying to add sparkle and some femininity to my uniform."
1,"I bought this ring on Wednesday night and got it Saturday. Very quick!I got this ring as a possible stand in for my real E-ring when we went on vacation.I got it the day before my engagement party. During the engagement party, I had this ring and another fake ring (also from the same company) and my real engagement ring on my finger and asked people which one was real. About one 1/3rd said this ring was real.People trying to guess the ring from the band thought this was the real ring b/c of the detail work on the band itself.It was very impressive for the price.My FI is very impressed that I got such real looking rings for the price I paid."
0,"These cufflinks were made to last for only 3 days. The next day you try to put them on, they will just break on you. Very terrible welding ""welding over paint or something"" watch the pictures I took after they failed on me.Don't buy them if you want something that last more than 3 days."
1,"At first i was looking for an engagement ring for my now fiance, but she saw the blood diamond movie, so she asked me to get a ""Non diamond ring"", honestly i dont think that i could have done better, this ring is really nice, it took a trip to the jewelry because of the size of my girl's hand, but everything was perfect"
0,"I really like the style and feel of this ring.However, the stone is much smaller than in the picture. It's about half the size of an eraser at the end of a pencil. I was disappointed in that."
1,"Was very pleased with this item, I wear it on my middle finger. I have received many compliements. No problems, rate this item 5 stars."
0,"I bought this ring because it was cute and the few reviews it had were great. I got the ring relatively fast like 2 days after i ordered, but I didn't even have the ring on for 24hours and my finger started to turn green. That is NOT ok since it is supposed to be sterling silver. I have only had this problem with one other ring I bought off of amazon but never again will I buy from this seller. I am returning the ring and going to get my money back. I wouldn't have even given it a star, but I had to give it something in order to write my review. I never write bad reviews but that is how upset I am because the ring was beautiful."
0,"Item was great but in no hurry to ship. I was told that I would get the item within 6-10 day. Well lets try 15 days latter. I even called them a few times and they always told me ""Oh it will go out the next day."" Wrong, I am not sure what the next day is to them."
0,Bought this for a friend for Christmas. Although the cord was very durable the actual chess piece was not. She wore it constantly and never took it off. It lasted for about 3 months before the hook connecting the charm to the cord broke. I'm assuming it broke from too much wear and tear since she works in a daycare.On the upside it was very detailed despite its small size. Not sure if I would buy it again or not but I might since my friend really liked wearing it.
1,This necklace was one of the most unique pieces I have ever found. I loved it so much I ended up getting a tattoo of it. I bought it over two years ago and still wear it to this day.
1,"But, I wasn't disappointed. The design is extremely detailed. And, the one that I got was subtly parabolic. Which I actually love about it more. So, yeah, I can recommend this pendant."
1,I was looking for an unique gift for my daughter after passing her RN. It was more beautiful than I thought it would be and she loves the bracelet.
1,My daughter fell in love with this ring and just had to have it! It fulfilled all of her expectations. Very pretty ring for a super price! Thanks!
1,it is just so cute - I love it. I like dainty rings and this one is perfect for me. I will order another in a different color. Size was perfect. I like the band the way it tapers toward the stone. arrived as scheduled in an adorable little boutique box that would be perfect if for gift giving!
0,I gave this ring to my sister and she seems to like it. My sister says that CZ jewelry looks good and can be worn in the workplace without the fear of losing a valuable gem.
1,"First I had asked my wife to order me a pendant and she did so through an online source, WELL after two weeks passed I figured the order wasnt received so went to Amazon.com found the pendant I was looking for, ordered it and received the order within 5 business days. The pendant is exactly how it was described...I am very please with my purchase, THANK YOU AMAZON...."
1,Excellent quality.Bought as gift . Receiver loved it. Good price as well. I recommend. Let everyone know you love Jesus.
1,"These charms are all slightly difficult to put on, but this one was nice, clear and to the point. fancy looking, but for those who love a classy looking name, it's nice for the price and how it looks."
0,"I purchased this ring for my mother for her birthday, and I also purchased one in peridot for myself. The stone was so dark that mom thought it was a dark blue sapphire,sadly, I had to tell her it was actually an amethyst. The setting is beautiful and I really enjoy my peridot version, and my mom really likes her dark purple amethyst version. I would recommend this purchase."
1,"This is a beautiful product that she loved when I gave it to her. The stones are well set and it looks like it costs far more than it actually does. The one thing I must say is that, if you plan on getting it re-sized, you will likely find that cannot be done, at least in my experience. However, if it is the right size, this is a wonderful piece that I highly recommend."
1,"It was much prettier in person than the picture. I bought it as a gift, and would like one for myself, but they are currently sold out."
1,this ring is beautiful and just what I was looking for. My son's highschool mascot is a bear and this ring is perfect for him.
1,My 10 year old daughter is a flutist and she adored these earrings.....she can only wear real jewelry or she has a bad reaction. So I was very happy when I found these!
1,We purchased this for my sister who was graduation nursing school. She really liked it. It seemed like it was well-made and more expensive than what we paid for it.
1,This is a perfect gift to give to a person right before they finish nursing school so they can wear it to their pinning ceremony!!!!!
1,Orded this as a gift for a friend who just became a nurse and could not be more pleased. The bracelet is very nice in person and the detail is beyond great for the low price. Definitely recommend as a gift or personal buy.
1,We gave them to our six Nursing Supervisors at our hospital for Supervisor Day and they were perfect. They looked better than the picture showed and the shipping was quick. Would buy from again and recommend to everyone.
1,"I bought this bracelet for a friend who was graduating from nursing school. When I received it however, the heart was broke into 2 pieces (front and back). I immediately contacted the seller and within a few days I had a new one shipped to me, no questions asked, in perfect condition. It's such a cute bracelet I now want one for myself!"
1,"I gave this bracelet to my niece for graduation from UK. I liked it so much I ordered myself one (yeah...I'm a nurse, too). I think every nurse should treat herself to such a nice bracelet. Be proud of who you are...NURSES!!"
1,"Such a nice, solid, ring. I love the inlay work and the ring has a nice solid feel."
1,"It was exactly as I hoped it would be, actually it's even more beautiful in person! Prompt service and delivery."
1,"I BROUGHT THESE FOR MY SECOND HOLE IN MY EAR, SO IT IS JUST WHAT I EXPECTED (SMALL AND CUTE). QUALITY IS NICE! THE EARRINGS WILL BE GREAT AS A 1ST PAIR FOR YOUR LITTLE PRINCESS."
1,"I have been looking for a simple earring and I am glad that I could find it here. If you ever make a smaller size like 2mm, please send me a note because I would be interested in purchasing them also.Thanks!"
1,"mine got a little bent so it's not perfect, but the velvet has a nice texture and I wear it all the time (I've had it for about four months now). I also really like the length; not too long, so I can wear it with pretty much anything--which is exactly what I needed."
1,The product was delivered fast and accurately. Good product. I used them for necklaces for Swavorski crystal pendants and they were of quality enough to be paired with this type of crystal.
0,"Nice, but very transparent blue in color. Not even close to the color in the picture. Order one size bigger. For the price, I'll probably order more in different colors."
0,"Unfortunately, this was a gift and I cannot return it. It is nothing but cheap junk, definitely not sterling silver. Like another reviewer said, it is more like painted plastic. Save your money and time."
1,I'd been looking for a silver bracelet for quite some time. I love this bracelet! Great look. Wears well. Have it on today!!
1,"THis product is so awsome, it is light but I was aware of this before I bought it and it;'s sterline silver. I just love it. And it's came in great timing, shiney and in a nice black velvet coated box."
0,"This product is not sterling silver as advertised. It appeared to be some sort of plastic sprayed to be silver. I took the product to two jewellers to ascertain the nature of the material. They could not determine on simple examination the nature of the material. However, both confirmed my suspicions that the material was not sterling silver."
1,"This is a lovely, chunky silver bracelet, with a wonderfully large clasp that is nice to look at and easy to use. This bracelet has presence"
1,This was a really nice bracelet for the price---I paid almost twice as much for one elsewhere and it is almost identical except this one is wider and has a better weight to it---I would highly recomend this bracelet.
1,This bracelet is fabulous. Looks great! It is well worth the money. I would consider buying another one for a Christmas gift.
1,"Beautiful earrings, a little less classical than most diamond drop earrings that I have seen on Amazon, so they look great with an evening dress and great with jeans, heels and a jacket during daytime. They feel solid, are well done. My husband was a bit sceptical when seeing them on the website but was convinced when I wore them for the first time. I bought them at a discount for USD 370 and they are certainly worth that. Arrived perfectly within the estimated shipping time as well."
0,This product did a good job. Used it in conjunction with the steam cleaning machine and my jewelry came out very sparkling.
1,I love the pearl cleaner and it has great lasting ability to clean multiple pearl strands or other pearl jewelry... it came quickly ... very good!
1,"I received an electronic jewerly cleaner for Christmas and neededthe solution, so I bought it here. It works very good."
0,I ordered this product from Blitz and they sent me the non-concentrate solution in the bottle that has the brush and cleaner. How am I supposed to use this with my Ultrasonic Cleaner? Thanks Blitz...
1,I bought this along with the Sonic Wave jewelry cleaner for my daughter in law for Christmas. She couldn&#34;t wait to clean her jewelry! She was very pleased with this product.
1,works well lasts a long time can hardly wait to order more I highly recommend it to all of you
1,"I did use a ultrasonic cleaner with just water and was satisfied, but this makes a big difference in how clean it gets your jewelry."
1,cleans my jewelry so well. I was a little nervous at first. thought my gold plated rings and watches would turn color but the gold stayed intact and looks brand new.
1,"I love this product. It makes my jewelry sparkle! When I clean my engagement ring, I often get one or two comments that day about how beautiful it is. This product really does a good job of removing the daily grime that builds up on jewelry."
1,Does a great job cleaning jewelry. Very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely be returning to buy more. Jewelry sparkles and looks like new.
1,This product cleaned the jewelry perfectly and made to diamonds shine. I would recommend the product to anyone that uses an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner.
0,"When I started looking for a good jewelry cleaning machine, I came across this one, and was unsure about these machines anyway, But I started to read the reviews and they sounded pretty good. So I went ahead and ordered it, received it quickly and tried it out right away. I thougt the little light would light up but it did not so this one must not have one, so did not know it was working at that time, Then I expected tiny little bubbles to occur in the water when turned on, there were no bubbles, so I was really unsure if it was working, So just waited til it was done with the time. When I took the rings out they did look cleaner, but I usually keep my stuff pretty clean anyway.. So as of right now, still a bit skeptical with it. I guess I need to get my rings real dirty and then try again..."
1,This cleaner works very well. When I've used it the jewelry came out very clean and crystals very shiny. Good purchase.
1,Really works. Be carefull of loose stones.This will clean out the gunk that may be the only thing holding themShines Gold and Silver better than plain water.
0,"I am not sure if this does what it says it does....I mean...I have an ultra sonic tank and I use this stuff but I can't always get it to smell right...my watch smells like sweat when I don't wash it...stainless band...this stuff makes it smell alright for a day...but so does water, but I leave everything in there from when I go to sleep, then when I wake up, I put it on after it dries...but I don't know, I don't have anything to put this up against...but if I run out...I might buy it again..like i said...a day...and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg :)"
0,"I purchased this concentrated cleaner, based upon the other reviews, for use in an ultrasonic jewelry cleaning unit. The picture of the cleaner on the Amazon website is labeled as ""concentrate"" and in a tall slender bottle. The package that I received is in a short, standard size undiluted cleaner container for direct placement of jewelry - it even contains the standard basket and mini-brush. The container has an overlay of a label that says ""concentrate,"" but I don't know if that was placed there by the merchant that shipped it (Living Essentials), or Blitz. Also, I don't know if what I received is really the concentrate version or the full strength solution. If it is the concentrate, I don't know the recommended dilution to use, since it is not in the concentrate bottle and the directions on the container state to place jewelry in the basket and agitate gently for 3 minutes. I cannot attest to the efficacy of the product, as I have not used it to clean jewelry and am still debating about if/how I should use it, diluted or undiluted."
1,I bought a jewelry cleaning machine and the soltion as well. It definately cleans very well and does work on all jewelry types. You only need a small amount so one bottle will last a while.
1,This product is wonderful! I use it to clean all my jewelry and it comes out like brand new! Will definitely be buying this again!!
1,This jewelry cleaner works great with the DB-Tech Digital Ultrasonic Cleaner. What can I say it works really well and makes your jewelry and eye glasses sparkle and shine.
0,This product didn't work. Besides I follow the use procedures. I waste my money out. I do not recomend this product.
1,"I did use it with a sonicator, but I had one necklace that I think was made with nickel (Silver),it was completely tarnish (Black). The clearner made it look new again. I used it to clean all my cosmetic jewelry and it just spackles. I would buy again."
1,Bought this item for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. While I was visiting her we threw in some of my jewelery. It never looked so clean and bright. Good product and easy to use.
0,"These boxes arrived looking very dirty. They were able to be cleaned up, but still that shouldn't be needed. The inserts were also for earrings, not a necklace/pendant as described. Luckily that didn't affect us as the inserts were tossed out anyways (we needed something for bracelets in bags to be given as gifts)."
1,"Very nice pendant, I bought it for myself when I saw it featured on Amazon. The pendant is even a bit bigger than I had thought it would be and a very shiny silver. The chain looks well made to me and is just the right lenght and it looks goregeous on my neck.My husband will probably make fun of me when he sees me wearing it since all he can associate the triquetra with is the tv show Charmed, (as if the tv show itself invented this symbol) but oh well. I love celtic jewlery so this is perfect for me."
0,"This necklace looks exactly how it is pictured. There is absolutely nothing special about it. In fact,it looks like a cheap piece of costume jewelry."
1,"I got this on sale for my wife. She really liked it, so did her friends. The whole thing (heart and chain) weighs 1/2 an ounce, a nice hunk of silver. It is 0.925 pure (sterling) so at 10 bucks it is a great buy. I wish the chain was 3"" longer but it is advertised as 18"" so I can't fault it for that. It's a great ""no special occasion"" gift."
1,This is thicker and nicer than I expected for that price. I love it
1,"I bought this for my wife as a Valentine's day present. I had some concerns after receiving it because it is a fairly heavy chain, and my wife is a slender woman. I didn't want it to overpower her appearance. However, my wife loves it and it looks great on her. It is not a choker, but it hangs close to the throat. The heart is sturdy enough that I had both the front and back engraved and it looks very nice. The clasp is safe and a nice touch because it is different."
1,I love this necklace that I ordered. It's fabulous! The only con was that I thought the necklace would be a lot of longer and the heart would be a lot larger as well. It sort of looks like a choker on my neck.
0,"I return the necklace on the 7 of Dec., Amazon receive it on the 11 of Dec. Still waiting for my credit."
0,I was very disappointed in this item. When they arrived they looked like they were made of plastic. They were so cheap. In addition I paid a large amount of money to have the delivered on Feb 14 and they did not arrive until 11:00pm that night. Completely unacceptable but of course I did not get a refund b/c it was delivered on that date.Amazon advertized that they could deliver on that day and completely messed up my v-day. I will never order from them again if under a deadline.Do not waste your time on these cheap products!
1,This men's ID bracelet is a very high quality sterling silver and looks absolutely wonderful. I had it engraved by a local jeweler; it came out great. I am completely pleased with this item and couldn't ask for anything better. It made an impressive gift.
1,"I purchased this bracelet as a birthday gift for my husband. It's heavy and thick. I was a bit surprised to see that the id plate did not have a satin or matte like in the picture however, you definitely get your money's worth.I actually took it to a local jeweler and had them tell me it wasn't silver because it was too heavy. I think that he didn't have the right equipment to engrave it so that was all he could say.My husband will love it just as much as I do."
0,would have sent it back but i forgot about it and waited too long. It loos cheap and very fake. hate it.
1,"On Christmas morning, my daughter opened this and was ecstatic. She loves the bracelet!"
1,This key chain is simple and elegant. Perfect for a man or woman. Can be monogrammed very nicely.
1,I bought this for my Dad over a year ago and it is holding up fine. He uses this and likes it allot. Great Golf present.
1,"My husband works for a freight company and pushes and pulls heavy boxes all day long. This ring is perfect. It has the milgrain accent around the edges to make it a little more elegant and yet is still plain and durable enough to whether his roughness on it. This ring was a great buy, the cheapest I found it on another site was $120.00. At this price with the free shipping too, I really got a great deal."
1,"This ring is also great for brides. She loved it, just loved it. The first thing she said is how shiny and clean it looks, loved the milgrain.We couldn't ask for better bands."
1,"I bought this for my mother-in-law as a mother's day gift. This heart to me, is the representation of a madonna and child and therefore would suit the date perfectly. When I got it I liked it right away. It's not too little, there is a heaviness added to the piece as it's not paper thin. The adjustable snake chain that comes with it is pretty convenient too. My Mom loved it."
1,"For a little glitter and glitz, this is perfect. The clasp keeps it safe on your wrist, and thecost makes it affordable. It is the perfect ""fun"" braclet, for dress up or just because.18K Gold over Sterling Silver CZ Square & Round Tennis Braceletby SilverSpeck.com"
1,"I BOUGHT THIS WEDDING BAND FOR MY HUSBAND, FOR OUR LAS VEGAS WEDDING. IT HAS HIS FRIENDS DYING OF ENVY. THEY LOVE THE DETAIL AND FIT.THANK!"
1,My wife loved it! As advertized. Looks more beautiful in person than what the picture showed. Showed up on time and no problem.
1,I was quite pleased with this pin. It is well made and reasonably priced.
0,The 24k gold over stirling silver is very pale and looks nothing like 24k.The product was received 7 days after the maximum shipping date.Very disappointed.
1,"I always end up getting a few compliments when I wear this one. It can go casual or formal, good size, great price."
1,"I honestly wasn't expecting much for $1.99 although I did buy two of them. What a surprise though. Very very nice little bracelets. Very tiny white creamy bead type pearls with irregular shapes that look very good that way and fit on my wrist very easily and look great. I pushed them up my arm a bit so that they fit a little tighter, looks better that way I think. Identical I think as well to what is pictured on the amazon page. I also own expensive pearls and no they aren't as nice as those but for the money it's a sweet somewhat elegant look. Especially when you wear two of them together. And yes they definately are cute and stretchy. Not bad for 5 bucks altogether. It ain't Mikimoto but I am absolutely satisfied."
1,"I could not believe how great this bracelet looked when I got it. If you're looking for an ""Oh my gosh!"" response, then I recommend getting this bracelet. My girl is now the envy of all her female relatives and friends. No one has seen a bracelet constructed like this one. The pictures don't do it justice. The jewels are well set and have stood up to even a toddlers ardent inspection. A great buy. Thank you"
0,"It was beautiful in the that week we had it. Unfortunately the clasp didn't hold and now it's gone. Have another letter which is fine, maybe we just got a dud or maybe it's a problem with the K."
1,"Bought it for my boyfriend and he LOVES it, wears it every day. Just the right size and weight, better than I expected."
1,VERY NICE.PERFECT LENGTH AND HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLING. VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS.
1,"This bracelet is so pretty. It can be worn with nearly anything as it is somewhere between a celtic style, bohemian style, or modern style. The moonstone is so pretty and full of depth of color. I keep looking at it all day when I wear it. It feels organic on me, very natural to wear, and the cuff was bendable ever-so-slightly to give a snug fit. Love it!"
1,"These are the best to care for your silver jewelry. My brother is a silversmith, and these are all he will use."
1,"This polishing cloth is awesome. I used it on a David Yurman bracelet, and the bracelet looks brand new without removing any of the oxidation. I would agree with the others that it would be best if you wear gloves especially if the items you are cleaning are very tarnished. Excellent purchase."
1,"After years of only wearing gold jewelry I have gone back to silver. I forgotthat you have clean silver. Did my research, and these are the best for cleaning silver jewelry. Fast and Easy. This is the product most jewelry makers use. If you wear silver, you need to have a few on hand."
1,My 14k gold bracelet was looking a little dull. I have polished it in the past using my Dremel tool/polishing wheel and jeweler's rouge which did an excellent job. This cloth works almost as well for restoring a mirror like shine. For all but scratches this cloth does a fine job of restoring the luster. Note
1,Bought it as a gift. Shipped it fast even at the holiday. Couldn't beat the price. My mom loves it.
1,"First & Foremost I'd like to thank Silver Insanity for selling such a wonderful item. I ordered this ring on the 16th of July and when I checked the tracking it listed that the estimated arrival would be on the 21st. When I came home tonight after a long day at a concert, I noticed that it came in the mail.Very fast delivery and excellent quality!!! I'm in love with the great detail that it provides, Just like the picture! I don't usually wear rings, but I think this will be on my finger for a long while. You get the beautifully designed ring along with a velvet (not sure if it is or not, but it's somewhat soft) pouch to keep it in when not wearing. Would possibly be a great Birthday or Christmas gift. I would recommend this to anyone who likes spiders or is into the Gothic Look.I FREAKING LOVE THIS RING!!!! :D"
1,"This ring is completely different from any other ring she'll have...and she'll love it! I gave this to my gf, amongst other things, for our half-year celebration, and she wears it every day! Additionally, you can't see it in the picture of the ring, but the cut adds a nice sparkle to the sunflower whenever any light touches it."
0,They wouldn't ship to an APO so I had to have it sent to my sister and then she sent it to me. It is very badly made. The writing is so close to the top of the square it is hard to read. The chain left a black residue on my wrist when i tried it on. It is so gritty I know I will never wear it. Save your money!
0,"It serves the purpose, but it seemed to me that the image was a lot prettier and sparklier than it turned out to be. I wear it more than the necklace since it does not look as bad with my clothing."
0,"I was happy to find a reasonably-priced medical bracelet! I expected that I could specify whether I was type I or type II with a charm or on the back of the plate. When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it is already set for type II diabetics."
1,"I got this item quick and just as advertised. I did think it would be a little bigger though. However, after seeing it put together (on the bracelet) you wouldn't want it much bigger. Nice product."
1,"First off. I love Amazon. I always shop here. And have never had a problem EVER. And I just received my new necklace from Silver Insanity. I bought a 30"" snake 2mm. And it is beautiful. I will be a repeat buyer from this site. Thank You."
0,"I ordred this product because I'm allergic to Penicilin and although it's comfortable to wear, it is a major headache to put it on, it has a sort of hook that was hard to figure out. Plus it's not very strong, I've accidentally snapped it a couple of times but was able to put it back together."
0,It Was really nice for about three weeks then it broke. and its been in the drawer ever since. better spend more money and buy one that wont break.
1,Excellent product. Heavy copper links with sturdy fastener. Couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.
1,"I highly recommend buying these if you have any kind of hand ailments. They are not a complete cure, but they sure ease the pain. I always heard copper was good for arthritis, and did some reading on the subject. Since these were not too expensive, I decided to give it a try and purchased two (one for each hand). Give them a try, they do work!"
1,"If you want to wear copper (it works for me) this bracelrt excels. Solid & secure, no gimmicks just copper."
1,I bought this bracelet for my husband because it was our 22nd anniversary and the gift is to be of copper. Since he has been wearing it he said his knuckle that had been bothering for quite some time now feels better. The bracelet is sized generously so it can fit a large wrist easily. It will be very lose on someone with a smaller wrist.
1,My husband was very pleased with this bracelet - it helps to relieve the arthritis pain in his fingers.The speed of delivery to our house was great...and without the expense of special delivery.
1,Can not go wrong with this locket! It exceeded my expectations. Perfect for the horse lover. Beautiful!
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-law. I was very impressed with it's beauty when I opened the mailing package. It looked nice in the pictures but if was much nicer when I got to see it in person. It's also very thick and sturdy, which is always a plus."
1,"The chain arrived super quick. It looks exactly as pictured. Nice sturdy piece of jewerly, great for holding charms. I would purchase this again for myself or as a gift."
1,Beautiful bracelet.Very comfortable to wear.I wanted something that was sturdy but pretty and this bracelet fills the bill.It's very easy to wear and the length is perfect.I was afraid the double links would make it bulky and uncomfortable but it is suprisingly light.I wear it 24/7 and have had no problems with it so far.I haven't added any charms yet but plan to in the future.I am very happy with this purchase.
1,"i love this product... it is really nice and it was on time, looks really nice and my parents love it"
1,My daughter ordered these as gifts for some of her girlfriends. The price was exceptional and her friends really loved them.
1,The message is very positive and it looks very pretty. I bought it for my aunt as a present and the color is very nice.
1,I gave this bracelet to my niece for Christmas. She's a competitive swimmer and loved alll the words on it.
0,"For the price, the diamond that comes in this setting, i felt was impressive. it has some fire to it, and it's raised in the setting [not shown from the angle that this picture is taken at -- making the ring MUCH taller than one would imagine], to catch light not only from the top, but from the bottom and sides as well.Again, this image is deceiving. The ring is a lot taller than shown here. Overall the rest of the ring is of good quality as well; the gold isn't cheap or flimsy. I liked it, but it was not what I was expecting.The, &quot;expidited shipping&quot; was nothing of the kind. I ordered this ring on the 12th of Dec., which I felt was plenty of time to receive it in time to make my wedding proposal on the 20th; my girlfriend's birthday*. I did make it a point to explain this to Szul, as well as to encourage them to please give me some way to track the shipment.Well, 10 days, about 5 emails and about 15 phone calls later (not to mention several strands of hair pulled out in frustration), I still got no tracking. All they did was try to tell me that the ring would arrive some time between the 17th and the 19th.I think the ring finally did arrive -- on the 22nd.She said yes, by the way, so I do guess the ring was a hit after all the agony of getting it here."
1,I am so pleased with this piece. It looks terrific and I have received many compliments. It arrived quickly and the price was fabulous!!! Can't go wrong with this necklace!!!
0,Yes it looks good but this one i purchased lost it shine as it may have been a manufacturing default
0,"This is my fault for believing or imagining what I am seeing in picture.When it arrived it was nothing but a metal stamped piece of jewelry and it wasn't what I would call ""Solid"" gold.I will limit my jewelry purchases to items I am sure of in the future."
1,These earrings are so comfortable to wear. Quick and easy to put on. They have a nice movement and add a catchy sparkle to your ears.
1,"Very sparkly, and bigger than anticipated, which was a nice surprise. Great quality crystal beads, and the necklace that came with it was great quality silver as well. I get compliments every time I wear it!"
0,"Look! I know this ring is NOT available at this time, but as long as you have it listed you should tell the truth about it. I bought this ring from Amazon in 2007, and there is NO WHITE GOLD anywhere on it. That's just a photo-illusion. Plus, there are ONLY 30 DIAMONDS on it, not 34 as listed. You can count them yourself from the picture. Either CORRECT the description, or remove this item entirely from the listings. Thanks!"
1,"The locket is just what I was looking for - something sturdy, beautiful and the right size to hold a keepsake. I am very happy with it."
0,"The ring is very dainty. It does have some sparkle. The band is very thin, which I liked about it because I have very petite hands. The only problem is that I've had the ring for about a month and a diamond has already fallen out."
1,I got these a couple of years ago and I realy like them. I've gotten many compliments on them. Mine look like they are very nice quality earrings.
1,Everytime I wear these earrings people tell me how much they love them. They feel great on and are the cutest I have ever owned. They came very fast and I will buy from this company again.
1,"Though I own many earings, these are undoubtedly my favorite. I have recieved many compliments on them and they are hightly coveted by friends and family. They are the perfect size to be casual, but still very pretty."
1,"Got this for a friend as a present who likes naruto/anime. It came before the estimated date which was nice, and its very good quality."
1,"I got this for Christmas, and I wear it everyday. It came fast and on time. There's nothing really else to say, it is beautiful and durable. Like others have said, when I wear it I always think about all the things Naruto stands for and it's messages...To try your best and never give up c"
1,I couldn't be happier with this purchase! Its a gift for my friend who introduced me to anime and who loves the hell out of Naruto so this was of course the go to gift! i know she will FREAK and Love it! Simply Flawless!
0,"I have a few necklaces from Miss Sixty, and the first two I ordered have more weight and appear to be better materials. This one looks a little cheap and may be better suited for tweens."
0,It turned a funny color and then broke in the middle ...Bad Choice ....
1,"The quality of this necklace was superb! I wear it with both pieces, and it looks really unique, not to mention better than anyone else's yin-yang necklace. Plus you can split in in half to share with someone else.Only down side is that if you want to share it you have to by two new necklace strings because of the make of the original string is leather, has no clasp, and has two knots in the back that you slip around to adjust the length.Love it though!"
0,I bought this just for me because I love necklaces. I thought that it would come just as it did in the picture and it didnt. It wasn't very good quality and the strings were very strange and annoyed me. I cut them apart beause I didn't like them apart it just looked bad. They looked much better in the picture then they did when they arrived. I've ordered from Dan's Jewelers before and was satisfied but not this time.
0,"I ordered this so me and my fiance could each wear one. I wanted it so whenever we wear it, we think of each other.Very fast delivery. I did standard shipping and it got here two days after I ordered.However, that's probably the only good thing about it.The part of the necklace that appears white (yin) is not white at all, but rather silver. Still cute, but I was expecting white. The metal was a bit rusted as well. Not too much, butn still noticable to anyone who looks closely. Lastly, the black material it came on was WAY too small for anyone to put around their neck. It doesn't have a place to latch in the back- it's simply a put over your head one. This is fine, but it's so small that I doubt it could even go over a Cabbage Patch's head.Overall, go ahead and get it if these things are fine with you. I kept mine simply because yin/yang friendship pieces are very rare and I'd been wanting one for both of us for a long time. I went out and got new chains to put them on. Definetly not worth the money I paid for the pieces and the new chains, but once again, I kept it because they're rare."
1,The item is exactly what my daughter wanted. She loves it! She gave half of it to her boyfriend. They love it!
1,"It's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost. It's not filmsy or cheap, it's durable and great."
0,"This is a clever little necklace idea, but the actual product arrives as two separate pendants. Each half is on its own cord, which is knotted quite sturdily. If you want to put the two halves together, you have to cut both necklace cords and then get a new cord to string them on. Very disappointing."
1,"This necklace comes on an adjustable necklace, which is kinda cool. But if you plan on sharing (bff kinda thing) you have to cut the necklace to get the pendant off. Not a big deal, it can be tied back together."
1,Bought these for my husband and I back when we were dating. Love them. We still wear them. They got kind of beat up looking after a while (we've had them 3 years now) but they're not hideous lol.
1,"everything was fantastic! it arrived early, looks exactly the same as the photo, no fake advertising, and the rope-chain-thing is great too, it extends, but if you want to give one half to another person, you have to cut the rope and buy two whole new chains. all in all, I'm VERY happy"
1,I gave this to my son and daughter in law for christmas and my son thought is was really great! I loved the response it got! Great gift for any couple!
1,"It was the only friendship ying yang necklace I could find anywhere. It was perfect, exactly what I envisioned. Fast shipping. Shipping was a bit expensive, though, considering the price of the item, but because the item itself was reasonably priced, I got over it. The other problem I had with shipping, and I don't know if it was the merchant, or Amazon, is that it indicated that the number of days for standard shipping would get it to me well before Christmas, but when I clicked on standard shipping it gave me a notice that I WOULDN'T get it before Christmas and I HAD to choose expedited in order to get it by Christmas. That did not make me happy."
0,The picture looks better than the charm it's self. I bought it for my cousin who is 34. He didnt seem to interested in it. My son who is 11 liked it. I would buy it for someone 15yrs. or younger.
0,"I have to say I'm kind of unimpressed. The picture that goes with this item is deceiving. When I bought the necklace I thought it was going to be black and white, but it was just silver. The lighting in the picture really makes it look black and white even though it really is silver and gray.If you want to buy this so you can share it with someone go for it; otherwise, I would look elsewhere for a Yin-Yang necklace."
1,"Exactly what I wanted, turned up in beautiful condition and was perfect. My boyfriend and I each have half and it helps us think of the other when we're apart. The cord it came on was small, but I cut if off and we put it on chains. Just not as pretty when you're stuck with one half and the other has disappeared, so be careful about who you split it with."
0,"I did not receive the chain that I ordered. The one that was shipped to me was another style entirely. When I sent an email to the company, they replied in an email telling me that I would have to have a specific form to return the chain, but that they were out of the forms and would send one later. Of course, I never heard from them again. I just gave up and used the chain they sent, even though it was not the one I ordered. There is nothing wrong with the chain - quality and design are fine - it just wasn't what I wanted."
1,"I bought two of these toe rings as Christmas gifts. Especially for the price, this is a quality item. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again."
0,when I purchased this item it was listed as genuine moonstone now it is listed as synthetic????????
0,"Its made with beautiful moonstones, although some are more translucent than others. And its stretchable, but its soo big that you'd never need to stretch it out. It won't fit on a wrist of regular width."
1,This is a very good quality silver chain. I wear it 24 hrs a day and it is not only pretty but comfortable. I get so many compliments on it.
0,"I bought for a friend whose birthday is in November. However, when I received the charm, her birthday did not fall in the dates indicated."
0,Bead size is smaller than 8mm. Took 2 months to get response from seller about how to return them.
1,I love this necklace its well made and i can use in may different ways. I often change my necklace pieces so i like that it has many uses.
1,"I have dealt with silver insanity before, and the quality and value of what you get is beyond compare. I ordered two of these chains and they work well with both small and large pendants. The high quality lobster claw fastener is way better than those open loop ones that you'd probably pay twice as much if bought from a private store. Would definitely buy again! Thank You Silver Insanity!"
1,"I recently sent for this necklace. The delivery was prompt,and the necklace exactly matched the photograph of it. I liked the small invoice, which said to me that the people from Silver Insanity are environmentally aware and careful. The black velvet pouch and small ziploc plastic bag it came in were nice touches; very elegant. The necklace looks great with the sapphire pendant I placed on it; the two look as though they were made to fit together. I would certainly send for any jewelry item from them again."
1,Bought this to put a small charm on for a friend bracket is much nicer in person seems sturdy and for the price it's perfect very pleased with my purchase
1,I was very pleased with this bracelet. It is well made and fits well. I especially like the link it has.
1,"I saw this necklace several years ago and when I went back to get it, it was gone. Finally decided to search for it online and found it! I absolutely live by this saying....E. Roosevelt was an incredible woman, especially considering the era she lived in.I have two issues with this necklace. One, I wish it came with a longer chain and Two, the lettering on the reverse side is not as strongly engraved...not bad, just not as bold as the other side. But, it did arrive when promised, and was well packaged."
1,Just what I wanted! Looks great and I will wear for every Irish event!
1,"The picture does not do it justice. My dear husband is very happy and always gets asked about where he got it. His answer ""My Wife""."
1,I like these comfortable and very durable rings. This is my second one and is due to my fingers swelling so I needed a larger size. I have had the first one about 3 years now.
0,I purchased the wrong size and had to exchange the ring. I expect to have the correct ring somtime soon...I hope.
0,I have to say that I am disappointed with this one. I now own about 6 Swarovski bracelets and this one is just as nice as the others but I bought it thinking it was a three/twisted bracelet. It comes as three separate bracelets and I suppose you can twist them together but I thought from the photo that they came that way. So I am giving them less stars in the rating just because it's 3 separate bracelets.
1,these were perfect for my cousins graduation present from LSU. They were really cute and the perfect size. She loved them and so did I. I will def order another pair for myself
1,These Earrings are the perfect gift for all my LSU fans! They are perfect for game day! I ordered them prior to last weeks game and they arrived prior to the game! Geaux Tigers!!!
0,"For the price these earrings are ok. I didn't completely understand the term ""coin"" pearl so I was surprised by the uneven surface. I'll know what to expect if I see the term again. Worth keeping at that price."
0,"Now, Im not one to give out 1 star to just anything. I have bought many items through Amazon since around 2000 or so, but this one earned every point. First of all, the sword was discolored when I recieved it. It appeared to have a light yellow color to it. Next, the chain was too short. Even if you have a pencil neck, this chain would probably strangle you. Next, the elegant case was a cheap piece of plastic. Needless to say, this one went into the trash a few days after I recieved it."
1,"This pendant isn't half as flimsy as other reviews make it out to be.On a nice chain, it looks great, though it is smaller than I imagined it would be."
1,I love these earrings! I had been searching for a YEAR for something to match a necklace that I already owned. These were PERFECT!
1,"I love this ring! My boyfriend got it for me for Christmas this year, and it is exactly my style. The ring is very delicate looking (much smaller than it looks in the photo) and the gem inside is very sparkly. I love the antique style sterling silver setting, it is perfect for vintage jewelry lovers."
1,"This amulet is pretty powerful. It is so powerful, you will feel the ""vibe"" instantly. It is also very pretty and strong feeling. Definately made for the ""long run"""
0,"I was happy to find this product at first but after receiving it in the mail, this thing sucks. For the price its a rip-off. The Charm itself is extra small, maybe a inch but the necklace and the ankh or both fake and fade over two week period. The necklace turned my neck green. The design is terrible. If this was 7-9.99 then maybe, but for $30. PLEASE DON'T GET THIS!"
0,Product is okay. The chain on the pendant broke shortly after the person received it and put it on. It would appear it was not that good.EGYPTIAN Cross Ankh Red Crystal Pendant Egypt Necklace
1,They were so nice it was difficult for me to give them away as gifts!DL
1,"I gave these cufflinks to my husband for Christmas, he loves them! They are well made, came quickly and in a gift box for the holidays. Very fun gift."
0,"Sorry, but this necklace looked much bigger in stone size, and larger on lenght in the picture shown. So I was a bit disappointed when it arrived!It certainly is more fitting for a teenager, I think."
1,I love this toe ring! It is adjustable but not bulky at all and keeps it simple. I like it a lot!
1,"I LOVE this toe ring. I'm always in the sand and at the beach every weekend, and I never take this toe ring off. It was a little big for me, so I twisted it around my toe to fit better. I get a lot of compliments on this toe ring--even with how small and simple it is. It never turned colors, rusted, or changed within the many months I had it.Would probably make a nice gift, too."
1,I love this toe ring because it is hearty and I keep it on my toe all year round. It doesn't rub in a strange way and allows me to wear it even when I am jogging. I want to eventually order another just the same for the other foot. Is a large gauge silver piece and not easily bent.
1,Very nice yet simple my kind of toe ring!!I like that I was able to track my package also very nicely put together package
1,This necklace is so elegant and can be worn both casual and formal.Great purchase at a great price.
1,My wife was exceptionally happy with this gift. No need to spend thousands on diamonds!
1,"These pearls are surprisingly well made for the price! A beautiful peachy-pink color, clasp easy to work. The only tiny problem I had was the clasp became undone just a teeny bit too easily. But overall, this is an amazing gift, or even purchased for yourself."
1,I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T PAY $100.00 OR MORE FOR THIS NECKLACE! IT LOOKS THAT GOOD!
0,"Got a tiger eye necklace instead of turquoise, and too late to return since shipped all the way to Lagos!"
0,the product arrived in perfect condition but the shipping is ridiculously slow. i will not order from them again.
0,"When I received this is the mail I was disappointed. It did not sparkle as my other Swarovksi pieces and the silver cheapens the look. I expected more crystals and less silver- unfortunately I did not get what was pictured. I even contacted the seller to see about returning it. The only reason I kept this over-priced piece was because I had also purchased the matching earrings and bracelet. The bracelet (the one with just crystals, no silver beads) is stunning and the earrings are decent."
1,This was the fourth piece of Swarovski jewelry bought for my wife. All have been beautiful and are loved. This is a great item to start or add to a collection of Swarovski Crystal jewelry. You can't go wrong with this necklace or vendor.
0,My husband bought a set of this jwelry for my birthday in June and I loved it! But today I found the silver chain turns into totally BLACK! I only weared them twice for my birthay and my friend's wedding and I kept them in their little boxes very well! Only two month they become so ugly! I am very upset and I never see any jwelry has such bad quality! The whole set costs us more than hundred dollars! Feel very very BAD!
0,The item I received is NOT the same as pictured. It looks and feel like plastic. I'm pretty sure it will fade because (and I'm not kidding) it reads 924 instead of 925!!! I almost can't believe it. I'm very dissapointed.
1,"I am very pleased with my purchase of this silver pentacle. It was just the right price, just the right size, and is very high quality. I got the cut-out kind because it can be seen better over clothes, and this certainly does that. A jumpring allows the cord to be put in so that the pentacle faces outward. I also like how the metal is nice and strong.The only problem I had with it was that there was no apparent indication that it came with a cord, and so silly me, I bought a cord at the same time, which wasted some money. That, and the cord could be a *little* bit longer. With my hair down, I can get the necklace over my head just fine; if I have ponytails or pigtails, it's a little difficult. And with a hat, I can forget about it. But that's my only complaint, and I'm going to give 5 stars because that complaint is more to do with my large head than with the length of the cord."
1,"I bought this as a promise ring for my girl friend and she liked it very much. The two diamonds look very good. The ring is simple but beautiful at the same time and for the price, it is a great buy indeed."
1,"My mom bought me this ring as a christmas present two years ago and I absolutely love it. It is very small, but it works out because it is discrete, and pops when you look at it. Mine is still shiny and looks brand new, so this ring wears very well. I am looking for a new ring for my other hand, but I wear this ring everyday. This ring is not only perfect for a girlfriend, but it's also perfect for a daughter."
1,"My dearest friend is going through a tough time and we live in different states. Although we talk on the phone, I was looking for a small, tangible something I could send to her - something she could open her dresser drawer and see each day. This bracelet filled that bill. The product picture is exactly what it looks like in the box; the presentation is great and that is what I wanted most. Great price and great sentiments I want her to remember. Perfect gift!"
1,"This was one of three bracelets I bought as gifts. Niceley packaged, with embellishments. A thoughtful gift for a friend."
1,"I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE TO HAVE ON HAND FOR BIRTHDAYS OR WHEN A SMALL GIFT IS NEEDED. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, HAVE A SMALL MESSAGE AND GIFT BOX. THEY ARE JUST SO FEMININE AND PRETTY. THEY CAME SO FAST I ALMOST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. THEY ARE CALLED EXPRESSLY YOURS. I LOVE THEM AND I HOPE WHEN I HAVE GIVEN ALL AWAY I WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MORE."
1,"Not long ago, a friend gave me a smoky topaz brooch. After receiving many compliments I decided to look for some pieces to give myself a complete set. When I found this emerald cut ring I thought it would be the perfect addition. I also ordered matching earrings14k Yellow Gold 7x5mm Emerald Cut Smoky Quartz Stud Earrings.The ring is perfect and the sizing is correct. It goes equally well with my winter and summer wardrobes. The size makes it perfect for daytime/work wear as it is big enough for notice without being too flashy. Since the color is not too dark, it can be worn well with a variety of colors and styles of clothing. I have been very happy with it and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile piece."
1,The ring is everything it was described as and more.the stone is just the right size for my hand size. Have had many compliments on the ring and it goes perfect with the necklace I have of the same stone
1,This bracelet makes a beautiful gift. Comes in a nice box ready to give. The words are inspiring and colors go with almost anything. Will have to buy another one soon.
1,"Got this for our two sisters who were graduating (one for college, one for highschool) and they are perfect little gifts. It's not ""Expensive jewelry"" so as mentioned before -- if someone wants something really expensive and suuper nice...not the way to go. But our sisters love jewelry of all sorts so it is perfect. Came in a lovely little gift box which were perfect to give away. Came promptly - total of 5 business days. Completely impressed! :)"
1,I gave this bracelet to my wife for graduation. She really likes it but one of the charms came loose a few weeks later. At least her wrist hasn't turned green.
0,This bracelet was a gift for my niece. I thought it was nice and motivating for someone who going through the start of adulthood. She really liked it and wears it often.
1,We gave this bracelet to my kids' teachers and they loved it. I saw the principal of our school and a few other teachers admiring it. The bracelet is sturdy and well constructed and to top it off its really pretty.
1,"I gave this gift to my little cousin as a middle school graduation gift and she loved it. Everything from the bracelet, to the card...even the box, was perfect. I will definitely try to use this seller again if I need another gift like this."
1,I will be ordering these bracelet's over and over again. They areso nice. They come in the perfect little gift box! Please keep themcoming in more choices. Thank you.
1,"My mother adored this little sentiment, beautiful and elegant. A definent buy, I am very very happy with the product"
1,"I've never seen this gift actually on my step mother, but she did say it was absolutely beautiful. She cried when she got it. The meaning of the bracelet is beautiful!"
0,the recipiant of this gift loved it just had a comment hoping they could make the clasp a little easier to fasten
1,"I purchased this looking for a great gift for my mother. The bracelet came in a beautiful purple tied box. This was the best looking gift under the christmas tree!! The bracelet also looked beautiful, however my mother is big boned and the bracelet is a little tight, but its a great gift! I love it."
1,"This was a good choice for my mother so I expect it would be perfect for anyone's mother. Be it a mother's day present, her birthday or just because you want to show you care, it was a good length on her, it wasn't loose to the point that it would slip past her wrist but just stay where it was. I highly recommend it! I just would like to say that I can't find anything that should be added... it's a great price for those stuck on options of what to get your mother. And now I'm just rambling so I'll stop..."
1,My mom loved this!! I got it for her on mothers day. I just purchased this item on the 8th of may and it was already shipped to my moms house on the 11th. i wasn't expecting it to be shipped so soon. i received a call from my mother crying with joy (keep in mind shes not a very sentimental person and very hard to shop for)... She described this as it came in a very beautiful box and the poem inside the box was what made her cry lol. She asked how much i had payed for it and when i told her she was expecting it to be more because of how well made the bracelet is and the quality of everything in general. It was definitely worth the money! I would recommended this a gift for all the mothers!
1,Bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it. nice quality nice price and my mom enjoyed it. Also delivered super fast. So if you need a gift fast and you like this than this is the one you should buy!10/10
0,its a very nice product i got for my mom and she loved itwow so yea i reccomend good luck
1,I am giving this to my daughter...she is a good mother...and i just want to let her know that. Arrived in perfect condition and as always fast shipping...thanks
1,"Mom loves it, I am sooooooo happy about my purchase... I will love my mother forever, no matter what, and this is a small way to show it!"
1,Very worth the price to give this as a gift for a loved one. My mother loved this product and says it was beautiful. If your looking for a good product I reccommend this.
1,"This is a really nice ring. It has a nice shine to it. Feels comfortable when wearing. Different but not flashy, a break from the ordinary wedding band."
0,"These earrings are very cute, but very small and thin. They are hard to remove from your ears without bending the earrings. I don't think they will last long before they break. If they were a little larger and move durable, they would be perfect."
1,I purchased this bracelet as a gift - it is beautiful!! The young lady that received it loved it and wears if often. Great price!!
1,"this is a very pretty necklace and if like me you like garnets and silver, this is a must have. It was reasonably priced and delivery was was very good as I live in the UK."
0,"I purchased this bracelet from Ross-Simons before seeing it here. It's a pretty bracelet, however, the clasp was flawed, and broke. When I contacted Ross-Simons about the clasp, they said they'd exchange the bracelet. Seemed reasonable, as the bracelet is nice and all I wanted to know is if they stood behind the product. I sent the bracelet in, and *surprize* got a check in the mail. In subsequent contacts with them, they said the bracelet was out-of-stock. These contacts have been very unsatisfactory, no bracelet was &quot;exchanged&quot;, and I am out shipping costs."
1,"I absolutely love Blue Topaz...whether its earrings, bracelets or necklaces. I was devastated when I lost one of my previous pairs of blue topaz earrings, so when I saw these on Amazon, I had to have them....love them, love them, love them."
1,This bracelet is beautiful! I wear it all the time! High quality Brighton jewelry that looks expensive but is really reasonable.
0,"They have a nice sparkle for a ring of this price. That said, I find that the ring bends/flexes too easily, I am definitely afraid it will fall off at some point."
1,"I've bought jewelry before, but never a ring and never from an online retailer, so I was a bit leery of purchasing right away; I took my time looking at all the different styles and finally settled on this (the journey diamond ring). Amazon's collection truly had the most versatile selection all set to a price that won't break your budget. I strongly recommend purchasing from them, you couldn't ask for better quality even from a professional jeweler."
1,I was originally shopping around at the jewelery store with my fianc&eacute;e and wasn't happy with the prices. They wanted between $700 and $800 for the same exact thing. GEM AVENUE only wanted half the price. I appreciate the business and will keep in mind for future presents. Thank You very much
1,"The ring is really, really pretty and I would have kept it if it would have fit, but, it was sized small so I am returning it. Shipping and packaging were great and on time.In the meantime, I found a different ring that looks exactly like my wedding ring that I had lost but never told my husband that I lost it, so I'm ordering it!"
1,"Beautiful antique looking ring. The jade pieces are a nice olive green color, and well matched. Really elegant look for a great price. Comfortable enought to wear every day. Love Palm Beach Jewelry. Will buy from this company again,"
1,the ring is a nice size. has three good size jade stones.It looks nice on the hand too.
1,I really like the ring. It is the size I ordered and looks like the picture.
1,Very pretty ring. Very classic looking. Gold is a bit to yellow for me thus looking a bit fake but it is so can't really complain to much. The stones are beautiful and looks great on.
1,Happily surprised to find this great ring at such a low price. Will definitely shop this vendor again.
1,I bought this as a birthday present. Opened it to see it before I gave it and it is absolutist beautiful!
1,I wear these beautiful rings almost everyday. They are just enough of a touch of diamonds. They sparkle and the combination of the three different colors are great.
0,Very pretty ring but stone fell.out three days after getting it other than that the ring was very lovely wish I could get another one but scare it will happen again
0,"I bought this ring for myself, I wasn't expecting anything glamorous but i was expecting something better. the stone looks like cheap plastic and was loose when it arrived and fell out a week later. the metal is thin and chips easily. i was not impressed with this ring at all. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone over seven years old."
1,I bought the ring for my best friend and got myself the cubic zirconia one & they look so good!the rock kinda big but it's supposed to be like that & it's a good price. very satisfied with the purchase :)
1,Very cool for any car guy...Purchased these for a Father's Day present. Can't wait for him to open!! Nice quality.
0,The earrings are minute! I didn't realize they were that tiny! I would have preferred a little bigger. I thought they would be as big as the picture shown.
1,"My husband is a soldier in the Army and when he's not working he's not suppose to wear his dog tags and so I bought him this to help him feel like he's still wearing dog tags and he loves it! He's been a Pirates fan for almost his entire life so me being able to buy him this for the low price, was amazing! It's a great value and it's lasted a long time!"
1,This ring is true to size and is really well made. The mother of pearl is a good quality and the stone stands a little higher than the silver. It is a great value for the price!
0,"The cleaning cloth was much smaller than I was anticipating - when comparing to those sold by other companies. It does, however, do a good job cleaning silver so it does what it is supposed to do."
0,These earrings made me very unhappy when they arrived in the mail. I bought them for my wife as a christmas gift and I couldn't bear the thought of giving them to her. I was very disappointed by the discoloring of the diamonds!
1,They are very small no doubts about it.They are also very beautiful and we are very pleased.Hope you guys enjoy as much! Happy Shopping to everyone out there !!!
0,"What i got is really bad service and bad quality. The product quality that I got is much different from what shown in the picture. Second thing is, I bought a pair of this and each of them are in different size. One is smaller than the other. I planned to give this as a gift. But after such a long wait and by seeing this, feel so upset about it."
0,"My dear husband bought me these diamond earrings for xmas to replace one from a set that he'd bought me a few years ago that I'd lost. He's usually a very savvy consumer so I'm shocked he would buy diamonds off the internet. They're not terrible, and if you're one of those guys who just want to buy ""any old"" diamonds for your girl, they'll probably work. But diamonds are really something that should be purchased in person where you can inspect them yourself for clarity & quality. The ones I got were a little cloudy and unimpressive. But I kept them because I didn't want to hurt my husbands feelings. BUT...PLEASE, gentelmen, go to a jewelry store and look at the diamonds if you're buying them for a lady!"
0,"Much smaller than I anticipated (I should have read the description more carefully). Also, less substantial and less detailed than expected. Pretty but not really worth the price ($45)"
1,"Quality is so good, and I'm so proud to wear this item. Have looked for a long time for an affordable abalone bracelet and this fit the bill."
1,I bought this pendant for my 14 year old daughter. She loved it. It's sparkles just right without being overbearing. It's dainty yet makes a bold statement. Both my daughter and I are satisfied with the purchase.
0,"The ring they sent me was similar, but still very different than the ring in this picture. Also, the diamonds were very yellow... I'd even say that some of them were BROWNISH. I've never actually seen such yellow diamonds. Every single baguette had large visible flaws. I would rather wear a $5 CZ ring (or no ring at all) than wear this one."
0,"I got the belly button ring for myself, which is very cute, but it didn't last only but about 2 weeks (maybe less)when the bottom part of it that dangles, fell off. The bottom part is the only thing that makes it a playboy bunny item, and now it's just a regular belly button ring. Cute, but cheap."
1,"I made a last-minute decision to get this and ordered with expidited shiping. They promised delivery on December 24, and I recieved the ring on Dec. 23.My wife is a nurse and can't wear her diamond wedding ring to work, but likes to have a band. She lost the band I got her on our 1st Christmas when we moved to our new house. So, I was hoping that this ring would look nice.My wife was more than happy with the looks. It is simple but pretty, and we are very happy with the purchase."
1,"Very nice ring, not dissapointed at all. I get a lot of compliments, and it fit to size, I wear on my middle finger on my right hand."
1,I will be using this box to propose to my girl friend this weekend.. Much smaller than I thought but perfect size to fit in my pocket and makes the ring look bigger ;)
1,"Perfect style for giving/selling either new or vintage rings. Very elegant. Recommended.Only issue is shipping is a bit high. Still a good product, especially if there is nothing locally available that is suitable."
0,This product is horrible! I opened and closed one box 2 times and it broke and the other one would not snap back shut! So unsatisfied!
0,"We have been using these boxes for a few days, one is holding up fine, but the other is already difficult to close and feels as if it is going to break."
1,I ordered this piece and am very happy I did. I get nothing but compliments when I wear it. Thanks.
0,"Full of plastic-looking plastic beads! Granted the necklace is cheap, but the plastic spacers spoil an otherwise nice piece of jewelry."
1,"I appreciate this necklace and the company I ordered it from. It expresses the beauty of green so well that I'd like to know who designed it. The necklace indeed got its character. It's a piece of art, I'd like to say."
1,"This is a lovely piece of jewelry. I was very happy with the product, the packaging (a nice satin draw string bag) and the shiping/delivery time.I would buy from this vendor again for sure."
1,"I chose this ring over a couple of other two-tone Celtic bands available, my love gave it to me for our handfasting. It's exactly the measurements described, but looks and feels a little bigger in-person than estimating the 6mm width with a ruler. Has a good weight, stamped inside, ""Novell 14 K HANDMADE."" Beyond that, it's beautiful. The yellow gold really glows against the white gold edges. A little bigger than the average ""lady's ring,"" it could work for a lady or a gent."
1,"I purchased this choker a while back for my wife. and she wears it almost every day. My wife says it is so easy to change out pendants. They just slide on and off. This is solid sterling, so it polishes very nicely with a polishing cloth. The box it comes in is very nice too! It is metal covered with velvet. She stores other jewelry in it. 2 for one! cool! When mama's happy, everybody's happy!"
0,"I actually bought it form my mother in law, who has a bit of a thicker neck. It looked awful on her, so I decided to keep it and was not happy with it at all."
1,I have a collar from Lia Sophia that I love but I have sensitive skin and I can't wear it in the summer. This collar is a little wider than I imagined but it looks really good!
0,"What I liked about this pair of earrings is the light-weight. Due to the nature of corals, the individual pieces vary in color, texture, and size. The jeweler made a good attempt to piece together corals to ensure homogeneity for each pair of earrings. I ordered my first pair and realized that there was a very noticeable dark spot on one of the coral pieces. So I ordered another set. This set did not have any dark spots, but the coloring was not as deep as the first set. Therefore, I ended up returning both pairs because I felt like I did not receive the great value for the price like I usually do from Amazon."
1,the bracelet is better than i thought it would be. the seller provided excellent customer service. i was contacted right away by an actual human on the phone when i emailed about upgrading my shipping because of an important deadline. i would buy from this seller again.
1,"I got these trays, not for watch display, but for displaying my crafts in the showcase. It gives me a nice background, has that nice felt-like material to keep my items save and with the compartments, I can tilt it without things falling all over the place. Then I decided to use it for my own collections like seashells and it makes my collection more beautiful. I liked the sturdiness of the trays and I had 5 to use which really helped with savings. I think anyone could benefit from these great trays. (oh yea pocket watches too...LOL)A great buy, great product, and a fast shipper"
0,"I thought this was really cute, but then it broke the first time I wore it (it may have somethin gto do with my baby grabing it, but I don't think he had a chance to pull very hard). Not very happy. For some reason I can't change the star rating, but I'd give it one start now."
0,"These earrings are cute. They almost look cheap, but seem to be well made. I haven't actually worn them yet, so I will update if anything changes."
1,Enchanting excellent way to describe. Crystal just glows. Light weight. Easy to put in and stays in place.
1,"The picture does not do these earrings justice. Very elegant but simple enough, light weight but they remain in place. Highly recommended product and seller."
1,"These are very pretty earrings. They area little heavier than I like my earrings but not awful. They are larger than they look in the picture and, since I'm not good with metric, didn't realize how large. But, I am pleased and will wear them."
1,"These are very pretty, only draw back is they don't stay in place, the chain is ultra thin so they slip easily."
0,"This roll was smaller than I thought it would be. It is of decent construction, but considering the price, I think it could have been made out of better, higher quality materials."
0,Today I went to Zales and randomly I decided to let them check if this ring is real diamonds or not. The result is shocking
1,"My nephew, whom I purchased this for, loved it. He wears it every day."
1,"My daughter's ears are super sensitive. These are the only earrings she is able to wear, with out breaking out. She has tried everything. I try to tell everyone about these. They are awesome!"
0,"The funny thing with me is that I can wear almost anything in the first holes in my earlobes, which I got at least thirty-five years ago as a young child. I react to every earring I use in the holes in my cartilage"
1,"These were the best earrings--my daughter developed a reaction to her peiced earrings just after getting them done we tried everything even plastic earrings. These are the best. I was able to put them in and within a few days the puss from her ears went away and she is now able to have ""pierced ears."" I also love the ""medical titanium"" ones even better. If you have sensitive allergic reactions to metals definately give these a try."
1,"I love these earrings. I have bought multiple pairs from Blomdahl. My little girl looks so pretty in them. I began using them after my pediatrician recommended them when piercing my daughter's ears. She has never had a reaction to them. She has been able to pull the backs off of them and we have lost a couple pairs, but I'd still buy them. I bought a couple pairs for my neice who has a terrible nickel allergy and she has never had a reaction to these earrings. I highly recommend these earrings. I didn't realize it, but a nickel allergy is usually developed during the first year after getting your ears pierced. If you stay away from all sources of nickel (i.e. Use medical grade plastics) during that initial first year, the chances of developing a nickel allergy are very slim...."
0,The picture is so beautiful but it is also very magnified. These earrings are thin and flimzy. Would not buy again.
1,This lion is perfect for my Twilight bracelet. It's so detailed compared to all of the others that I compared it to. Thanks!
1,I purchased this Lion charm for my daughter's Twilight charm bracelet and it is the most attractive Lion charm I have found. Precious Accents is also a pleasure to deal with and you can't beat the free shipping.
1,"I have worn these for 48 hours straight with no swelling, irritation, weeping, infection or pain. THANK YOU for finally allowing me to wear earrings longer than 2 hours without pain."
1,My order was received quickly and packaged very well. My daughter absolutely loves these earrings. She cannot wear metal earrings due to allergies. Wearing these earrings have allowed her ears to heal and they look great. The backs stay on well. My only complaint is that they are a little pricey for plastic.
1,"These Blomdahl plastic earrings are the only earrings my daughters can wear; anything else (even surgical titanium) causes a reaction. If these earrings didn't exist, my kids wouldn't have earrings."
1,This ring is certainly worth the price. It is a wonderful addition to my collection. A good buy.
0,"After about one year, the tie clip snapped right at the connecting springleaf. I think I paid almost $40.00 for this clip. So I went back to my mainstay tie clip that I've owned for more than a decade, that cost me less than $4.00 at military clothing sales when I was on active duty."
1,THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY TO DEAL WITH.VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SATISFIED. I'LL BE BACK AGAIN !
1,"Excellent craftmanship, lovely piece, received within a few days of ordering it in a box suitable for gifting."
0,"my boyfriend ordered this ring as my main christmas present a week or so before the 25th. On CHRISTMAS EVE you sent a cancellation email. I don't know what happened, but you need to rectify this situation big time. What a horrible thing for you to do on christmas!"
1,Rembrandt charms are very high quality with excellent detail. Also huge selection. I purchased a number of gold plated silver animal charms for a friend and she is pleased with all of them. Highly recommend.
1,"I'm a simple girl, I don't like flashy jewelry so this was perfect for me. It's durable and it's one of the few earrings that I haven't managed to lose yet."
1,These are the most comfortable earrings I own and I have received many compliments on them.
1,"Works wonderfully with my sonic jewelry cleanter. I wouln't want to be without one, ever!"
0,"Although the fault is not Amazon's,the product which was ordered and paid for was never delivered to the designated recipient."
1,I don't leave the house with dirty jewelry. And I needed the bulk gallon because I was using up the 8 oz stuff too quickly. This stuff works great.
1,"My daughter's ears became irritated due to a metal allergy. I learned about the allergy free properties of Titanium earrings and bought the 4mm pearls. The irritation cleared up and she's able to wear earrings again. I am planning to order the plastic post ones for her, too."
1,These are exactly what I was looking for. The description and picture matched exactly what I needed and I can't take them off! Would definitely recommend.
1,"This ring is as cute as it looks in the picture. As a new cat owner, I enjoy having this to wear as a subtle reminder that I own cats. It is a little less quality than I thought it would be -- the ring is thin, but for the price, it's great."
1,"This ring is really cute. It isn't very bold, but more of a subtle look. It fits true to size. I really enjoy wearing it."
1,I bought this ring for my daughter's birthday; my daughter just loves it and all of her friends comment on how great looking it is; this is a very unique high quality ring. Silver Insanity provides great service and expeditious delivery to its customers.
1,The rings come in faster then expected. They are even better looking in person then on the site...Totally love them THANKS SO MUCH!!
1,My husband and I couldn't decide what to get each other for Christmas. I found this ring and we both thought it would make the perfect gift. We each have one and they are the most comfortable rings. His wedding band is a comfort fit so he was familiar with the way this ring fits. I have never had anything with a comfort fit band so it took a little getting used to but I just love the way it fits. The band is so smooth! I was very pleased with how easy it was to communicate with the people at Silver Insanity. They responded promptly to my emails and answered all my questions. I will glady buy from them again.
1,"This is a very nice mens ring. Comfortable and sturdy, yet very stylish. My husband loved it."
1,I would definitely buy this again. it was exactly what i was looking for. except i hate theses rating surveys
1,"Anyone who has jewelry needs to have this Blitz Jewelry Care Cloth within reach! I could not believe the difference it made when I first used it. The cleaning cloth and buffing cloth are one of a kind. This cloth provides a quick and easy clean, leaving your jewelry looking like it was just cleaned by a professional. I highly recommend this cloth."
1,"My husband and I were thrilled with this product. It arrived very quickly and is beautiful. It's not very heavy, which is something my husband really enjoys and is a nice bright color."
1,I bought this ring for my old prom date it's a beautiful ring and fair price so any guy looking to save money until he afford that Engagement ring definitely get this.
1,Very nice bracelet. Beads are strung together on plastic strings so I'm sure you have to be careful not to pull on the beads too much. I was very happy with the way it looked. We received it super fast--which is good because the shipping was only $1 less than the item.
1,"This pendant is beautiful; it looks blue-purple in the picture, but it is very, very purple. Think of your purple Crayola crayon! The color saturation is deep enough that it can be worn with almost any color and not ""disappear"" against your shirt/blouse/sweater like the pale pink one does. I love that the jump ring is sterling, not that silver-plated base metal garbage. It does tend to get dirty quickly, but I've noticed that if I take a sponge or face cloth with just a tiny dab of dishwashing liquid and give it gentle rub all over under running water, it looks brand-new and sparkles again."
1,Item is just as advertised. Shipping is quick and packaging is very good. I was so impressed that I bought an additional pair of earrings from Augustina Jewelry
1,The Hamsa was just like I expected. I had already ordered one before and the service was just as great. The delivery was very fast. Thank you so much.
1,"I previously purchased a pair of diamond studs from Amazon that were a substantially inferior quality and were also about half this carat weight and returned those. I mistakenly thought that this size would be large enough for me, based on that previous purchase. I am currently staring at them wondering if I can bring myself to return them. They are not as big as I would like, but they are absolutely beautiful. They are packaged in a pretty wooden box, which itself was in a well-lined cardboard box to protect the ""real"" box. So all around, this is a nice product. However, make sure you know you want a .33 carat weight when you buy it - cause you're going to really want to keep them, even if it isn't the ""right size.""Update"
0,"This set is beautiful when it first arrives, but the finish on the silver wears off so quickly! Not even professional cleaning could get the shine back. One of the stones has fallen out of the wedding band, and I had only worn it twice. I really wanted this to last, because the rings are so pretty! It's just too bad it didn't work out. :("
0,It's pretty but the chain is really thin. My mom is afraid to wear and break it.
1,Super fast shipping. Arrived three days after order using standard. Product in perfect condition. Highly recommended seller!!!
0,"It is stiff and kinks very easily, and once it kinks, you cannot get the kink out, so pendents hang lopsided on it. Don't buy this."
1,I bought this omega to go with a pendant that I bought for my Bridesmaids. It is exactly what I wanted!
1,I purchased this to hold a wiccan protection knot pendant. My daughter loves silver and this is very strong as well as pretty.
1,"When I wear my boots I get a lot of complements. I wear them on the non-zipper side. I love them. Good product, good service. Mailed perfect. Would buy from seller again. I'm happy. Love those Cherry's."
1,Just what I needed for my piercings....When you piercing is irritated and itchy this is the right product to use
1,"I love the workmanship in this piece. Nicely done, and Silver Insanity has Awesome customer service."
1,"The cross is so much better than I expected. I love it! The price was right, and shipping was fast."
1,"Ross Simmons carries a much pricier line of jewelry than these little pearl earrings but they could pass for the more expensive ones! Comes in a nice little box inside a velvet bag. Very tasteful, great quality! Good company!"
1,My mom really loved this bracelet - she says it makes rainbows all over the house.
1,This bracelet sparkles and looks beautiful. I plan on wearing it to my daughter's wedding with the earrings and bracelet.
1,"I'm very pleased with this item. It is as described, very good quality and workmanship. The stone has a rich color and is securely set. The pattern is even and well proportioned. The silver is highly polished, heavy,and yet delicate in appearance."
0,"10k White or Yellow Gold Journey Circle Pendant (1/4 cttw, H-I Color, I3 Clarity)Very poor workmanship, necklace is only 16 inches, shorter than the description, and it is a very small circle. I was disappointed and returned it to Amazon."
1,Beautiful ring. Fast shipping. Ring fits perfectly and the setting is tight and well made. Ring is tastefully decorated with two diamonds next to center stone. Band is elegantly fashioned with scroll work. Timeless beauty. Thank you.
0,"I love that this ring matches my great grandmother's antique garnet bracelet but one drawback is that the metal work, while gorgeous, is two toned. I don't know how to describe it. Halfway through the detailed part of the band it has bright silver work and then it has the silver metal work with a blackened background. I wish that all of the metalwork had the blackened background because it looks more antique that way and it matches my bracelet. In the picture all of the metalwork is the same, if it looked like the picture i would be so happy."
1,"My daughter will love this ring, she had her 1st child last Jan, and wanted a ring with her daughters birthstone, this is delicate and classy and I can't wait till Christmas to give it to her. Excellant delivery time too."
0,my wife put on and five minutes later the area near the latch was broken.
1,great product and fast service. would def order from them again. we wanted inexpensive rings that look plain but nice for everyday wear. very pleased with the ring.
1,This Ring is beautiful. It fits perfect. The Price is Unbeatable. This Ring is really more then I expected.I will definitely from Bling Jewelry again.
1,I alwasy thought a ring on the thumb would be binding. But this one is perfect. You don't even know it's there.
1,I loved the product and the shipping time was a lot less than expected. No complaints at all!
1,The Stirling Silver Om Absolute Hindu Symbol Yoga bracelet I received as a gift for Mother's Day is just lovely. It sparkles on my wrist. The bracelet was sent promptly and was received in good condition. I would recommend this company.
1,"I love pins and the uniqueness of this one is perfect. A true eye-catcher. On the collar, draped across the shoulder or fastening a scarf. A worth-while piece to be proud of in your collection."
1,i am giving it as a gift and they will love it. it will be add to teens jewerly box
1,"I love this pin. It is very pretty and a nice size. I wish it didnt cost so much but it is very nice, cant wait to wear it!"
1,It was sized as requested (it is an unusual size) and the gem was perfect. My wife loves the ring.
0,"The stones are not very sparkly. A bit cloudy. But stylish, good for everyday wear and not for fancy outing. Still a good purchase for something simple."
1,"This is a wonderful, unique italian charm of Vincent van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" painting. Really great color and detail. Great price, quality, shipping costs, and delivery."
1,I was so pleasently surprised when I got this ring. It's beautiful. I would love to see it with a yellow or white stone. It's very heavy and everyone likes the way it looks. I've gotten many compliments. Thank you.
0,"I fell in love with this set the minute I saw it, so I bought it immediately. I wore it for about a week and the large center stone fell out. Down the shower drain!! Needs to be faceted stronger!!! While I'm a little disapointed, the company has responded quickly and super friendly and is replacing it immediately."
1,"I purchased these for a gift, and was tempted to keep them for myself. They are very pretty and well made, and the stones are especially nice. They are smallish earrings, but the quality is there and they are a good value and beautiful gift for yourself or someone else. Nicely packaged for gifting.I would love to get these myself."
1,This is a very beautiful ring. The color and quality of the ring is fantastic. Enjoy this ring very much.
1,"Beautifully crafted, and very unusual. Heavy piece so that you don't have to worry about it bending or breaking."
1,"I really liked the quality of the ring, and it fit perfectly on my husband."
1,"The locket is actually more beautiful in person. It has a nice heft to it without being too heavy. The hinge and clasp of the locket are well made. I feel confident storing a small special item within it. Over all it is a really nice piece of jewelry. It's unique and celebrates Celtic heritage in a not so vanilla fashion.I was really impressed at how quickly I received the locket, especially considering that it was shipped via USPS. I ordered it Tuesday evening and received it Thursday afternoon."
1,This bangle is great...much easier than a traditional chain charm bracelet for creating your own charm bracelet. I highly recommend it.
0,"First the order was late in being delivered. After a few months the ""white gold"" plating began to chip away..."
1,"This ring has good size, the stones are smaller than I imagined seeing the photo, but it is a good choice. Encanata me my ring, I love it."
1,It took to long to get and we thought we were never going to see the item but the company did stand behind it an did local the lost pendant
1,"Love this piece! It was a bit larger than I had expected (Amazon, please publish dimensions!!) but it's really pretty. The quartz stone is a bit cloudy...but hey, it's a stone. Great price, and looks great dressed up or casual."
1,"My daughter loves this bracelet, it is intricately designed and is beautifully finished. Well shipped by supplier."
0,"The clasp gets caught on your clothes and opens up so you can lose the pill inside. Good news is, it is a nice looking bracelet. I have received many compliments on it however I did want to keep a pill in it. That is why I purchased such a piece."
0,I only had it about a month and had not even used it and the chain broke off. I was sad it was beautiful but...
1,"The sizing of the ring is a perfect fit. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the ring does look better than its picture; it's shinier. Definitely recommended."
1,"Very good size (not too big, not too small), very comfortable fit, and great quality. Very satisfied with this purchase!"
1,"i got this pendant and he is just beautiful. i named him thorn after the dragon in christopher paolinis book, Eldest. i never leave the house without him. he is good luck and a beautiful piece of jewelery."
1,"This pair of earrings is absolutely beautiful! I was going to give them as a gift, but I am keeping them for myself! I will definately order from Silver Insanity again!My order came so fast and when I opened them up I was thrilled. Thank you.Colleen K."
1,I ordered 4 of these rings they were so very noticed and so elegantly simple. They arrived right away. Each was was as beautiful as the one before.
1,"I just received this today for my 37th anniversary gift. After that many years, I'm allowed to order what I want- so I knew I would LOVE it!!! Amazon did a great job of tracking the delivery of my order. I knew it should arrive today, but hadn't. I tracked it around 2pm and it stated that a delivery attempt was made at 12:57 and no one was available to sign for it, and another attempt would be made tomorrow. I was mad, as we're leaving out of town tomorrow, and I wanted to wear my anniversary gift! I printed out the tracking memo, and found the dumby UPS guy within minutes, and got my beautiful pendent! It's soooooo adorable. I have a number of pendents which I interchange with a very thich chain after having to have a thin one soldered too many times. The pendent would not fit on the thick gold chain. I went to the local jeweler to make it work. He tried, but couldn't, as my chain was too thick, and it wouldn't lay correctly if it was altered. Fortunately, I still had my old thin gold chain, and it fit perfectly. Thanks Amazon, you have a very happy customer! You give a good quality product for a good price, and back it up with quality service. Love, love, love my diamond and gold martini necklace. It's much cuter than the one I saw at [...], and the price was much better. Cheers!!! Carolyn"
1,"Many times with jewelry, what you see on the internet screen is nothing like what it looks like when you receive the item. This is not the case with this ring. It is beautiful and very shiny. The topaz is a nice size and the white gold is generous, not thin like on some lower-cost rings. Great deal!"
1,"I bought this product from Oximeter Superstore for a discounted rate in comparison to the MSRP the company demands, but I was under the impression that I was buying a ""first"" quality pendant that ended up being a ""second"" blemished pendant. I expected that I was getting a deal on a brushed finish sterling silver Q-link pebble pendant, and what was shipped to me was a polished sterling silver Q-link pendant that has a noticeable blemish in the form of a hole or casting bubble on the flat side that displays the copper coil. The art behind the coil that takes the shape of a target bull's-eye is off center enough to degrade the aesthetic appeal of its inner symmetry. On the other side, I contacted Oximeter Superstore concerning their blunder, and I got a response stating that I could pay to ship it back and pay a fee for restocking. This was an unacceptable answer! I would reasonable expect that Oximeter would offer to pay for shipping back, and offer to make it right by sending me an unblemished ""first"" quality product that boasts a brushed finish with the proper symmetrical expectations like the picture they used to sell this item. What a disappointment. I have had no other responses from them after I asked them to exchange this inferior product with the quality they stated in their Amazon sales page. Don't buy from these mean little people."
0,"I bought this because I love tourmaline and it's healing properties. Unfortunately the beads seemed to be put together in no kind of asthetically pleasing order. In the picture the colors fade and blend beautifully. I understand that the stones will not be exactly like the picture, but they could've at least blended it a lot nicer. I was half tempted to take it apart and put it back together so it looked better, but for this price I shouldn't have to. Also, the one milagro I got with it was pretty cheap looking with metal sticking out where it shouldn't be. I was very disappointed. I sent it back for a refund."
0,I can sum this up in one sentence
1,Well designed and finished. Slightly smaller than I thought it would be but she loves it...and that is all that counts.
0,"Please do not believe their claim that this cross is 1"" tall. That is an outright lie. I bought this cross because of the size and I was shocked when I opened the package. It's only about half as big as they claim. This is a very small child's piece of jewelry. The cross is about the size of penny. The chain is also very thin and cheap. I don't expect it would last a day before breaking. You can't even use a different chain because it passes through a very small hole in the body of the cross. Please do not buy this item unless you're prepared to use a magnifying glass to look at it. I bought this for my wife, but I have to return it because she's an adult!I've never experienced such a deceptive description of a product online before. I would be embarrassed to give this to my wife. I'm giving this necklace 2 stars because although it's minuscule, it is absolutely beautiful. If you are looking for very tiny jewelry, this piece is great. If you're looking for a gift for an adult, please keep looking. You'll just be wasting your time and money."
1,Excellent quality and perfect for the needs I have.Fast shipment and pretty presentation box.Well made and will meet your expectations.
0,"I gave this to my daughter for her birthday. The very first day she wore it, the hinge broke. I understand that the locket is inexpensive and lightweight, but that is no excuse for it being so poorly made."
1,"the previous review said it right when she said it was ""dainty and dramatic."" The color is beautiful, exactly what I hoped it would be.Also, I've read that Adventurine is considered to have healing properties,and some call it a ""Healer of the Heart and the Soul."" (if you believe in such things;) Can't hurt, right?"
1,Once I received the item it was priceless. Easy to assembly only top to attach to the side drawer piece & the legs to bench & unit plus the mirror and it was doneOnly don't expect the Estes shipping company not to play football with package and take forever to get it too you because it's Columbus Location doesn't know how to ship properly to it's Ft Wayne location
0,Received item within a week. great. On the other hand was so dissapointed in the color I received. I thought I had ordered the Oak in the photo which is printed on the invoice and in the photo to be a lighter color. That is not what I received. I received the vanity in what looks like a cherry-walnut color stain. My husband had put it together when I was at work otherwise it would have went back. does not match the furniture in the room. Overall it is a nice vanity. Dissapointed in the color.
1,"After a long search, my wife decided on this one as her laptop desk/vanity for the bedroom. We ordered from amazon after inspecting one that was fully assembled in a local store, so we already knew we liked the color and the style. We didn't attach the mirror because she wants to see out the window when she uses the laptop. Without the mirror there are 4 smoothly machined and nicely stained 3/8"" holes over a sixteen inch span along the top at the back. The laptop pretty well hides the holes so you'd hardly notice, and I'm pretty sure we'll find something nice looking to plug them with. Meanwhile, she's happy, so I'm happy.OK, a second caveat, besides the holes. Check and recheck the price plus shipping. It seems to swing back and forth about a hundred dollars every day or so."
1,"Not only did the ring arrive several days BEFORE estimated delivery date (free shipping! Since when is free shipping quick?), but it also arrived in style. The adorable little gift box was safely sealed in bubble wrap, and not a corner was bent or dented. The ring itself is very comfortable. The band is dainty, but not flimsy or thin. The sterling silver is perfectly even and smooth. The cz is larger than I expected, with excellent clarity. I was worried that it might be too obviously fake (I need a durable ring that can take a beating for work, but what's the point if it looks like it came out of a gumball machine?), but the stone is absolutely brilliant. It sparkles and shines and looks very elegant on the hand. I wanted a sterling silver ring because I wash my hands constantly through the work day (and at home), and I HATE having to remove my rings every time I get my hands wet. I have many sterling silver pieces of jewelry and not one of them has tarnished from soap/water, so here's hoping that my little ring stays beautiful! Will update after a few weeks of hard-labor ;) As for now, however, I am extremely happy with my purchase and am planning to purchase from Peora again and again.*****UPDATE*****Ok, so I have lots of sterling silver pieces that I have been very hard on over the years. Specifically, I have two bangle bracelets and a ring that I have not taken off (not in the shower, pool, hot tub, not at work, not for sleeping) once in 5 years and neither of them has tarnished or ever irritated me one bit. I loved this ring from Peora, but realized after about two weeks that I could not be sleeping with it on because I was having an allergic reaction. Also, after a couple more weeks, I realized that washing my hands with it on was causing a finish to wear off of the back of the ring. This leads me to believe that there is some kind of plating, possibly rhodium, on the ring (typically used to make the ring look more like white gold and to hide imperfections). I am very upset by this because I LOVE everything else about the ring, but it is just not what I was hoping for. I have never had this kind of reaction/issue with any other piece of sterling silver jewelry, no matter how much abuse it takes, so I am disappointed. If you don't mind taking your ring off every time you wash your hands and you don't sleep with rings on, you shouldn't have an issue with this ring and it will probably last you a long time. It is even more gorgeous in real life than in the picture. But if you're like me, and want the convenience of sterling silver versus the side effects of wearing costume jewelry, it is probably not for you. When I purchased this ring, I checked specifically to make sure it was not listed as having any kind of plating. As I am now sure that it does, perhaps Peora should list the plating in the product description. It really is a beautiful ring, especially for the price, and I have gotten many compliments on it. Unfortunately, it only lasted for about a month or two. What a shame, I now have to buy something else!"
1,"This ring is lovely. It is a very good size, with very shiny silver.I am delighted with the purchase."
1,"I sent this to a friend at work who lives in another state. Recently, she had one of her best friends to die. She was very sad. She absolutely loved this bracelet. She said it was really beautiful and that the card was wonderful as well."
1,A handsome pair of cuff links in a lovely box suitable for gift giving. They shipped it very quickly too.
0,"I was very disappointed with this bracelet. It did not resemble the photo at all. It was very shiny and cheap-looking. I have bought other bali items, which were very satisfactory from other sellers. Quite a let down."
1,This ring is very masculine and eye catching!I got it for my prince of a boyfriend and he gets compliments on it all the time! It is very expensive if you get it on the original sellers website so get it for cheaper from amazon!
1,"When I received my turtle ring, I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was even better than described and I have had tons of compliments on this ring. The shipping and packaging was bar none better than most jewelry companies I have purchased from. You won't be sorry if you decide to order this ring from Gem Avenue."
1,"I bought this ring probably a year ago, and it's definitely one of my everyday rings. It looks just like the picture, very true to size. Very cute and adorable, and unlike a lot of rings, it's flat enough that it doesn't get in my way. I think my only complaint is that I wish the feet were a little more detailed."
1,"I purchased this bracelet for my wife for Christmas 2007 and she absolutely loved it. The metal is brilliantly polished and the stones look very nice. The baguettes don't sparkle as much as I had hoped, not sure if it is the stone quality, the diamond cut or the fact that the stones are set in the metal such that light doesn't penetrate from beneath the diamond (not really a diamond expert). That isn't to say they don't sparkle, they do, just not as much as her diamond rings and earrings. Shipping was very quick and delivered on time as promised. My wife had many compliments regarding the bracelet when she took it to work and she is extremely happy to have received it."
1,This little charm is so amazing and detailed so well. I bought it for my bracelet link cause it needed more charms and I absolutely love it! It's a great and amazing asset to my bracelet link!!
0,"The bracelet is beautiful, but alas two weeks after receipt of bracelet, one of the pink gems fell out and was lost. I considered it too expensive to return. Australian dollar exchange and deliver costs were too dear for me. But your site is fantastic...if only I used it in the USA"
1,I have to say this collar is so cute and my dog likes it because it is light. Don't think my dog is going to swallow it as previous a previous review states.
1,"when i heard that their was going to be paris hilton jewlery i was excited because i love her style . But i have a little chihuahua that loves tinkerbell , so its cool that my dog can wear jewlry inspired by tink. by the way this is my dogs prized possesion."
1,this ring is perfect not to big not to small. I get a lot of compliments!! its just a grreat piece!!
0,The delivery went as mentioned on the website but the product size was even smaller then mentioned.As a kid i had the same pendant ( that got stolen last year ) and it was even twice the size then these bought online.A pitty really since i bought 2 for our 8 years relationship`s celebration ( and we are in our late 30`s now ).They could have given a more precise measurement besides the option between small and big.Besides that the product is correct in quality and finishing.
0,"they send me a piece of junk. The silver part of the cord was so tarnish and it was rusted,how can they send me one looking like this? i ended up throwing it out. i have no time to send it back. i don't think i will be ordering from this vendor again."
0,"I ordered these earrings for my sister. when i finally got them the backs bent and one of the earrings had broken off of its backing. the jewelry was obviously badly handled, and would have been fine if it had been shipped properly. don't trust this specific jewelry dealer with your online orders! The earrings were only shipped in a manilla envelope with a little bubble wrap."
1,"Cute, must haves ... naturally good to go ! and get the matching necklace"
1,"The pearls are beautiful and mountings are nicely made. They go perfectly with the necklace my mother-in-law bought for me in China, and they look exactly in person like they did in the photo. I highly recommend this vendor for their jewelry."
1,"WHEN I SEEN THIS CHARM BRACELET I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS....SO I PURCHASED IT, GOT HERE FAST, OPEN THE BOX AND TO MY AMAZEMENT IT WAS IT, WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND REALLY WANTED TO OWN ONE, NOT THE CHARM, NOT THE BRAND, BUT THE BRACELET ITSELF, IT IS A WELL MADE DOUBLE 14KT GOLD BEACELET, WHEN I LOOK AT IT I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS NEATLY MADE, CLEAN AND CRISP LINES, PERFECT LOOPS AND JUST OVER ALL A CLEAN MADE BRACELET, WHAT I MEAN AS TO CLEAN AND NEAT IS YOU DONT SEE ALL THE GOLD WITH PITS AND HOLES IN IT, NO SHARP EDGES AND DEFFENTLY NOTHING FALLING APART LIKE MOST DRACELETS THAT SELL FOR A FEW BUCKS, THIS IS A WELL DESIGNED ITEM AND I CAN SAY I AM PROUD TO OWN IT"
1,"I was concerned about buying an opal online as some do not have much color, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received this pendant the color was beautiful."
0,"AT AMERICAN PEARL WEBSITE THEY HAD AN EXPENSIVE PRICE FOR THIS RING, TRY TO BUY IT BUT THROUGH AMAZON BUT WHEN SEND A QUESTION THEY CHANGE THE PRICE ON AMAZON WEB AND THEN NEVER ANSWER MY EMAILS. I'NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER AT ALL!!!!"
1,"It's what I thought it would be. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
1,"This ring rocks! I often wear it with a skeleton watch for an extra, full-bodied creepy effect...I get a lot of looks, questions and comments--Guys, makes a great ice-breaker...Gals, scares away wimps!What more could you ask for besides a few billion bucks to get bailed outby our govt.? The way I'm spending...I ought to be there in 2010![I hope!?] And HEY-If I do, the eyeball rings are on me!Additionally--it goes great with tattoos, piercings, and dreadlocks! [if you're in to that sort of thing...]."
1,"Using this cleaning/polishing cloth on silver jewelry is both incredibly easy and amazingly effective. It's almost scary to see how much tarnish comes off chains and bracelets that I thought looked okay. After using the cloth, they look fabulous."
0,I wiped and wiped and no change in how clean my jewelry looked. It was a huge disappointment for me.
1,cloths work great and are easy to use. Takes no time to polish all your silver jewelry. I would recommend!
1,Surpasses every brand I have every tried. Last and lasts. Makes all my silver pieces and jewelry look brand new.
0,"I received this bracelet a couple of days ago, and while the quality seems good, the color is really off. It's more gray and tan than it is red, which was a bit disappointing since the red looks so nice in the picture. I have seen similar bracelets for much higher prices, but if you have your heart set on a nice red agate, you might want to keep looking."
1,"I really wasn't sure about this one - the ring is adorable, but I'd never worn a dangle charm before and wasn't sure how it would look - IT LOOKS GREAT! I wear it all the time - it is so fun and flirty. I bought one for my friend who has a very different abdominal shape (I'm curvy with strong obliques, she's boxy with a super flat tummy) and it looks great on her too! A must add for your collection!"
0,"so this same one is at our local gas station for 3.50 so super cheap&theres of course no shipping&handling when purchasing from some place like a gas station .. i think its cute and i like how it has the cherry thing on it however this kind is not my style it looks to cheap and im not into red at all.i just left this review for the girls that like it/love it before buying this one on here since i bought some awesome ones on here&i love the ones i got off amazon,however before purchasing this cherry one check out your local gas stations that sales these kinda things such as navel rings might save you the waiting and its for sure cheaper then 7.50 or however much this one is not that thats a bad price since i paid 14.00 for my 4that i got off here but just check around saves u the s&h also i know our wal-mart carries this one for under 5.00... anyways more less i know times are hard right now for lots of people so just trying to say one this navel ring they sell it so many local places before buying this one just check a gas-station out&wal-mart=]"
1,"Beautiful ring. Great price. The garnets are rich in color, better in person. Fast delivery, excellent service, would buy again."
1,This ring goes perfectly with the multi-stone ring I ordered from the same seller. The silver band doesn't just flake away and turn my finger green like cheat rings do. It's a lovely ring that I will keep and wear for years! It's good enough quality to wear all the time!
1,These were absolutly beautiful. I didn't want to give them as a gift I wanted to keep them for myself.
1,"These are very nice! I actually expected them to be smaller, due to some of the other reviews. They are exactly the size I hoped they would be. The bigger bead is about the size of a large pea. I like them!"
1,"I, too, was leary of ""cheap"" jewerly. However, with Amazon's return policy I put this on my wish list. My honey bought it for me and when I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised. The ring is sterling silver and the colors of the stones, perhaps a shade lighter than in the picture, blend together to form a muted palette. I've gotten nothing but compliments and rave reviews about this ring. It shines and sparkles!"
0,"I've been looking around for a nice, 3 stone ring like this one for quite a while now. I finally settled on this one because of the picture. And by looking at the picture of this ring online - you might be misled like I was into thinking it doesn't look like a cheap ring. Don't be fooled. It looks terrible.After spending about $40 on this ring plus shipping, I am very displeased with this ring. It really does look like it came out of a quarter machine. The stones look like plastic (they don't shine and look like very poor quality cubic zarconia), and the band itself looks like cheap metal that would break easily if enough pressure was applied. I could get a better ring from Wal-Mart for $15 that looks better then this one - and I am serious. I'm very unhappy with this ring.A definite return of this item... Don't waste your money. You really wont like it."
0,these are cute not as big as i thought they were..kinda difficult to put in and i think way to expensive for this product these shouldnt cost more then $20..cute just way too pricey n im not cheap by any means
1,I bought this for my Mom. She recieved it and she absolutely loves it!!!I have not seen it yet. Mom said it it gorgeous!!Thank you!!
1,"I bought the eay cuff for my daughter. She love it, that was most important to me. With a cuff she did not have her cartledge pierced"
1,I am very pleased with my purchase. It was delivered in a timely manner and I love it. I'm glad I didn't let the price deter me. It's a beautiful accessory.
1,This product is so beautiful! It is a nice present for my sister. She is very happy with this one. She like a lot because the material -titanium- do not produce any alergic reaccions. Commendable for exigents!!
1,this is a great little sonic jewelery cleaner. It makes my earrings and necklaces look like new. Good price and fast shipping.
1,These are much prettier than the pictures. Excellent quality for the price. My daughter loves them.
0,"hard and can't wear it, the material is hard and not easy to wear I just don't like it I should have saved my money and got on from A&E"
1,I had to order this off the internet because the local stores are no longer carrying this charm. it came in on time and was just as good as the more expensive ones from the store
1,I have three pair of butterfly earrings made by Zarah and purchased from Clearly Charming. I love all three. They are very delicate and intricate. They go nicely with casual or work outfits. FUN!
1,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter-in -law who is going back to school for her MBA. She wanted a ""bookbag"" that wasn't the canvas bag from undergraduate days. She LOVES the purse and she is VERY particular. The leather is soft, the zipper allows for safety and there is room for her many ""gadgets"". It is a beautiful bag. I recommend it without reservation.JRM"
1,"I ordered four necklaces for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding. When they arrived, the beads were smaller than I had anticipated, but I loved them. They are so dainty! I'm not a fan of huge, chunky jewelry, so these were perfect. Each of them came with their own turquoise jewelry bag, which was an unexpected plus. My wedding's not until July, so I can't say anything about their durability, but they look like they'll hold up nicely."
1,"After searching far and wide, I would have to say that these are the best silver infant earrings that I've found. The best thing about them is that the screw back caps will not cut up the back of your child's ears, like many earring do. The back actually completely covers the point that goes through the ear, so their is no possibility of your child being scraped up. These earring are nice and flat, so they are less likely to get caught or snagged on clothing-- a big plus. The flower is cute and understated, a feminine touch without being too flashy. These earring are small, but not tiny.My daughter has worn these earring since she was 8 months old. Now at 17 months old, I've contemplated changing her out into some hoops, but since I've had no problems with these, I'll save the hoops until she is older. This is a great infant earring."
0,"My daughter pulled every other earring out, I was very pleased with this one. However after about 6 months the front of one of the earrings has just come off with the screw back left in her ear (which I'm not sure how to get out). Surely this is not the kind of quality one would expect from a good quality silver earring? I am frustrated and disappointed."
1,I bought 2 pairs for my twin daughter (2yr old) and these earings are AWESOME! I have one daughter that loves to touch her earings and use to loose earings daily. I love the screw back because she cant undo the earing. I check them weekly to make sure she hasnt loosen them. The screw backs are also great so they can sleep in them and not injure their ears. They are pretty small so perfect for a toddler. A little over priced but if it means I dont have to buy earing for a while works for me.
0,"The pic shown on the website is an enlarged pic of the actual item. It doesn't look as pretty as shown in the pic, so I returned the item."
1,"I was very pleased with the quality of this necklace, it was a gift and the person I gave it to love the quality of the change and the color of the peridot. The person that received the gift has worn it everyday since Valentine's day and it seems to be holding up well."
1,"I got this for Christmas and it is so nice... much nicer than it looks in the picture (and it looks nice there).It's a very well made, expensive looking bracelet, the stones are clear and large and I get a lot of compliments on it."
1,The Diamonds were as promised. The quality was superb. My wife was very pleased with them as I had hoped.
0,"I love how the pendant looks it is so pretty but one big problem, it will not stay shut, the second you put it on it pops right open makes it impossible to really wear :-("
1,"Peora necklaces are always very pretty and quickly shipped. I'm not a fan of the chains though, but I've been buying the pendants to put on homemade beaded necklaces for my bridesmaids. This one is my favorite, its cute but not a cheesy cute. Usually with Peora pendants I get them and am surprised by how small they are, while this one is listed with no measurements(it is approximately 20mm tall and 8mm at the widest point) its actually much bigger than I expected. It's beautiful and I can't wait to wear it to my wedding!"
1,"I am the Mrs - ghost writing this review. The ring is beautiful. I was doing reviews of other stuff we've ordered over the years - it;s been 6 years since he gave me this ring and I love it. It's not gawdy or blingy, like many of my friends rings (not that that is necessarily bad - just saying) I'm a hands-on sort of girl who likes doing messy things - like painting, working on house projects, gardening, extended hiking trips. This ring has proven a durable, stalwart and beautiful symbol of the commitment we made to each other. Highly recommended."
1,"Picture doesn't do it justice. The pendant is worthy of a heavier and nicer chain, but no fault of Silver Insanity. This piece is gorgeous!! I love doing business with this vendor."
1,"This necklace is beautiful. It looks good by itself and with pendants, charms, etc."
1,Sterling silver chain is excellent quality at a great price. Shipped within 24 hours and received faster than any other internet purchase. Would use again.
1,"I shopped around at local businesses for the same ring. Most stores only sold an SI2, but they were about $800.00. This ring is worth the money, if you can not afford the higher quality. It does not look any different and is very pretty. I am using it as a wedding band next to my higher quality engagement ring and the diamonds look the same. I had it verbally appraised and the dealer said he would think it was worth about $500.00."
0,"Pendant looks mass produced, gems look cheap and necklace is also cheap. Thought product would have been of better quality for the price."
0,this product seemed like it was done in a home garage.. it's not as advertised. if you were this product people will think that you made this in your own home.
1,My future mother-in-law gave this gift to me right before the wedding ceremony. I loved it. I opened the oyster right away and ended up wearing the necklace for the wedding instead of the expensive strand of pearls that I originally planned to wear. (I got a lavendar pearl) I would highly reccommend this gift for any female in your life.
1,"I love this. Much larger than any armoires available in local stores. Felt lined drawers. Lots of cubbies in several of the drawers. Arrived much sooner than anticipated. Packaging was wonderful, layer upon layer of protection."
1,"When I shopped for this for my wife in November '09, there were lots of similar products available via Amazon and elsewhere. I finally chose this one based on the price, the likelihood of its matching our other furniture and finish, and some nice features like the felt lining, mirrored lid, and various storage areas. I ended up having an issue with how the shipping costs were presented, and the vendor was very easy to work with. The item arrived promptly and, though in a very heavy box, required almost no assembly once I got it upstairs. It's nicely finished, has lined drawers with a quality feel, and has a nice assortment of storage drawers, doors, and under the mirrored lid. My wife (and therefore both of us) are very happy with this purchase."
0,"I recieved the armoire in seven days. Very fast. But, I could tell there was going to be a problem, because the box was smashed in and I could see the armoire before I even opened it. It took my boyfriend and I to open it. When opened, the back top of the armoire had been previoulsly damaged. It had glue on it. The left side of the door had broken off, and there were many scratched on it. Very disappointed. Sent it back. I did order the Wilmington Cherry and Burl because the shipper has high ratings. AtHomeMart."

1,I was a bit leary because other champagne purchases from other online vendors turned out to be heavily included and not a champagne color. These really surprised me and are beautiful and clean.
1,I just got this ring today and I really like it. I bought it as a splurge for myself. It's small and dainty and I think it's a perfect right hand ring--it doesn't over shadow wedding rings or engagement rings.The diamond is nice and sparkly and the band is solid--no hollow parts in this ring!I think it would make a nice starter ring. It looks great with some accent bands I already own. Thanks amazon!
0,I bought this to give to my bridesmaids a few months in advance. It looked ok when it first arrived but then a few wks later the necklace part rusted and tarnished and I haven't even given them yet to the bridesmaids. Total waste of money~!
1,I love this ring. I didn't buy this ring on Amazon. I don't know where this ring originally came from or how long it's been around but I have one. It was my Grandpa's and I got it 15 years ago when he died. It is a lovely ring. Silver and Turquoise have always been my favorite colors too. And the coral goes really well with the turquoise.
1,"My son gave this to his 13 year old sister. She adored it. It's not childish, and the charms are pretty. Perfect gift for a teen. It comes in a purple box decorated with a box and a sweet saying inside."
1,"I gave the bracelets to my 4 sisters and 1 adopted sister. They absolutely loved them. Although they are not very expensive, they look like they are! They are exquisite! I would not hesitate to purchase more items!"
1,"This bracelet is so pretty! The beads on the bracelet are purple though, but that works better because my sister loves purple. It is a really good deal for this bracelet. I know she is going to love it!"
1,Bracelet were really nice and they were also boxed great for just wrap and give. I think they are great for little girls.
1,"I bought this bracelet for my older sister for christmas. and when she opened it, the message in the box brought her to tears. The box itself was beautiful. Totally recommend."
1,I got this for my sister and did not want her to see the price. So I emailed the seller and they respsode quick. Shipping was fast and I think she will loved it. I have not seen it since she leaves in another state.
1,"Beautifully wrapped! Im giving this to a close friend of mine and it is very well made! And for such a low price to, its a great gift Im tempted to buy one myself cause they are just so well made and pretty!"
1,I purchased this for my 5 sisters. We all have the same on now. I love it. They love it too. They were not surprised that I had gotten us all the same one because I always buy us similar jewelry. Very nice gift!!
1,I bought this for my best friend who is like a sister to me and she absolutely loved it...it's perfect and beautiful I would recommend it to anyone for their sister or friend..it's gonna be gratefully accepted and loved
1,"I needed something low cost but charming and elegant for my sister, who is very spiritual and likes inscriptions and things. She loved it!"
1,"this is the best gift if you are looking to give it to your sister or a best friend that you think of as a sister. It shipped from Little Rock, AR & it came in really fast. she loves this & for the price you can't go wrong."
1,"This ring doesn't look exactly like the picture, as mentioned by other reviewers. The stone is a brighter London blue topaz than it appears in the photo, which appeals to me. The setting is small and delicate. The width of the band is narrow, but the bottom of the shank seems thick enough to resist minor everyday wear as long as you don't bash your jewelry around too much. The silver is bright and shiny, not semi-antiqued like it looks in the photo. These things do not detract from my enjoyment of this ring, however. It is quite lovely in person."
1,"I bought this for my to-be niece as a flower girl gift. She's 4 and loved it.. Though she didn't wear it for the wedding. It was a nice and affordable gift that can be saved for the next generation, or maybe to give to her brand- new baby sister."
1,"its a bit smaller than i had envisioned, but its got alot of rustic detail to it. touch your middle finger to your thumb and thats about how big it is. its got a pretty decent weight to it. the chain could have been a little bit longer but no biggie there especially considering the price. its a good deal!"
0,the earrings look way larger then they actually are...perfect for a baby's ear but not for an adult woman...very disappointed for price charged...do not feel they are worth it...I am returning them.
1,These errings are very pretty. You can dress them up or wear with jeans. Just the right amount of sparkle. I love them.
1,"I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality, clarity and beauty of these earrings. I visit the Swarovski store from time-to-time and the prices I get from Amazon just beat the pants off their store. I've had many compliments and they look so expensive and reflective that I'm very proud to wear them.SCER020 Exquisite Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver Leverback 1.25"" Long Dangle Earrings"
1,"Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get.By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!(Review of Shimmering Clear Swarovski Crystal 925 Sterling Silver Threader Ear Wire Earrings)"
1,"These earrings are great! I was actually looking for leverbacks with this shape crystal and was able to cut off the crystal and attach it to leverbacks, and love them!"
1,These earrings are both dainty and very eloquent. Thhey would make a great gift and or present to yourself....very happy with the item...the sparkle is so pretty.
0,"Not bad for the price I guess, but very cheap. The backs nearly bent off after wearing them twice. If you're extra careful, they do look nice, just not great quality."
1,I love ball chains and I think that they are hard to find. I was very pleased when I found them on Amazon and very pleased when the 2 I ordered arrived. Very nice quality. Arrived quickly.
1,"I ordered this chain for my husband. He wanted something that he could wear everyday with a small medallion. This totally fit the bill, it is substantial, but not big enough to look like he is wearing it under his dress shirts and t-shirts. The length is perfect "" dog tag"" length. He has been wearing it everyday for a month; so far no problems at all. I would recommend this chain for men and women."
0,"I was a little disappointed, it wasn't made very well. However, for the price it's pretty good."
1,"I was thrilled to get my pendant. I had searched far and wide for it, and was happy to find it on Amazon.The speed it took, to come to Australia from America was incredible! I couldn't belive it was so fast.I would like to thank everyone involved."
0,"With the low price of this ring, I knew I was taking a gamble. But, much to my surprise it looked better in person. Nice, not an overly costume piece. Too bad it seems to run a half size bigger than the true ring sie. I have small fingers to start with though, so it is hard to find a good fit. I gave it to my mom-in-las and she loved it."
0,"i would have expected this to be a little less bulky. but it does the job its intended for, it doesnt make your piercing look like nothing, but it camouflages it enough that employers cant tell if you wear it covered by your hair or something"
1,"I bought this as a surprise for my daughter--so, I guessed at the size. Boy, was I way off! The shop took it back and sent another with no problems. My daughter loves it!"
1,"Not huge so it doesn't hold a lot of jewelry, but it holds enough to make me happy, plus it's small enough that I can carry it in my (pretty large) purse."
1,"I purchased this item for my trip in August. I was very pleased with the way it protected my fine jewelry. The size was perfect because it did not take up much room in my purse; I put my jewelry there when I travel. I would recommend this pouch to everyone who wants to protect their fine jewelry or any jewelry when they travel. Also, I was very pleased with the timely manner in which I received this product. I have purchased several items from Amazon and am extremely happy with the service I have received each time."
1,I travel a lot and wanted something to bring my jewelry with that was both functional and beautiful. I love it so much I intend to purchase one for all the women in my family for christmas!
1,"I'd been searching for a travel jewelry roll for several years. I'd given my mother one in the 90s but couldn't find one for myself. This one is beautifully made, with very high quality fabric and excellent workmanship. I love the multiple smaller pockets because I can separate items so they don't scratch each other. The whole piece is lovely with real heirloom quality."
1,"Just the perfect way to carry jewelry in your purse. Separate compartments prevent pieces of jewelry from tangling . Vibrant colors enhances the look. I purchased one in each of the these colors of champagne gold, garnet burgandy, and blue to give as gifts to my friends."
1,"This jewelry roll is beautiful! It looks almost like real silk, and the embroidery is so unique & intricate. The jewelry roll is well-made & durable, too. I love this, and I recommend it highly!"
1,"Product is exactly as shown in picture. It is very colorful. It is small and flattens for ease with packing in a suitcase, yet has ample space to store your jewelry. Beautifully made. Quality product."
1,"Love it. The ring holder is a great idea and buttons, and it's not hidden so you can see them when you open the roll. The zippered pockets inside are a little smaller than I anticipated(some of my pieces of jewelry are large, but would hold standard necklaces and earrings well), but the quality is excellent and the overall size is perfect. Not too big and will fit in my small travel vanity bag along with my other items. Can't wait to use it for our upcoming cruise. The quality is truly very good! I purchased it in the garnet red color and it's beautiful. I plan on getting a few in other colors for gifts."
0,the item was not as luxurious as I expected. The ring roll is almost flat. The strings must go around too many times.
0,"I could not believe how many people rated this item favorably. I was shocked when I opened it. It is such poor quality that I can't even believe they are charging fifteen bucks for it. It's worth about three, and I bet you could find it in any Chinatown for that. Probably even better for three bucks!It is extremely small too. The zippers are poor quality, and the stitching that holds the ring guard and button on look like they are about to fall off...very poorly made. Even the embroidery is horrendous.My mom gave me one of these years ago that puts this one to shame. I saw one in The Met catalog, I think I'll head over to their site and see if it's on sale.At any rate, I am gonna keep looking, and return this junk. A pillowcase would be better than this!"
1,I hate to shop in stores and was very pleased to find this item...it is exactly what I wanted...and more. It is beautiful and very well made and the multiple zippered pockets are great for chains and bracelets...no tangles for a change. I also love the ring holder. It came much faster than I'd expected so I'm also pleased with the service. I think this would make a wonderful gift..I'd love to get one!
1,"I have searched for the perfect jewelry travel organizer and found it with this item! It is luxurious, practical, very pretty and comes in a variety of colors. Once mine arrived I ordered two more for my sisters! You have to have this if you travel!"
1,"The charm is a little heavy but is comfortable enough to wear all day on game day. The logo is clear and you can tell what it is at a glance. I get compliments on it all the time. The best team in the NFL. It looks very good in, high quality."
1,"This ring is just awesome. It is even more prefect than it is described on the picture. And it fits my finger well and comfortablly. I get so used to it as soon as I wear it. I love this ring. And I recommend it to any costumers who are looking for a unisex , cool and unique ring. Love the seller! :)"
0,"Silver Filigree Marcasite Genuine Amethyst Cross LocketThe cutouts offer NO protection to the 2 pictures I would like to put in it. A locket after all is meant to be worn for years AND protect the contents. The locket is essentially an open picture frame and rain or humidity will ruin my pics. Please mention this feature IN the ad. I had no Christmas present for my daughter, paid shipping and now have to pay shipping back.The marcasite elements are SO minute that the piece has no dazzle which marcasite has a reputation for.Spring clasp on chain sticks open, does not open all the way; too undependable."
0,"I liked the necklace but teethe hinge is loose and makes it crooked, which makes it look cheap, disappointing! My Luke this holiday season was notgood"
1,"More than I expected, absolutely beautiful. Expensive looking. Accessorizes many colors.I hope the prices remain the same, I will order more."
1,I loved the leaf design. It looks nice with other rings of similar texture and color so I wear it on my middle finger. Have gotten many compliments on it...and the price was really reasonable. I have recommended it to my friends who like sterling silver rings like I do.
0,"I for sure didn't want to listen to the other reviews about this ring bending and breaking really easily so I bought it anyways. but it'strue. Its really pretty but i've had mine for several months and it bent badly in the first couple months i had it. never broke, but only because i wear it sparingly for special occasions. I wouldn't buy this again"
1,"This locket is so much prettier in person then in the picture! The silver has a beautiful shine to it, and the garnet just radiates red beauty. I'm using this as a scent locket, and it has plenty of openings in the front to let perfume waif out."
1,I love my silver knot stud earrings! I wear one in a second hole in my ear and gave the other to the bestie. They are low maintenance. I've worn my for months and have had no issues. Great quality.
0,"I bought these mainly for the backs, and with the hope they would be of high enough quality for my second hole. The backs are great; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking. Buyer beware; I would never wear them out, nor consider them as giftable. The company (Sabrina Silver) was a pleasure to do business with"
1,These earrings are so pretty and so dainty. They came beautifully packaged and my eight year old grand daughter just loved them.
1,i got these yesterday and i am wearing them as i write this.they are tiny but really cute and the posts fit smoothly.love them!
0,"This pendant was cute, but much smaller than the picture portrayed it. The quality was good, but not what I was looking for. Would not have bought it if I knew how small it really was."
0,"It's ok if what you are looking for is a very tiny heart, I'll probably give it to my 8 year old niece."
1,"I got this as a ""part-time"" replacement which is identical to my engagment ring, but work in not such safe areas sometimes and always feared being robbed. It is amazingly gorgeous and authentic-looking. I get multiple compliments and the only thing that makes me feel a bit guilty is that I'm not wearing my actual ring. The zirconias look real in every light. I wish it wasn't so pricey though, I'd but them all so that when the rhodium eventually wears off, I could swap it. Try to avoid washing dishes or using strong soaps as this will eventually wear off the rhodium and you know what a pain it is to polish silver :)"
1,"I was very impressed with the timely delivery of my earrings. They were packaged well and the people at Sabrina Silver had included another copy of my invoice for my convenience. The earrings themselves were a little smaller than I had hoped, but still, I haven't taken them off since I got them! I will definetely be ordering from Sabrina Silver again!"
1,"I was a bit skeptic at first until these finally came in. I absolutely love them! They're very shiny and lustrous, the star stands out well against the black stud. Will be buying from this vendor much more often now."
1,love these earrings....can wear with 3 different outfits (colors)..have the right lenght and a great sparkle....service is always prompt....thanks
1,"Wonderful value, amazing spreed of shipping. Couldn't have wished for more/ Will deal with them again without hesitation. Ryan went out of his way to acommodate my order."
1,I love this ring! I wear it every day. I'm born in January and have a really hard time finding a garnet ring that was set in sterling (allergic to gold) that i liked. so this ring was an awesome buy for the money.
1,"I love this ring. I purchased this and the five stone garnet band ring from Gem Avenue. This ring is a deep, rich red. It looks very expensive. The silver is highly polished like white gold and substantial in weight. I highly recommend this ring."
1,"This ring is absolutely beautiful and makes a great addition to my jewelry collection. I purchased it because I had been searching or a silver ring with garnet stones, which is not always the easiest combination to find. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when I found it online. Also, the classic style of the ring was a plus; it can be worn with different styles of jewelry and never seems out of place. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and will continue to shop with Gem Avenue!"
0,"Very disappointed in the size. Not until this review request did the description state ""Tiny"". The word ""Tiny"" is an understatement.""Microscopic"" is a better description. I believe there will be a problem at any attempt to put these on the ear because they are absolutely too small."
1,"I had origianlly bought skull earrings from the same seller but the were to small, so i exchanged it for these. These skull and crossbones earrings are way better. They are bigger than the ones I orignally bought. It's a perfect size and fit. And don't be fooled if the crossbones look crooked in the picture. The ones you recieve will be straight diagnal like they should be. If anyone has their ears pierced and loves this jolly roger symbol, I highly recommend that you by these earrings."
1,Great looking ring. I like things that are different -- not the every day run of the mill. It's a fun ring!!!
0,"The quality is great, they are an interesting piece of jewelry. They come wonderfully packaged along with a post card from the jewlers designers. The problem is the width of the earring wire! It is too fat for my ears! I could hardly put them on, and when I did, it irritated my ears so much I couldn't wear them. It is a shame because they are lovely."
1,"i bought these for my 9 year old daughter. they are well made, dainty and perfectly sized for her. lever backs are sturdy yet fashionable and easy to take in and out. would definitely reccommend."
1,"Of all the Sajen rings I have (approx. 16), this is probably the most beautiful one I own. The stone is really unbelievable -- a very dark red -- and the faceting of the stone is spectacular. The silver of the ring is also exquisite, both in color and in its high polish. The silver is almost a white silver, it is that bright. And the weight of the ring is substantial; as with all Sajen rings, the band is very thick and sturdy. As for the design -- there are silver swirls not only on the band, but also on the vertical sides of the gemstone setting, which you cannot really see in the photo, but which is hinted at in the description. This ring is stunning enough for evening wear, yet it is such a neat size, you could easily wear it to the office."
1,I absolutely love these. Not only that but I get compliments every time I wear them. Look great with just about any color. Wish I had ordered the necklace also. Ordering a couple more pairs for gifts.
1,"These earrings are truly unique. The pattern is almost an exact match on one side of each stone and the other side slightly different, but a pleasing combination. Wonderful!"
0,"I gave this pendant to my wife, she wore it two or three times and it broke. The link where the pendant and chain met broke off."
1,The best seller for the best in Swarovski crystal earrings. Always fast shipping.
1,This is a beautiful ring. It showed the different variations of color in purple jade. I look forward to wearing it. The rings were packed securely and everything arrived early. I plan to order more items from GEM Avenue.
1,"Great ring for the price, niece has received a lot of compliments on this, quite sparkly and stones seem to be holding up well."
1,"This pendant was a lot larger than I expected. It is absolutely beautiful, and I have received many compliments on it. Would make a great gift for a loved one!!"
1,"Bought the matching earrings that go with this thing. Looks good, nice and shiny to keep the war department from calling me a cheap skate and I got a hall pass out of it."
1,"My pendant came out a nice blue color, slightly richer than the pendant pictured. In a word, it is beautiful. The product appears well made and is certain to get compliments!"
1,Thank you. Wonderful product price wise and quality wise.The stone is great. Now will look for nice matching earrings.
1,I was worried when I ordered this that it would look like a $5 fake but was very happy when i received it in the mail. The box silver chain is much better quality than other comparable necklaces on amazon and the stone is very beautiful. Its almost too big! I love it! Highly recommend it as a gift as well.
1,"Bought it for my sister as a birthday gift together with the earrings, and she really enjoyed it, even more than what I was expecting. She uses it very often"
1,I also bought this for myself. It has my birthstone in it. I just love it and haven't taken it off since it came. I just love it!!!
1,"This was a great gift for my girlfriend, she loves it and hasn't takin it off since i gt it for her. Product shipped on time, well packaged, no damage, i highly recommend buying from this seller."
1,"Used a different chain due to size, but the pendant itself was very nice. I wasn't expecting it to look as good as it does on account of the price, so it's certainly worth it."
1,"This is a very pretty necklace. The chain is on thinner side, but strong enough to carry the pendant. The topaz is just the right size and has a nice shine to it. It does require frequent cleaning though as the chain tends to corrode easily which is the case with all silver jewellery anyway."
1,This was a wonderful gift from my husband and I love it...Arrived safely and on time for Christmas.
0,"I got this for my Mom as it's her birthstone (Dec. 2). However, while the stone is very clear and bright exactly as photos. It had a small crack on top of the stone. It might not be too obvious, but it is visible to naked eyes. If I had enough time I would have requested a return, too bad It came 2 days before her birthday."
1,"i love clear! i use this for my makeup. I don't have an extensive MAC makeup or anything like so, I'm a business professional. Just two mascaras, three eyeliners, etc, and it fits it all perfectly. Really cute, three drawers, totally worth the price."
0,It looks awesome out of the box. Just like the picture. But within a couple of days I could start to see that it was getting scratched even when I was being consciously extra careful. After that I figured it wasn't going to make much of a difference whether I was careful or not. That made life lots easier.
0,"Appears to be quality piece, smaller than I thought, however that's my fault for not reviewing and being fully aware of mm sizing..delivered on time in good condition...pricey for chain this small and thin, however if it holds up well to daily wear and tear it will be worth the purchase price..."
1,"I bought this necklace because it was very on sale, and I was surprised by how much I loved it when it arrived. The beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture, which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. It's a bold necklace, but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse."
1,I'm very pleased with this earrings.. I loved it.It is just slightly heavy but still it is so worth you money.I will sure shop again..
1,"Well, the shipping was very fast and she loved the earings! They were exactly what I had expected. As always, Amazon has not failed me again"
0,"These are very nice, but are alittle heavy. The white diamond sections take away from the overall look. Still... for the price,,, a great deal!"
0,The textured pattern on this bracelet makes it look a rather dull gray color. The one I received is darker and not as shiny as the image on Amazon.
1,I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package with my bracelet in it. The style goes so well with my other bangles and the 'waves' really stand out. It was a great bargain and I love it!
1,"THis ring is so lovely. It is the type of jewelry you can wear with any kind of outfit, whether casual or formal. Of course, if you love anything Celtic or Wiccan, then this is a must have! It is an absolute bargain!!!!"
0,"This nose screw needs to be sanded down. It appears it is put together from two pieces, and the junction is riddled with sharp plastic-y points. I opted not to shred my nose up in an attempt to get it in. If you have sand paper and feel like finishing the product, then it may well be worth it."
1,"Excellent product, exactly what I was looking for. Shipping a little expensive for such a small product."
1,This ring is perfect for me! It's very sterdy and I get alot of compliments on it. I wear it all the time. Great fit.
1,"The moment I opened these and felt the weight, I knew they were a quality product. They manage to look so elegent and delicate, but they are made to last and the secure lock is a marvel. This is one pair that, unlike many others, won't break my heart when I look in a mirror and find I only have one. I love these!"
0,"The earring is very small!It does not look golden. It has a funny silver color.The stone has NO clarity and, if not 1 inch from the eye, you cannot say it is pink. Also, funny color.One of the earrings' closing device does is loser than the other and the &#34;safety locker&#34; does not seem much useful.It really disappointed me."
1,I bought the starter bracelet and a couple of charms for a 13yr old. She is going to love it! All were recieved in less than 7 days and were packed very well. Would do business with this company again.
1,"When I opened up the box containing this ring I WAS SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! I ordered a size 5, and that's exactly what I got! The diamond cut makes it sparkle beautifully in the light and the classical Black Hills leaves are EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE LOOKS! Thank you for describing this ring honestly, and because of your honesty I will be a return customer! WHAT A BEAUTIFUL RING!"
1,"The chain is extremely thin, giving it a bit of an effeminate look. Thinner than I expected. but very good quality at a great price."
1,"excellent chain, just what i was after. would defo buy another like this in another size. not cheap looking and exactly what i was looking for."
0,Love this chain. It is very nice and thin. Love wearing it. Weareach day and never remove. Would recommend
1,Love this product and the seller is super to work with. We'll do more business in the future!
1,"LOVE this chain! It is long, thin and delicate. Very feminine and beautiful. Buy this!"
0,"I bought two of these chains, and they each were beautiful and had no major problems. However, both of them tended to break apart with little or no force. One got snagged in my hair and just very lightly tugging on it caused it to break. The other just broke out of the blue and fell off my neck."
0,"I am allergic to sterling silver. I have ordered countless items I have had to return because of adverse reactions. Amazingly, this chain, which I have doubled and wear as an ankle bracelet, has not bothered me at all. It hasn't turned me green or me, it. It hasn't caused red, itchy patches. It hasn't caused swelling. It doesn't look like the most expensive chain in the world, but it does the job and I haven't had any adverse reactions."
0,"Well, the chain by itself is good & durable.. looks pretty too. However, I broke my previous chain is why I ordered it. That was way thinner, a lil less shiny so looked more original.. this is as shiny as a spoon... I kept it coz returning is like loosing 50% of money and getting nothing.Good for people looking for something shiny."
1,"I had been looking for a chain for a while to go with a special pendant that came on a different chain. This was the perfect length, sturdy yet delicate and just the right length. I love it and wear it everyday."
1,I would definitely order from this seller again. It arrived very fast and exactly as described. Excellent product!!!
1,Arrived exactly as pictured and described. Just what I was looking for.
1,This chain arrived quickly and it was exactly as described! I love it!
1,I am glad I bought this for my wife on our anniversary. It's now one of her favorite necklace. I do suggest getting the matching pair of earrings.Overall good quality & excellent looks!
1,"I tried on a ton of necklaces to wear on my wedding day. This one was absolutely perfect. It has that vintage glam look that I was looking for, and it matched my dress perfectly. I loved it! I didn't like the earrings as much, but mostly because they're not what I'm used to. I did wear them for my wedding to match the necklace though.The necklace is pretty fancy, and I'm not sure if I'll wear it very often...but it was great for my wedding :)"
1,"Very happy! Great sparkle and detail on the front, back, and chain. The length is adjustable which is handy. Looks spectacular with the matching earrings."
0,My daughter wore this with the matching earrings on her wedding day. They looked great!
1,I purchased this necklace for my daughter to wear on her wedding day. We looked at all the high-end jewelery stores and never found anything that was unique. I found this necklace and it is perfect. My daughter loves it.
1,"Nature has a way of beautifully carrassing your body and making you look absolutely stunning at the same time. There is nothing more beautiful on a woman than a bracelet of turquoise bracelet with sterling silver highlights that make people take a second look to see what is so eligent on our wrist. This bracelet is made of tube turquoise and sterling silver and is so carrassingly beautiful you will want to wear it everyday. I do, and it is even my birthstone. Spoil yourself with some of nature's wonderful beauty and make yourself beautiful with nature."
1,"This is a wonderfully crafted ring. Sterling Silver, 6.60 millimeters with, and has a very comfortable design. Very impression on the hand. Generally rings this heavy are bulky feeling, but the wave of the edges really cause you not to notice this read. Has the Claddagh symbols inside Celtic knot work, blending the more modern interpretation with tradition designs.It a stunning, beautiful ring that one would expect to pay four times the price."
0,This was the most pitiful thing I had ever seen. I had been so excited that I had found a bracelet that was nearly identical to one that had recently gotten stolen. My previous bracelet was purchased at a mall kiosk and for almost the same price so I was in heaven. I couldnt wait to receive my new bracelet. !!! What a true disappointment...I would not have bought this item for $10 had I seen it. I have bought many many things from Amazon and will continue but this was an eye-opener.
0,I am sure I would have rated it highly if I received it. I sent it to a freinds address and she said she never received it.
1,Earrings were prettier in person than in the picture. Quick shipping. Very impressive.
1,The silver frames on the garnet stones set them off beautifully. My wife loves them.
1,I shopped quite extensively for a descent pair of diamond stud earrings and these are the best deal/quality I could find. I searched local jewlers and a lot of online shops and Amazon came out on top. I am very happy with them. They are very shiny and have excellent color to them!
1,"this is alot of necklace for the money, have seen similar for 5x more in price"
1,"The necklace is much prettier than the picture. It is not a large pendant, but the intricate details are more pronounced than the picture shows. It is elegant."
1,"This beautiful and simply elegant piece of jewelry was a treasure. I gave them as gifts to family members because I knew that every time they wore them, they would feel they were wearing something special. Sajen packaged this lovely jewelry in a blue velvet pouch inside of a navy blue gift box....THANK YOU AMAZON for making a quality product affordable and available. Consuelo T. Gabriel"
1,"I am pleased with the look of this ring. I have been looking for a tri-tone look. I ordered one size larger because of the interlocking rings, I thought it may be tighter. Sometimes my fingers swell so I can easily wear the ring on two fingers."
0,Horrible quality! The ring is electroplated and is already flaking off onto my fingers/hands whenever I wear it! Not worth the cost
1,"My Husband and I incorporated our 3 month old daughter into our Wedding ceremony. We were looking for just the right piece of jewely that would be placed on her during the ceremony. We thought the 3 hearts were perfect. The smallest represents our daughter, the middle myself and the largest my husband. Of course she is too young for it now, but when she is old enough she will LOVE this piece as much as we do. It is stunning."
1,"The ring came very quickly and well wrapped. The ring itself was even more beautiful than I thought it would be from the picture. I absolutely love it. I would buy from this seller again in a second, and I probably will."
0,"This is a nice pinky ring, but overall rather on the tiny side for any other finger."
0,I love the ring the only problem is that the stone is loose. You can feel it move and hear it more. That is the only thing that I'm not happy with.
1,"I just love this ring. It has so much quality about it for the low price. I ordered the blue topaz. The stone is a little lighter than I thought it was going to be, but it still is beautiful. I received the package in a 100% condition and it arrived rather fast. I would recommend this seller to everyone that is interested in a good product and good service."
1,"I absolutely love this ring, not only is it beautiful it fits perfect. I love the emerald color. So pretty!"
0,"The stone is very pretty, but its smaller then i thought it would be. The metal looks and is cheap, the silver 'paint' on it is already chipping off. Over all I was not impressed with this ring, it looks cheap but I guess you get what you pay for right? I would not recomend it to anyone looking for something that looks expensive."
1,The ring is very nice looking and the stone is proportionate to the size of the ring. Its not too bulky and loks very femanine.
1,"Ring arrived fast. I purchased based on the reviews. It has caught the attention of a few. Quite feminine and lovely, polished and stone is clear. Well worth the price. Alwyas wear it, no problems. Sizing fit exactly."
1,"This is a lovely ring, very comfortable to wear and delicate looking without being too fragile. Great service from the company too - came quickly and in a lovely package."
1,"I purchased the ring and it fit perfectly! The emeral zirconia is super cute and it looks just like in the picture! I'm glad that I purchased it, it fits and looks perfect!"
1,"Bought this for a friend of mine so my review is based on what she told me and what I noticed.PROS:- Pretty resistant.- Will NOT make your finger green or turn too easily.- Great if you're looking for something fun but not really impressive.CONS:- It's a relatively cheap ring so don't set your expectations too high.Overall, it's great, my friend does not complain and she never takes it off.I recommend this seller to anyone looking to buy this ring.FINAL RATING"
1,"Gave this as a little gift to my sister, looked excellent (if not a bit small). Overall a great purchase."
1,"I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday, and I love the craftsmanship. The Celtic knotwork is beautifully delicate and just what we were looking for."
1,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my younger sister since it's her daughter's birthstone and her first Christmas with her daughter. She almost didn't get it - I wanted to keep it for myself! Great buy!
1,Recieved it on time and is absolutely beautiful!!!! Its the perfect gift and at amazing prices. Must have for ring lovers
1,The ring was very pretty. The rimg arrived quickly and in great wonderful condition. It was packaged very nicely in a box. I was very satisfied with this product and seller and would try them again.
1,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!! The stone does look fake if you look really really close to it, and it is actually darker in real life then it is in the picture, but aside from those minor things I love everything about it! I get soooooo many compliments on it and people always ask me where I got it from and their jaws drop when I tell them I got it off amazon.com and for the price!!! It's amazing and looks soooo good on!!!"
1,I was very happy with the service and the product. I received my ring very quickly. The ring is beautiful. Everyone that sees it makes some comment about it and wants to know where I got it. I plan on making future purchases with Gem Avenue!
1,sharp looking ring and the price is right. fits just like i wanted and on the finger that i wanted it to
1,"Ring is great, looks just like advertised, and very beautiful. The price makes on skeptical, but it looks good and fits well.Gem Aavenue was also great, postal service lost my package, and they not only kept in contact with me, but sent me a new one free of charge. Great service, great product, and I would definitely recommend it."
1,"The ring was not exactly as I imagined it to be. The picture made the stone look like it has a purple tint to it. The stone is completely colorless. The band is a little daintier than I thought it would be as well, but it doesn't matter if you have slender fingers. The person I got this for loves it so I'm very happy with this ring."
1,"I bought this for my granddaughter. She loved it, but it was a little large forher finger."
1,"Will this ring last 100 years? I'm not completely sure, but it sure is a great deal for its price. It's beautiful, and let me give a gift to my fiancee that didn't break the bank. Since we are experiencing intense family drama, often centered around money and the lust for more, we like that it's a cheap and powerful signal to certain people that we can see real beauty beyond dollar signs. She loves it. :)"
1,"This ring was purchased as a surprise gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. Definitely doesn't look like the price, I was very impressed with the quality. Obviously this isn't a of engagement quality but it definitely does the job for a surprise gift or anniversary. The price can't be beat for the quality of this product. I will be buying from this seller again and the shipping was lightning fast!"
0,"I liked it, until the stone fell out. If you look at how the ring is constructed, the stone is just sitting between the two metal arms. That mean if one gets twisted or pulled, out goes the stone.It wasn't worth the money to send it back.I guess you get what you pay for."
0,"it looks pretty cute when i open it. but when i look clearly through it, there are some damages. scratches, band, etc. even that, i still would like to order it again for size 6. overall, it's a great gift to any females. im pretty sure they'd love it."
1,"This toe ring is nice. I've had two other toerings (different designs) before that broke, but this one is solid. It's flexible enough so you can resize, but it's solid enough that it won't split. I really like it."

0,"I got the necklace that matches these earrings two years ago and wanted the matching earrings, but for two years they have been unavailable. Would not have gotten the necklace if I had known I would never be able to get the earrings to complete the set. Very disappointed."
1,"My girlfriend was delighted with this ring. I don't really believe in diamond exploitation and it's origin, and Mossianite was a nice option to buy a ring with a beautiful stone. And it also has a very pretty box! It's a nice way to have a good product at a good price."
1,"Need I say more? I ordered one for one for my mother for Christmas and another for myself, and I'm so glad I did! The pendant is unusual, modern, and fashionable.If this item becomes available again, I will snap up several as gifts for friends (with the matchingSterling Silver Small Cushion-Shaped Drop Earrings, for a polished, put-together look), even if I have to pay full price--something I almost NEVER do! But it really is that lovely."
1,We'll recomend it to other.Our group we'll love to ware it while on their incentive trip.Thank you!Kiddy Hamman
1,"The charm was as shown, service and packaging was excellent. An excellent trade and I recommend as it was a perfect transaction. Will order from them again"
1,"I bought this as a ""deal of the day"" and am very pleased. This is a high quality piece of jewelery th at I enjoy wearing."
1,The quality of the necklace is superb. It arrived promptly. Prettier than the picture.
0,"I got the first of 4 of these I ordered today. And, the diamond chips do not show up the way I've had diamond chips show up in other sterling jewelry. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I did get it at the extra 70% off, so I won't return the ... but I won't give them as a showcase gift to children, but instead along with something else. I think the chain seems rather durable, and in that regard, I think it will work well for kids."
1,I purchased this with a gift certificate for myself.For the price you can not complain too much- this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box.I suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece.
0,"The chain is flimsy and weak. The pendant itself is rather cheap looking. The diamond ""chips"" are so small that there is really no sparkle. However, since I paid only $15 for it, I can't complain that much. I put it on another chain that I had with a smaller pendant to add color and it worked out fairly well. Wait for the Friday Sale for this or the Deal of the Day like I did for a better deal."
1,"I have had this necklace for years and it is still in good condition. I do wish it was a bit more sparkly but I didn't buy real diamonds so... I have gotten a lot of compliments and I mentioned I had gotten it on Amazon and the seller's name. Hopefully, others have purchased due to the recommendation."
1,"This is a goegeous ring. I absolutely love it. It's a bit more grey than black, and very shiney. It also came in the cutest little gift box. I would recommend this ring to anyone who likes hematite. I would suggest getting at least a half size larger than your regular ring size, though, as stone rings don't have the give that metal rings do. This ring is fantastic; I love it!"
1,"I was actually worried about buying this, because I had heard from a lot of people that hematite rings broke easily, and I can be ridiculously clumsy and rough, so me and fragile things do not mix. But I have had no problems, I wear it every day and it seems very durable. It is also beautiful, I like it better than similar more expensive rings I've seen in stores."
1,"I was expecting a black band, what I got was this beautifully crafted and shined and smoothed to a perfectly rounded edges so it is perfect for my fingers that tend to swell in the cold. It look wonderful and feels great and I have worn it since I received it and I always get complements on it as always well done!!!!!"
1,"This ring fits me perfectly and I absolutely love how it looks, the picture doesn't do it justice. I wear it all the time."
0,The ring is beautiful. The quality of the ring however is poor. My husband was wearing the ring for three weeks when he picked up a pebble and was tossing it in his left hand when the ring shattered into five pieces. Hematite is poor quality and should only be worn on special occassions.
0,This ring is very fragile I have only had mine for about 2 weeks and it has broken. Once your ring breaks its gone for good. I was very disappointed when this item broke in two. If it breaks and you want a refund the company Gem Avenue wrote this item is fragile. If you want to wear this ring 24 hours a day or during the day i would not suggest buying it.
1,"I actually wear this ring on top of my other rings that are too large to keep them in place and it looks gorgeous to boot. It's very sturdy. I'm not at all gentle with my jewelry and I can't find a nick on it yet. Still shiny as a pearl! Amazing little ring, I wish hematite came in all colors."
0,"Given the price, my expectations were very low. Those expectations were appropriate. Compared to other CZ jewelry we have lying around, these stones are cloudy, and the silver settings were gray and extremely flimsy.The final product does not resemble the Amazon photo."
1,"I bought this necklace for a close friend who loves dragons, and she wears it every day (except when she's working). She says it gives her a thousand dreams! As she moves through the day strange visions come to her of living in another time, close to the elements. At night, as she shuts her eyes and touched the dragon's head, slumber overtakes her and she feels that she's back in some medieval fantasy along the lines of Robert Jordan's WHEEL OF TIME series.It's an attractive piece, made of sterling silver, and cunningly carved out of silver by expert workmen. Wagner lovers and opera fans in general will want to wear one of those pendants while attending the Ring Cycle live; you'll feel the breath of Fafnir on the back of your neck as you touch the intricate folds and lines of the dragon's glaring face.In his heart a garnet beats and you'll feel the counterpulse of a dagger, gleaming at your side. Looking for a little crystal energy in your life, to counterbalance the ugly planet energies? This is the one dagger pendant necklace that you'll want to have. It's hard to describe the workmanship but frankly, the photo here isn't very good and makes the necklace look like a gimcrack prize from a Cracker Jacks machine. But in actuality it is precious looking and your guy or girl will think you've spent a whole lot of money on them if you give them this ""Forbidden Dragon"" as a birthday present or whatnot. Or if you're a parent with Goth children, trust Kevin, they will be loving you after you give them one of these."
0,This pendant is very small and light - too small and too light. The picture does not reflect reality.
1,I love this necklace. It is VERY STURDY and it is totally worth it. I've had it for about a year or so now and I still love it and it has never broken.
1,I just wanted to let you know that that I was very pleased on the quality and timely fashion that I recieved this product. I purchased this product as a Birthday gift. I plan on purchasing more products from Silver Insanity.Thank you for your good Service.Debbye McGee
1,"if you want to give a personal, high quality item to a loved one....look no further , this bracelet is of high quality & looks more expensive than it is.I would highly recommend it"
1,"Bought it as a gift, caused great impression. Looks classic and delicate. No flaws service, just click, wait two days, go to the mailbox, that's it."
1,"This brazalet is a nice one and its very affordable, i recomend this one if you dont want to spend too much money in a brazalet."
1,I used it to replace a bubble lamp in my rental house. It probably gives off more light and looks just as contemporary.
1,"I ordered this as a gift, and am always wary when ordering jewelry online. I love this! It has a wonderful heavy weight to it, came very nicely packaged in a tarnish resistant bag inside of an Indonesian fabric pouch. The toggle was a concern, as this is a gift for a man, and I was concerned that it may be a bit feminine, but the toggle is a perfect small size and doesn't look like you put a Tiffany bracelet on a guy."
0,"The ring I received wasn't as symmetrical or thick as the one shown on the site. The inner waves are somewhat misaligned where the metal is joined causing it not to spin very well and some force has to be used. After long periods of wear, especially in hot or humid weather, it can leave some staining on your finger. But for the cost that I paid, I really can't expect too much. It is just the image online and the actual product I received have distinctive differences."
1,"Used this when I interned in the Congress, and everyone (including my congressman) loved it:) It's good quality and looks good (better than on the picture)."
0,"I was extremely disappointed in the color of the diamonds. There was a very distinct yellow color, not the ""near colorless"" I expected from an I-J diamond. As mentioned in other reviews, they are pretty lackluster. The good part is that they were very inexpensive so I didn't waste too much money. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,I received an email with diamond stud earrings 30% off. I had already decided to buy some that I had seen at Sam's Club but were 1/4 ct. I bought a better and bigger diamond earring and paid the same price that they were asking at sam's for the smaller diamond. They are great.
1,"Was a little hesitant about ordering earrings online, especially diamonds. However, I am so very pleased with these. Just the right size for the second piercing in my earlobe. The setting is beautiful! They came with a diamond guarantee."
0,"These diamonds are at the bottom of the barrel as far as quality, clarity, cut and so on. Enter the statement may have been treated and they are a bad buy all around. I would feel terrible knowing I bought a diamond that may fall apart on my girlfriend when she cleans them, or if they lose their sparkle due to any coatings, laser drillings that may fall out over time. Do your homework and buy a book ""How to buy a diamond"". You will not regret what you learn about your next purchase on a quality diamond. Insist on non treated stones. They are a worthwhile investment for you or your loved one."
1,"I get compliments all the time on these earrings. These are one of my favorites and to be honest I have started a little collection from this company of assorted earrings. I love all their line of earrings and have bought several different pairs. They are unique, exquisite, dainty and perfect for gifts!"
1,I love Silver Forest earrings. They are comfortable and beautiful. I always get lots of compliments on them and people ask where I got them. I tell them
1,I bought this for my wife and what a nice little item. She wears it all the time. I highly recommend this for anyone shopping for one! 10/10 on this product. Happy shopping!
1,This is the second scale of this type that I have bought for our small laboratory. We have purchased new versions of this scale and I prefer this older model much more.
1,"Beautiful quality, made my wife very happy. If youre looking for an affordable gift, this is it."
1,I have ordered from this company and I am always very pleased with the quality and the speed that my orders arrived.
1,"i really think the band is very stylish, and it fits vry neat...i truely am pleased with my purchase ...i will continue to look at the nice jewlery you guys have to offer....thank you so much for giving very professional service......i appreciate your service..."
0,"These earrings were even prettier 'in person' than in the photo. When I first bought them, I had serious concerns. The hinges seemed to have too much 'play' in them. I also had to bend the prong down gently to get it to slip into the hole. I worried about the earrings falling off, or the hinges falling apart. I've had them for quite a while now, and they have held up just fine. They haven't come open unexpectedly, and they still look beautiful. I'd upgrade the star rating if Amazon would let me!"
1,"good quality product, I recomend for little presents for the people that arrive to the hospital when you baby born"
1,This was a sturdy metal pendant and was perfect for my needs - I mounted it in a frame for a friend. Would have been equally perfect on a chain or silk necklace. Beautiful piece.
1,"I had ordered from Silver Insanity in the past and was pleased with the overall quality, attention to detail, fast shipping and reasonable price. this time was no exception the chain is well made and has an antique look, I bought the 16' choker and was not disappointed with the attention to detail. I'm a very satisfied customer and will continue to order from Silver Insanity."
1,"I got this chain for a pendent i was giving as a gift, the necklace that came with the pendent was a simple rope that didn't really seem right with it, this is an excellent chain and a great price.One thing, i didn't take into account how short 20 inches would be, not a problem as it is a gift for a younger sister, but something to be aware of."
1,Looks like black gold. Lovely necklace to wear alone or with a trinket. I love it..
1,This goes great with the sun pendent I purchased. They set each other off in a complimentry and looks good for every day wear.
0,"The chain is nice enough, but I only got it around the first of December and already the little ring that attaches the chain to the clasp has fallen off and I almost lost the chain AND the pendant I had on it. I would have expected the chain to last longer than 2 months!"
0,"My wife bought this chain. The chain is just ok. It's not as heavy and more 'fragile looking' than she would like. She says she'll wear it but, intends to keep looking for another. The clasp is tiny, she wishes it were larger so it would be easier to open and close."
1,"I love this chain I was a little concerned over purchasing this chain I was not sure about it. I was afraid with it being antiqued a dark chain it would look cheap,but I love it I am glad I went ahead and bought it, it does not look like an old tarnished chain like I was afraid it would, it is unique the chain goes so well with a certain pendant that I have it works perfectly with it. So all I can say about the Antiqued Popcorn Chain is you will not go wrong in ordering it, it is a very nice chain. I ordered the 20"" and it hangs perfect I wanted it to hang low on my chest and it is just right."
0,I ordered this and the 5mm bracelet. I would love it if they made the necklace in a 5mm as this one did not match the bracelet. I will probably give it as a gift rather than return it.
0,I didn't get my order at all and neither the company provided any explanations as to what had happened.
0,"This chain is nice enough, but very thin and flimsy. The detail is not as prominent as the description and picture indicates. The chain is weak and would not hold up to addition of any ""charms"" as I had expected to use it for. From even three feet away, it appears like a bit of hardware store cord, not jewelry."
0,"This is a nice chain to go with my marcasite pendant. It deserves a 3.5 for its price and appearance. I got the 16 inch which works perfectly. However, the chain thickness is a little small. I would've preferred a 3-4 mm chain and that was my fault. I was so excited about the reviews that I overlooked its thickness is 2 mm. Buying the correct length of chain is key. If your neck size is 17"", the absolute shortest length you should buy is a 20"" chain."
1,I loved it! came as described; was well protected and packaged. I would definitely recommend the seller and the way they do business. thank you.
1,"good quality unicorn. very small, so it fits on a chain with a lot of other pendants. Beautiful arftul design"
1,"I was browsing on Amazon one day and realized i have never had any form of my birth stone, I saw this ring and price and I knew I had to have it, it arrived on time and I think it is stunning, absolute perfect design and craftmans ship. I love it and will proudly where it always. Thank you."
0,"From the description/picture I expected more. I knew the diamonds were not great quality, but the settings do not look too great. Also, it is VERY light, in fact it somehow has already bent a little so it is now a little distorted. The measruement and diamond quality was accurate, it just does not look as ""nice"" as the picture. However, delivery time was speedy."
1,I think the customer service was top class. The ring was very nice for the price paid. I am very happy with the whole thing.
0,Too bad smartphones no longer have places to put a charm. I am turning this into a necklace.
0,"Gave ring to daughter for 13th birthday. A Sapphire fell out within two hours of wearing the ring. Called that afternoon 9/17 and was told to ship item priorty mail, insured(shipped 9/18) and a new ring would be mailed immediately upon receipt. Three phone calls later, I have received nothing but a run-around. Today, 10/10 told they never received my package, disputed that based on prior phone calls and insured confirmation, and then finally told that the package has been misplaced and they would have to reprocess a new order. Demanded a full refund and got an arguement. Szul is suppose to send an email confirmation confirming cancellation. I'll hold my breath and going to dispute the charges with my credit card company."
1,"This armoire arrived FAST and in perfect condition. It is just as described. It is large and has so much storage for jewelry. If you don't have that much jewelry, the drawers are large enough to organize something else in the extra space (like make up or scarves or something). The drawers are a great size and pull in and out easily. The top drawer that looks like crown molding is a little slide out that you can put rings in. The armoire comes completely assembled so that was great. I think it was well worth the money! I paid $240."
1,"I have been looking for necklaces like these for a long time, and I had come across this amazing necklace on Amazon.I get compliments daily from people on my necklace; everyone wants to know where I got it from, and I tell them where I got it from, and they say that they're going to look it up and purchase one. That makes me happy to know that not only do I enjoy this lovely piece of jewelry but that others do to!Thank you for selling such a wonderful product that looks beautiful and is durable, and it's just amazing!I will definitely do business again with this retailer, and I will definitely be recommending this place to others!A+! Keep making great and wonderful jewelry as you are, and you will be a huge success!Once again thank you so much!"
1,"Beautiful and intricately designed; this piece is large enough to see the detailing, use the clasp and even slip a prayer inside. Bought this and a Bali chain from Sabrina Silver for my GF and she absolutely loved it! You will not be disappointed with this one!"
1,I love this pendant. I wear it all the time. I'm happy with the quality. I think it's above average. The item was described accurately. I received it in a timely manner. I would recommend it to my friends.
1,This prayer box is VERY WELL made and stunning. It's beautiful. The chain is a bit cheesy though and you might like the prayer box with a black silk cord instead of the silver box chain.
1,"This is a stellar, non-religious, and unique piece of jewelry. The design is perfectly detailed and enhances the product's beauty. It sits at just over and inch tall, but fits perfectly as a neck piece in both size and weight. The parchment I slipped inside stayed dry even when I wore the piece in the shower - the hinged lid closes very tight. If you are looking for an unique piece for your collection, or a prayer/ spell box, I would highly recommend this piece. I absolutely love it."
1,I got exactly what I expected. Seem sturdy enough and they look cute on. I get lots of people take note.
0,"This is a solid, heavy, pretty piece of jewelry. Unfortunately, the length would only fit a child or thin adult."
1,can I specify what kind I want? I'm about to get a surface piercing(2 actually) and I have a lip and belly button piercing. I don't know what I'd do with a eyebrow or tounge ring!
1,"i recieved 10 item 3 belly rings, 3 tongue rings, 2 eyebrow rings, 2 tongue rings. Its not the same as the pics but a great deal some iam good fast shipping."
1,Very quick delivery. All items were very cute at a cheep rate. I love them! Didn't use all the pieces but was able to give some away to friends. :)
0,"I hated everything.I didn't get one thing i liked and nothing fit.On top of that,I only got 9 pieces.well,it is a random thing so oh well.Wont be buying from them again."
0,"I got these because I had also purchased the green peridot which I absolutely adore.... these? The amethyst looked almost ""bleached"" and the two earrings doesnt evne look uniform. Barely even purple at all... I'm a bit disappointed and am still debating if I should keep it or not....I rated it 2 stars just because Amazon does have an awesome return policy and customer service.... and the earrings are okay... just not as pictured and looked like I said... bleached.. =("
1,"I've had my fair share of septum rings, but this is the one I always come back to. It's comfortable to wear either out or flipped up inside the nose to hide during work. I always seem to forget about it when it's flipped up. I like it because it is small. Never been a fan of the actual rings or anything too clunky or big. Buy this if you like small, cute septum tidings. :)"
0,"The Larimar stone is very similar to rings I found in a Texas beach shop, very pretty and the perfect size for me. The ring setting is a little flimsy, it's lightweight and not well cast from the mold. I hope it wears well for a long time. The 7.5 size is true and fits perfectly."
1,I have several pairs of cuff links from Enrico Pardini and they look great and are holding up very well to every use.
0,This is not heavy enough for silver. I will never purchase anything else from this vendor. Very disapointed!!
0,"I think these are ok, but they were very flimsy, thin and light. I rarely wear these, it is not for daily wear because everytime i touch them i feel like they are going to break. The size was great though."
1,"i am very satisfied with my purchase. i used to work in a jewely store and knew how much this particular chain should cost. so, i looked in several jewelry stores before i purchased this necklace (they were pretty pricey in the stores) so i decided to look online thru amazon.com because i have purchased with them before and have had good luck. i will be buying from them again."
0,"CLASP IS GLUED TO LEATHER AND PULLED APPART WHEN TRYING TO RELEASE THE CLASP. CLASP IS AFIXED TO LEATHE BY 1/4 INCH. NO RESPONCE FROM COMPANY, NO REPLACEMENT , NO REFUND. IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. FORGET THE CLASP (NOT SILVER) ORDER LARGER SIZE AND TIE A KNOT IN IT !!!"
1,This particular chain is long enough to put over my head without opening the clasp. I love it. Looks good with all pendants and with tailored or dressy clothes. Thanks for making it available!
1,Needed somthing simple for a charm I purchased for my wife and this was it. Well made
0,"My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace. Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item. As they say, ""you get what you pay for!"""
1,It's a great necklace! I already had a pendant to put on it and it works really well. The price is so reasonable. Other similar necklaces cost three times as much money.
1,It held the necklace I bought for it but was kind of short...would recomend this to a guy who likes necklaces.
1,The ring is just as it looks online. It has retained it's color and shape. Very happy with it!
0,"These little earrings are very cute, they were what I expected. I wanted a pair that would work with some other diamond studs I have. I believe the two together will create a very nice look."
0,the earrings are as explained but the amethyst is far from being the hue that is shown in the picture. buyer beware! the stone looks light pink.
0,"From other reviews,I was expecting the stones on this to be lighter than the picture. However, the stones are almost colorless, barely a hint of the stone color. Otherwise, the earrings are very nice, fasten well and are sturdy."
1,"I had expected to get the same pink stones everyone else is speaking of. The ones in my pair are purple, good quality amethyst. I cannot complain."
1,I get SO many compliments on this ring. A friend asked if I would mind if she bought the same ring. Of course I didn't mind and now she has one too. It's beautiful and just the right size-I was looking for a narrow band type ring for my thumb. LOVE IT~
0,"this looks really nice online...i know....but the belly ring is HUGE( it was so long it touched my pants when i sat down. and i dont recommend this for someone with a new piercing because it is a little heavy. plus, the hearts break off easily. but it looks cute(just cuter on the net trust me)"
1,"Oh my goodness, these are just too cute. Thumbs up to whoever thought of this. I am a very spiritual person and when I saw this I thought oh what a good way to stay reminded to keep my abba's commandments. I bought one and when I got it I ordered two more and I plan on getting a few more. They are good as gifts for the believer. Thank you thank you thank you!!!"
1,"The earrings look very delicate and sparkly, just the right size for a young bride. If only I could find a matching affordable bracelet!"
1,"I only wish these had been a bit larger. However, they are as nice as can be."
0,"This item is nothing like the picture. It looked cheap and felt light weight. One stone was set deeper than the others so it looked off. The stones did not sparkle like they do in the picture. Easy return, but wasted money in shipping both ways. Don't waste your money on this one. I was so disappointed.Update"
1,These earings are beautiful and not flimsy at all. I am really enjoying them.
1,"This ring is so nicely made, I love wearing it. The horse is shaped such that the contours are all on top, so they don't touch the finger. The part that comes over the finger is smooth making it a comfortable wear. Really like the look of this ring."
0,"Sweet little pendant. Wish it had a finished back and a little prettier shade of pink. Gift recepient, 5 yrs. old, loved it."
1,"These are the perfect size. Nice basket setting, very believable. I would buy them again in a heartbeat!"
1,"These are lovely and she appreciated getting them very much. Guys, you can garner some good points with these nice earrings."
1,"Ok! So here goes my first review and on jewelry. This was a gift along with the matching necklace for my boyfriend who tried on the same product at a farmer's market recently... this is stunning. I had to return it only because I miscalculated his wrist size. 9 is average I believe, nevertheless it was a nice weight without looking pimpish but enough 'pop' to notice a nice piece. LOVE it on him my only regret is why I never treat myself to such nice pieces. HA. Thanks, I will be back."
1,The chain was exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality. I would shop from this seller again.
1,my mother got me this for my sixteenth birthday with the red in the middle for my birthstone. i wear it almost every day. im almost 18 now and i get compliments on it all the time. :) timeless piece.
1,this item shiped on time and I had no problem with the seller or item
1,"I love sparkle on my ankle..this fit beautifully around my ankle. Finally an ankle bracelet that is noticed and very sexy. Nice clasp on it too. I never take off. I do have small ankles and this fits exact to a size 10"" approx. Very impressed with this. Very affordable and comfortable! Nice product. I'm almost tempted to have one on each ankle"
0,"i got this for a valentines day present and within 20 min of wearing it, the clasp broke and is unrepairable. LOL it was more funny than anything else. it does somewhat feel cheap because you can see the melding on the inside of the pendant. i got another bracelet that was cheap and from amazon and it broke later that day when i tried to take it off. so i received two pieces of cheap sterling silver jewelery from amazon that broke in the same day. in this case i would say you get what you pay for. they have the exact same design at tiffanys, if you want one guaranteed to not break on you."
1,This is a beautiful lightweight necklace perfect to wear with any type of clothing. Indexpensive for its look and great. Only problem is that similar ones have been released by other companies too and it appears often loosing its' speciality in appeal. Overal very beautiful though.
0,"For the price I paid for this item, I expected something a little bigger. The size of the heart was hardly larger than a pencil eraser. If you plan to put a photo in here, it will be so tiny you will won't be able to see a thing. It's unfortuate that Amazon doesn't give you something to compare it to prior to ordering it.. if it had, I would not have bought it. I gave it three stars primarily because my disappointment with the size."
0,"I, too, foolishly didn't pay attention to the listed demensions or the reveiws.It's pretty but as tiny as your finger nail. And one would need a magnifying scope to view any pictures that would fit in this miniature locket."
0,"They sent the wrong belly ring, i wasted my money on expedited shipping."
0,"I received the item faster than I thought I would, and was excited about getting it, but was disappointed when I opened it because it looked better in the pitcure. I intend on returing it. Darn."
1,"The product came nicely packaged for giving as a gift and so far is holding up quite well, even while being adjustable. My friend loves starfish, so this was really cute to give her!"
1,"these earrings are very nice, look just the same as on the computer very pleased with this purchase."
1,i bought these as a little gift for my fiancee...she adores them and they look fantastic...highly recommend this for silver and tanzanite lovers...i will buy from this company repeatedly
1,"Very nice earrings, and not too large of a hoop. Glad I purchased them! I was looking for a pair of earrings to match my ring, and these were the perfect fit."
1,I put together a lucky charm bracelet for a friend this was a perfect addition. Cute arrived on time & seems well made. She loves it
1,Round Cut Citrine Flower Earrings Sterling SilverThese earrings are lightweight so pleasant to wear...the design is unusual and the stones are bright and pretty. Am always quite satisfied with items purchased from Peora.
1,"Okay, so this is actually the logo of a metal band from the early 80s called Queensryche. How do I know this? Because a fan saw me wearing this and asked me if I was into them, considering that I wasn't even born when they came out.The piece itself looks great. It's not 100% symmetrical, but that doesn't bother me because it seems hand-crafted. It does make good conversation, and I love wearing it outside a t-shirt or at the beach when I'm bare-chested. Just don't wet the cord or you'll have a hard time adjusting it, which may mean having to leave it on/off while it dries."
1,"The pendant design was interesting, and the wormanship was excellent. The price was very good, and delivery was as promised."
1,The Venetian glass in this pendant has great dept and color. The pendant is a work of art as well as a piece of jewelry
1,I read the reviews on this diamond just before Christmas when it was on sale for $99.00. The diamonds are better then expected and I consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks. No visible flaws. I am sure if I used a loop I could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair. Their great for $99.00 diamonds.
0,"I rated these earrings a three because while they aren't the clearest and have a little color to them, they are 14k And a pretty decent size for the price."
0,We thought there was some kind of mistake when we opened the box- they're so cloudly/lacking in clarity that they don't even look like diamonds. Put the $99 you would have spent towards a good pair- I wish I had.
0,I am very pleased with the delivery and appearance of my product. I was impressed by the price and quality.
0,I was sorely disappointed with this product. The earrings were extremely cloudy and lacked the presentation that I expected.
0,"These diamonds are a great gift until your wife/girlfriend/lover opens the box to find diamonds that look more like old ice than diamonds. They are black in nature and cloudy at best. But, like the above said, they go on your ears, so who realy cares?Don't buy them is my advice!!"
0,"CZ's look much better than these unsightly stones. I looked at the reviews and did some homework on the diamonds. It turns out that I2-I3 are bottom of the barrell compared to flawless. Add to the fact that the disclosure of treatments,(laser drilling,coatings,baking,radiation, or doublets) and you can very well get a pair that looks even worse as you clean them in your sonic cleaner. I would not advise anyone who knows what to look for in a diamond these earings, or any other that has a warning statement of being treated to enhance clarity. Buyer beware. Buy the book, ""How to buy a diamond"" by Fred Crueller and never get ripped off by online sellers."
0,"i was not disappointed and i wasn't impressed with this item. i won't return it, but i won't wear the earrings alone. they will remain in my second hole. these earrings are perfect for that. and if i get tired of them, i will give them to my 10 year old niece."
0,"The product was not as nice as the picture looks, but I guess you get what you paid for."
0,"Most items I purchase on Amazon, I have been very pleased with. Please save your time and money and pass these by, backings were loose and you would probably loose one moments after putting on, very poor clarity. All in all what could you expect for just $99.00."
1,"I ordered two of these necklaces and despite the fact that 2x$30 turned into over a hundred overnight(taxes and a whopping canada customs charge upon delivery), the product was exactly what I wanted and packaged so nicely that I will be ordering more for gifts as well as the matching earrings."
1,"I got this chain, so that I could have a ""chain of reference"" for a necklace I wanted to get for my husband's birthday (we had a gift certificate to a jewler, and I didn't know the name of the genre of chain linkage we sought) and during a search, I found this! Exactly what we needed! His birthday gift is here, in perfect 14k gold, so now I get to play with the stunt double chain...nobody can tell the diference between them until we show them the name&karat franking on his chain! Just plain WOW! Good going Sabrina Silver!"
1,I think the coin pendant is very nice and I bought it for a gift for my brother-in-law. It is very well done and attractive. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,THIS IS A VERY PRETTY CHARM BRACELET. I WILL WEAR THIS ONE A LOT.THIS IS A MUST HAVE
1,I bought the lil sis and big sis charms for my nieces who are about to have girl number 5 join the family. They were extremely pleased with them. They came in a timely manner after I ordered them and seemed to be in great condition. The girls had them on their bracelets that night and had already started one for the baby sis. Makes a great gift for including sisters in a baby shower.
1,Looks exactly like the picture. Very nice quality. A must for everyone who is a Tiger fan and owns an Italian Charm Bracelet.
1,"A must have for a teenage Goth who has everything else. Plus, his skull earrings along with this pewter ring completed his ensemble. Neat gifts for the price- can't beat it..."
1,I have several of these chains from this vendor; all are top quality and reasonably priced.
1,Bought this set for my 14 year old grand daughters birthday. The set is beautiful and she loved it.
1,I love the set! For the price it was more than I expected. Great Job!
1,"This is the first time I have bought something like this on the internet. I wasn't really sure what I would get, but I was very pleased with the item. It is exactly what was advertised, the colors are lovely, and not a scratch on them. I will be looking for more vintage items again."
1,I love the earrings and want to order them but does anyone know if there is a matching necklace that goes with these earrings?
0,I bought this locket and it got sent to me broke does not stay clasped...I do not recommend this seller they have not responded to me for almost week. Poor service should be ashamed of themselves. Thanks for wrecking my valentines present!
1,Very satisfied with this amazing ring! it's just too cute and sparkles a lot!..buy it and you won't regret.
1,I really like this ring and have gotten compliments on it - the price is reasonable too. Good quality.
1,This is a great ring! I got it very quickly and it is shinier and prettier than the picture. I plan on getting another one.
1,"Bought at Christmas as a present, I was very happy with the very quick shipping, the well padded packing, and the quality of the ring- all at very inexpensive pricing. I highly recommend this."
0,Not as advertised - this product looks and feels like costume adornments. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,"Love my ring! Works perfectly as a temporary wedding band! Exactly as promised! I have been wearing them every day since I received them at the end of May and there is no tarnishing. Also I love that it doesn't turn my finger green - I can wash dishes, shower, wash my hands and not have to worry about my finger looking moldy! Love it!"
1,"I bought this ring because I'm pregnant and my wedding rings no longer fit. It's comfortable, looks great and I love having a ring to wear when I go out!"
1,Bought the ring for my girlfriend! I gave it 2 her easter day!! I put the ring inside of an egg and gave it 2 her!! She loved it!! =D Very pleased!
0,"Hated this thing as soon as I opened it. Not nearly as ""shiny"" as it was in the pic and the stones don't sparkle at all. The ring looks dull, plating has chipped off in some places and the stones look terrible (always have though).I ended up going to Khols and getting a ring for $10 that is much more attractive and people actually ask if its real.It amazes me that there are so many people who love this item; maybe I just got a dud or they have never gotten a ring out of one of those quarter machines and think this thing is great.."
1,"Well,I honestly thought the ring is beautiful.While I was looking for a ring to buy here on Amazon.com,I saw the ring I bought and I thought it looked beautiful and lovely so I bought the ring.:)"
0,"I've waited a few weeks to post this because I wanted to see how the ring held up. I've worn it maybe 10 times and it seems to be holding up ok. However the stones in the ring have very little sparkle and don't really show up well. They are a decent size and the ring itself is very realistic looking but there is no life to the ring. It is most likely due to the princess cut of the stone which has very little light refraction. I should have stuck with the round stones and I'm sure I would have been happier. All in all, the ring is good just not exactly what I was looking for."
1,i ordered this ring due to the fact i had lost weight and didn't have the money for a real diamond band. I was surprised when i got the band that it looked so real.The diamonds looked like real diamonds. No one could tell the difference!!I highly recommend this ring!! It has not changed color and it looks like platinum.
1,"These came in the most beautiful packaging, I can't wait to give them to my kids. I just got married and I have 2 kids, these are going to be their ""wedding bands""!! I can't think of a more precious gift!"
1,"I really love the band. I bought one for me and a men's ring for my husband of 20 years! However, this is now the 3rd time I am writing a review for the same product. Not sure why I'm asked to review again."
1,"During my pregnancy, I was sad to find that my rings no longer fit. I bought this ring largely based on the positive reviews and the fact that it looks essentially just like my wedding band.I was not disappointed. The ring looks beautiful, and I feel confident wearing it. I can tell it's not real just by comparing it to my wedding ring, but I don't believe anyone else would ever guess without detailed scrutiny. I also am glad I don't have to worry about the plating coming off and the ring looking brassy since the sterling silver ring with rhodium plating keeps a shiny, white gold appearance, just like my real ring.The 4MM size was bigger than I expected but not a problem since I have slightly larger hands. The price was right, and I'm very happy with the ring."
1,"Received my ring in record time in a beautifully packaged box, and it is absolutely gorgeous! Looks just as it is pictured. Very clear and shiny, and a perfect fit!! Both my original rings were stolen during a recent business trip, so I have been looking for a ""replacement"" ring, while we wait to purchase my 10th anniversary ring later this year. This was an absolutely perfect choice!"
0,"The packaging was suprisingly pretty it came in a heart shaped box with a bow. The ring in itself was very beautiful and fit perfectly albiet a few centimeters bigger than a regular 8 the only problem is the beauty only lasted about 2 maybe 3 weeks then the ""silver"" looked like a cheap imitation with no sparkle or brilliance as in the first few days.The shipper though was wonderful it arrived much faster than expected and I experienced no problems with that. Sadly the ring is sitting on my counter in its original box now and has been reduced to a fond memory."
1,"I received my ring one day earlier than I was expecting it. It came in a very cute little box with bow. The ring is gorgeous and fulfilled my expectations. I love it! It is very classically beautiful, sparkly and comfortable. I cannot imagine paying such a small price for this ring. Very pleased!"
1,"Beautiful ring! It arrived in 4 days, once we opened the box we were speechless! It's a great ring especially for the price. It looks slimmer than in the picture but its great it sparkles like the real thing. I would definitely recommend this product!"
0,"Looks great and a good deal, but placing of the stones could be better. One of the stones looked like it was jammed in so the housing is scraped and the stone seems out of place. Like the way it fits and looks good, but would not buy again."
0,"My fianc&eacute;e and I were going to be married in two weeks and we didn't have enough money for the diamond ring we wanted. We put $100 down on layaway and came over to Amazon to get an inexpensive placeholder.I have always been a fan of cubic zirconia, believing that if you put a zirconium (?) and a diamond side by side the zirconium will always sparkle better. And because of the one reviewer who talked about social consciousness I was secretly hoping that this ring would be so beautiful that we'd skip getting the diamond ring and just keep this one. (But you know how women are, they have to deal with all the people who are going to ask them if those are real diamonds or not.)So there we were, me with my secret hopes, when the box arrived in the mail. I waited until I picked her up from work to give it to her. We were in the car on an overcast day when we opened it. And we slowly opened the box, hoping for sparkling brilliance, and it just lay there, dead. Not a single sparkle off a single ""diamond."" The metal, however, was surprisingly shiny. Way too shiny. It looked like painted plastic. If this wasn't bad enough we both immediately noticed a small dent!!!!!!! right on the top of the metal, right by the gemstones. There was no way that this dent could have occurred in the box; they had to have shipped it out this way. But wait, on closer inspection, there were TWO dents. They seemed like they could be made simply by pressing a thumbnail into the ring, though I was afraid to try this because I didn't want to add another flaw to the ring.We moved the ring around, covering it with our hands, and could never get the gems to sparkle. It was a huge disappointment. I wonder if we even got the same ring that everyone else got. I wonder if we just got cut glass or something.Oh, I forgot another flaw, one of the gems was just slightly off, so when you look at the faces of the gems, one always has a different look. Not noticeable from a distance really, but upon inspection.So she is still wearing the thing (we got married on the 14th of feb 2010) and it is a disappointment every time I see it. It is always, always dead. (I originally hoped that the overcast day had something to do with the lack of sparkle.) There has been only a single lighting condition, one time, when it sparkled. It got my hopes up, (""Hey, it's not so bad,"" I said), but that was it, died after that and has never come back to life.The questions I'm left with are"
1,"The ring is beautiful!! It fits perfectly and it's very light. I love it! It took a while for me to get the ring, but it was worth it."
1,I was very pleased to see that this product looks exactly like in picture and even better.
0,"The ring I received from seller Gem Avenue looks like a cheap knock-off the beautiful ring in the picture. Had I received a ring looking similar to the picture I would have been satisfied. The ring I received has a metal rim around the garnet. The picture in the ad shows a ring with a prong setting, the ring I received has a cheap cracker box metal lip with a seam at the top and bottom holding the stone in place. Very disappointing after the great reviews I read."
1,"Stunningly beautiful ring. I would definitely buy more items from this company. Great price, too."
1,"I really am enjoying this bracelet (which I just received this week) - the 5.5 mm width is great for me - it shows the pattern on the herringbone and the shine of the silver to great advantage. The bracelet fits well and it's very comfortable. I love that Sabrina Silver has bracelets in 7 inch lengths, which are getting rare in silver. I highly recommend it."
1,It's beautiful and just what I wanted. Shipping was fast. So far I have had no problems with it.
0,"We bought this wedding bands because we were in a rush. We decided in a Saturday to go next weekend to Vegas to get married and we need it something fast and cheap.For using a couple of months are fine, but they got scratched pretty fast, doesn't look as good anymore, and I'm working at a computer all day long. So I think you should buy something with more karats."
1,Its Awsome My Mother Loves It Thank You Very Much I Love The Product Its Awsome
0,"The bracelet is nice, I gave it to my wife for Christmas. She opens the box, and the bracelet was broken, not cool! Thank goodness for the easy Amazon return policy."
1,my sister had got my mother the necklace a few years ago. now she has the matching set and loves it
1,This order of a herringbone necklace was quickly fulfilled and the merchandise is wonderful!! Many compliments have been received for this gift - from total strangers. Good job.
1,"I love this piece!!! The value is out of this world. You have to see it to believe the beauty. I am very pleased and excited, I am wearing this for my wedding and am very proud to. Fast shipping as well!!!"
1,Everything came just like it was described and it arrived well within the date I was expecting it. Great experience.
1,These lovely earrings can be combined with a pendant to provide a beautiful gift for the mother and child sharing February and August birthdays. Not too pricey but worth a mint of memories!
1,I REALLY LOVE MY EAR RINGS AND WHAT A GREAT BUY! THANK YOU AMAZON
1,"Very pretty hoops, really with intense a blue one, the very good quality, are small and delicate, are beautiful, very recommendable very elegant."
1,"I had a hard time finding an affordable curb chain that wasn't too chunky with the right design. Most of the smaller chains seemed overpriced for their size, or look bad. I looked around for a long time at jewelers and other websites, and this is the best deal I found. The seller delivered the item overnight (which was impressive to me), and I received the item about three days after placing the order. The item is exactly as advertised and even better in person than I imagined. I would definitely buy again from this seller."
1,The color of the stones is much brighter and prettier than the picture shows. I love these earrings! It was exactly what I was looking for.
1,"These high quality well made earrings are smaller than a dime. The stones continue on the bottom of the earrings, but there are not stones inside the back (in other words they are not an inside/out design). Instead there is a nice scroll design on the backside of the loop.I'm very pleased with my purchase. I do wish they were larger or that amazon offered the same earring in a larger hoop size."
1,These were purchased for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift. My grandson's birthstone is amethyst and I wanted her to have a pair of earrings in his stone. They were so lovely I almost kept them for myself.
1,"I bought these for my twenty-something sister-in-law... she loved them and put them on right away. They ARE small, so be aware; she is tiny with delicate features, and usually only wears stud earrings, so they were perfect on her. These would be too small for someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings.There is a bit of space between the stones and the metal that doesn't really show in the pictures, but it's nothing you notice once they are on. In all, a great value!"
1,I waited until these babies were on sale for nearly half off and then bought them for a gift..My wife really loves them so that's all that matters!
1,"I love these earrings. They are beautifully made, small (but that's what I wanted), elegant, very comfortable for every day wear. Thank you Amazon!"
1,"These earrings are comfortable, well crafted, have nice color and perfect for casual to dressed up attire. As other reviewers noted;these earrings are on the petite side. I find the size to be a plus since they are 14k gold and still light weight for my sensitive ears. I'm thinking about buying a couple more pairs of these with other gemstones."
0,if I wanted mediocre quality for this price I could've gone to virtually any jewelry store. I thought one of the advantages of shopping on Amazon was a better deal. I guess when it comes to shopping for jewelry I'll stick with my local gemologist.
0,Earring are very grey in color and of poor quality. No sparkle at all. Would not recomend purchasing. Ended up returning.
0,"They look cool and are a fun design. However, the bonding on the back of one of them came off without much stress being put on it rendering it useless Even for $30, they seem like low quality. The site lists only a 90-day warranty against defects. If you are looking for some cufflinks you can wear more than say 5-10 times, I would look elsewhere. I think I only got about 5 days use out of them. Even at $30, that's $6 for each wear."
1,The detail was beautiful. I have been looking for a pair of these cufflinks for some time now. The price was great too.
0,"I purchased this by the picture what we got was junk all scratched up dull, no cut design. JUNK"
0,"Wow, what a disappointment. I must have paid $34 for the gold posts and backs because the turquoise balls look like they are worth 50 cents. They look like cheap blue plastic balls. I don't see how anyone could rate this anything above a one star."
0,"The earrings look just like the photo. I think I expected the turquoise to look more authentic. I purchased for my daughter who is allergic to silver earrings, so I will go ahead and give them to her anyway (and not return), but I don't think these are really that great."
1,"The ring is a little bigger so it isn't really an 'everyday' ring. But it is still very pretty, with a simple setting. If you really like the Asscher cut in diamonds, and can't have the real thing right now...this is a nice alternative! I got the necklace and earrings too so the set is really nice. I can wear the earrings/necklace everyday. The ring is great for an evening out. Good company, excellent customer service."
1,"I love peridot so I may be a little biased yet this pendant is just gorgeous. However, be prepared that it is tiny."
1,"An anklet can be a sexy addition to your wardrobe, drawing the eye to your footwear, and giving that hint of the exotic. This crystal and bead anklet provides a nice combination of subtlety and provocativeness. With its pretty coloring, this anklet looks excellent with both sandals and bare feet.Ladies, during those intimate moments, when less clothing is the name of the game, jewelry comes into its own, and nice anklets (such as these) are a must!(Review of STRETCH CRYSTAL & HEISHI BEAD ANKLET CLEAR AB)"
0,"This anklet is very pretty and the description matches the product. However, it does not stretch as much as I had hoped. I got it in the largest size, which is an 11. I like anklets that I can just slip on and off. I don't want to fuss with a clasp. I am of average weight, but seem to need larger size anklets and was hoping this one had more give. I can't wear in on my ankle as it is too tight, but wear it on my wrist, like a bracelet. It is too big for my wrist, but I wear it with several other bracelets, which keeps it from falling off. The crystals sparkle and the black beads look very fancy with the crystals. I will keep looking for a stretchy, pull on anklet for this summer. The product was shipped very quickly and packaged very carefully. I will look for more products from this seller that will meet my needs."
1,Great selection of all types jewelry. I love the stretch ankelet. So much easier to put on than the typical anklets. I will be shopping this site again.
1,"I am so glad that I bought this jewelry armoire. Not only is it beautiful, but it holds all of my jewelry in one place. It has shallow drawers for earrings and smaller accessories and deep drawers for chunky bracelets and beads, too. Very nicely made and sturdy. I highly recommend it!"
1,This Jewelry Armoire is absolutely GORGEOUS! It is even more beautiful than the picture. It has amazing detail & superb workmanship. Amazon's packaging and 3-day delivery was outstanding. And the price was more than competitive. What a PERFECT purchase! Thank you Amazon!!!
0,The earrings I got ARE NOT the same as presented in the picture. What I got is of a cheaper quality and they are not what I want at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy these earrings. A waste of good money.
1,"I love the bracelet, but the length wasnt the right size for a larger male. It barely fit my wrist, but I wear it all the time. I get a lot of compliments.l"
1,"These earrings are rather larger than I expected, a little bit larger than a nickel in circumference. The stones are gorgeous however. They're so dark that they look black unless they're in strong direct light, then they're a lovely clear red. All in all they are quite lovely, but if you're looking for something delicate or small, these might not be for you."
1,Gave these to my daughter for Valentine's day. She loves them!! They are too cute!! She has gotten many compliments on them. She is only 7 so I changed the backs to a different style so the stems wouldn't poke her when she sleeps in them.
1,tHIS RING IS UNIQUE AND GORGEOUS.I BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF AND AM REALLY PLEASE WITH IT.IT LOOKS BETTER IN PERSON THAN IN THE PICTURE.I HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL COMPLIMENTS ON IT.THE BAND IS QUITE COMFORTABLE AND NOT TOO THICK.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY DUTY RING YOU SHOULDN'T GET THIS RING BECAUSE THIS IS QUITE DELICATE AND FEMININE.IT IS NOT CHEAP IN APPEARANCE AND IS OF GOOD QUALITY.RECOMMENDED.
1,"Excelent quality and finishing on this item , silver is well polished as well as stones on it , perfect for a gift . I will use it on a wooden box im making , purchase two of them since i loved the first one that arrived , packing also very good."
1,"I bought my wife several hummingbird pendants for Christmas and she loved them all! She'll be going to Fla for a month or so and will be taking them along. Meanwhile, I'll be stuck up here in the UP, but I can live with that."
1,"I bought this for a friend who is a two time breast cancer survivor. She was absolutely delighted! This is a simple, but beautiful way to remind someone that they are special - and a survivor."
0,"I purchased these for my mother for christmas, when I received them they were really small for a grown women, child size really. I had absolutely no problem with returning them and getting a refund, minus the $ 3.95 shipping. I was very, very impressed with how efficient amazon handled my return and how quickly I received my refund, within two weeks. I will diffenitly continue to shop with amazon, however, I will be a little more cautious and read the description a little slower."
1,I bought these for our daughter and she wears them constantly. She's very happy with them.
0,"I liked the necklace it was pretty, but it broke the first day i wore it. I tried to fix it but i think i t is unrepairable..."
0,"looks beautiful out of the bag but it broke twice already and even though my beau fixed it both times, I am very leery of wearing outWill return this"
0,"This amber colored pendant with glass beadings arrived quickly, it was packaged very nicely and is a nice size for open shirts, but it looks as plastic as it is, dull, not shiny. I wouldn't buy it again if I had known it was this cheap looking. I gave it to my grandaughter for her dolls."
1,This necklace is beautiful and looks wonderful on. It is very different from anything I have ever seen. I love it!
1,This was a great product for the price! I bought 7 of these mirrors for my husband's administrative staff and took them to be engraved. The mirrors were beautiful and durable. I compared this mirror with others and by far this was the best.
1,I just received this ring and it is gorgeous. The weight of the sterling and the quality of the craftsmanship is unbelievable and for such a fabulous price.I will buy from this company again and again!
1,This bracelet was exactlly right
1,"My fiance and I couldn't be more impressed with the ring, we got it in plenty of time, and it was just what he wanted."
1,"I'm very pleased with the design and quality of this ring. It's a perfect fit and feels comfortable on my finger. However, the photo adds reflections to the gold band section of the ring, there is no engraving on it. Delivery was via Fedex and came much sooner than expected."
1,Beautiful iridescent stones and intricate silver work. Fits very well and the clasp is easy to work. Very well made.
1,"Had insomnia and decided to go to the Amazon and see what caught my eye. I had to look at this one it reminded me of a Gemini necklace I had before in high school.You can guess, ordering jewelry online is tricky but after all ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained"".Took no longer than I had hoped and was very happy with the condition on arrival very nice puffy jewel box case and a mount. Now I am reminded again of the piece that I mnentioned this is just the same almost albeit a little smaller. It is very elegant, delicate and hollow and has a very sparkly sheen to it I love it, it is even more beautiful than the product shown on the page and makes a good fashion statement without being too flamboyant.All in all, I recommend highly"
1,"I bought several of this company's bracelets because of the great prices for semi precious jewels. All of them have been beautiful and have held up well. I would not recommend them, however, for anyone with larger than an average size wrist. In fact the smaller ones, like the one above, might even be best for someone with a wrist of 7 1/2 "" at most."
1,This pendant is gorgeous. It is well designed and the onyx stone is bright and beautiful. It can hold any size chain.I am most pleased with this purchase.
1,"My wife knew what she was getting for Christmas, a nice gold bangle (she loves bangle style bracelets). It was nice, but she knew it was under the tree.No real surprise there.I surfed my favorite on-line shopping place (Amazon.com) hoping to find that little extra something.What I found surprised me.I found that I could get a beautiful pair of diamond pave earrings without having to go into debt.I found the proper pronunciation of pave - it's ""pah-vaey.""I found that after all these years I can still give my wife a wonderful surprise on Christmas morning.I found that it was my turn to be the hero.It's good to be the hero. . ."
1,"This is a beautiful piece of solid silver jewelry. Well constructed and spins without burrs or sticking points. It is very pretty, and a wonderful addition to my wardrobe. A lovely pendant that I will treasure always."
1,"Since I just recently began to explore Eastern philosophy, and have been reading about Tantra concepts, I wanted a necklace that either had the Om symbol or the Yin-Yang symbol. I got both! The necklace is good quality, has a chain that is just the right length for me, and has a very clever spinning middle, so I can wear either the Om side or the Yin-Yang side by just flipping it over. I especially like the delicate, intricate scrolled design. If only I could find matching earrings!"
1,I bought this as a gift. Very well made and even more attractive in person. I am very pleased and so was the recipient.
1,"It got here fast. Not only that, it was just as decribed online. I love it!"
1,"We ordered two rings on a Monday and received them on Thursday! What great service. The rings are exact size, so I am glad we had our sizing done twice. They are really beautiful and believe even better than the picture reflects!"
1,"I am totally pleased w/ the ring I received and would not hesitate to order from this company again. The quality was excellent. I was afraid it might not arrive in time for Christmas as it was coming from Canada and wasn't shipped until a week before, but it was sent Fedex overnight."
0,"This is a cute pendant, but it is extremely small, also the length of the necklace was not long enough."
1,"I get a lot of complaments on the heart and key pendent. I have been looking for one for a while, and this one I saw on someone else and then I knew it was the one."
1,i was surprised at the quality of these earrings. I love them and will do Business with this company again. Barb
1,These are so cute. I have lots of Zarah earrings because they're so colorful and fun.
1,Just what I was looking for! Very nice! I ordered it as a Confirmation gift for my niece because it symbolized her chosen Bible verse. She made the connection immediately and was so surprised . . . absolutely loved it!
1,"This pendant is good quality, but smaller than the picture. It is a simple piece of jewelry, which is my style, and it came in a little box with a short chain. I would buy it again if I needed to."
1,I just started an add a link bracelet. I can't really afford to buy the expensive charms so I bought a couple from Pugster and a couple of cheaper ones from a store in the mall. The quality of the pugster charms is really really good and the detail is amazing. The cheaper ones I bought at the mall fell apart within 10 minutes of me adding them to my bracelet so it was really a waste of money trying to save money.
1,"This item was received faster than anything else I've ordered from Amazon - and it came across the country. Nice packaging, nice item. Would definitely order from them again."
1,"I bought this as part of a birthday gift for my mother, it came in a very timely manner in excellent condition. I will continue to use this seller as I am completely satisfied with their service. :D"
0,"Supposedly sterling silver; however, when I had the heart engraved, the engraving 'popped' out indicating it was probably not sterling silver...."
1,The article is a cheap replica but I can't complain about the price. You're getting what you're paying for =P
1,"I don't usually like very petite rings, but I do like this one. While the stone is small, it has great color and clarity. It makes a great stacking ring if you would so desire. Very nice ring."
1,The piece is perfect. It is exactly what was stated and is an eye catcher. Item did arrive within the time frame allocated. You will not be disappointed by a purchase from this seller.
0,From the pictures I expected a more substantial setting for all the earrings. The earrings look small and the details of the setting are lost. I already have better sets and will be returning these.
1,"Am always borrowing certain color earrings from my daughter and then realized neither of us had any blue gemstone earrings. Instead of going shopping at a store where I knew I would pay more than I wanted, I checked Amazon. Am also hesitant to buy jewelry online as I like to see what I am getting. But after reading all the reviews, I decided to order this set. I am very happy as I have things to wear every color with!! My daughter also loved them and immediately borrowed the blue ones to wear!! Another thing I like about this set is that each pair has a different shape to the gemstones. Often see sets with different colors in the stores around Christmas but they are all the same size and shape. I like having them be different. Where else could I get five different pair of earrings for this price?? Will be wearing them often and loaning them to my daughter as well."
0,"Blue topaz is practically colorless. Amethyst is a bit paler than on the photo, other items are nice. Overall I am satisfied because the price is OK even if I get only 3 out of 5 which are useful."
1,"One of the things I love about Amazon is the ability to read a review before you buy.The reviews on these earrings are right on target. I'm so glad I bought them!The cut, color, clarity, and shape of the stones are excellent. As illustrated the cuts are different for each pair, that's a nice touch. So far I have worn all but the Blue Topaz and I've received compliments on all of them.My good friend playfully grabbed my earlobe when I wore the Citrine set and said, ""Hmm, I thought you were on a budget...looks like that resolution didn't take."" Hahahah, I am on a budget, if she only knew how much I paid for them. I actually bought these with my new allowance, best money ever spent.She also thought they were platnium, I just smiled and shrugged my shoulders. One thing you might not catch from the pictures, these are nice sized stones. They are large and in charge and definitely going to get noticed.This would make a great gift in part or whole. Better yet, buy them for yourself, it's the best deal you'll ever get on jewelry."
1,"When I purchased these earrings as a gift for my wife, I was very concerned about the negative reviews. Despite the majority of reviews being very positive, a few key negative reviews indicated how large the settings were and how much they might make a woman's earlobes ""droop.""I can safely say they were completely off on this one. My wife is very thin and has delicate features. The earrings look amazing on her, and there is none of the problems pointed out in the negative reviews.The quality of the gems is beautiful, as well. The colors match the images, and in many cases, the images actually don't do the gems justice. Some have complained about the garnet being too dark, but I found the garnets were a beautiful deep red. Actually lighter than in the photos.If you are purchasing these earrings for someone over the age of 80, then maybe I would say buyer beware. Otherwise, please buy these as a gift for someone. They will love them"
1,I purchased this set for myself when it appeared on Amazon's Lightning Deals shortly before Christmas. The stones and the settings in this collection are beautiful and appear to be of very high quality. I was concerned that the posts on these earrings might be too short (I have had this experience quite often when purchasing less expensive earrings) --- happily the posts are of sufficient length! The earrings are comfortable and secure!
1,These were an early Christmas present and the wife loved them. There's not much to say really. You get exactly what's pictured bundled in plain little cardboard jewelry boxes.
1,"The earrings are nice. Two of them had slightly bent back parts, but that's easily fixable. They're nice looking too. The red is really dark, so it'll appear more as a black when you have it on. Looks nice anyways. Good deal."
1,Loved these earrings. The stones were larger than I expected and very clear. The amethyst is a little pale but still a lovely color.
1,"This is an amazing price for 5 pair of nicely sized genuine gemstone earrings. Whether you keep all 5 pair for yourself, or break up the set to give as gifts, it is a terrific buy. I am very pleased with my purchase and wear a pair nearly every day. The stones are cut in different shapes and are in substantial settings. They were a gift to myself for having begun an exercise program that I am diligently sticking to. A nice reward."
1,These are amazing earrings ~ love all the colors & different shapes of the stones ~ so comfortable to wear!
1,"Incredible product for an incredible price, very attractive I really love them...Thank you so much for such a wonderful product."
1,They are good quality earrings and I really love them. They made a great Christmas gift and added some nice pieces to my earring collection.
1,"Are you kidding me? These are fantastic! The price is almost too good to be true. They arrived in 5 separate boxes. The stones are substantial and gorgeous. Will definitly buy from this seller again, quality earrings!!!!!"
1,Ear rings were for my daughter and they were beautiful. She also received the matching necklaces from another relative. So classy.
0,"The colors were not as shown in the picture. We didn't get a blue topaz stone; instead we got a dark, almost, emerald green stone. The other stones are just not a deep in color as shown. The earrings appeared to be well set and not loose in the setting. All in all, we were pleased based upon price and content."
1,I purchased these on a lightning deal for $35. They are for a birthday present. The stones look very clear and the colors are good. They are a little larger than I thought. Nice size stones. I would have believed someone if they told me that they paid $35 for each pair. We'll see how she likes them tomorrow.
1,"Cute earrings, great price! I like the choice of colors, and the fact that each pair comes in a seperate box, which is a great idea for gift giving. These are heavier, not tiny, so they show up great. Some reviews state that these do not work well with some lobes, but I am lucky that I am able to wear earrings without sagging or drooping. I do have sensitvie ears, and have been able to wear them all day & night without any irritation. My ears are double pierced, these work well in either site."
1,I bought this set over a year ago and I love it. They are great for trips and everyday use. The silver is so good and the posts never bend. What a great value.
1,Loved the quality and different cuts on each different gemstone but wished they were individually boxed or mounted on an earring card for nicer gift giving purposes.
1,"Finally! Something that's worth its price! I have bought a lot of jewelries online and I've come to accept that most of them do not appear as good as the photos but this one is just extraordinary! The gems don't look a small as I expected them to be and it even looks better when worn. Each of the five earrings is encased in a cute black box so I didn't have to worry about buying extra cases. I especially love the garnet pair because of its rich red hue. It doesn't look dark and blackish like other garnet-mounted earrings are. It's also an ideal gift if you plan on buying jewels for someone special without spending a hefty sum. The great thing about is that I can wear it everyday for work, and choose between the darker shades to be worn at dinner parties and night outs."
1,"These earrings are beautiful. They are a bit paler than pictured, but the scrollwork on the sides is elegant and expensive looking. We have 3 daughters, and all of their birthstones were accounted for in this assortment. It will make an excellent Christmas present--great bang for your buck. Each pair comes individually boxed and the stones are clear and sparkly!!"
1,"These are really awesome 5 stud set that you can find, for that price - its a steal. Beautifully set. One of the best gifting idea."
1,"I bought this pretty set of earrings as a gift for a friend, and when they arrived very promptly and in a nice presentation case, I was well impressed. The recipient is very happy with these earrings, all of which she wears. This set is outstanding value for the money."
0,"These earrings are very nice for the price, however they are much bigger than I expected. I gave these as a gift to my girlfriend, but with two piercings on her ear lobes, there isn't enough room for one pair of these and any other earring. For those with just one piercing, this makes a very nice gift."
1,My husband bought them for me and I just love them. I just pop on the ones that match my outfit best and instantly feel more together. They're cut surprising nicely for the price.
0,"These earrings were supposed to be gifts for family, but I sent them back as the backings were not very tight and since the gemstones are set so high and in such substantial settings, they would become loose in my earlobe and always looked odd, like they could fall out at any moment. Beautiful stones, lovely fancy silver work, but they stick out of the lobe too much for me and the backs can't really support the weight."
0,"The earrings are beautiful but way too large for my small earlobes. The earrings do sag, but this is easily solved by using the disk-like earring backs that come with other earrings. The posts bend easily and the earrings protrude quite far from the ear due to the setting. One thing I disliked was that when the head is turned slightly, all you can see is the side of the setting - the stone is best viewed directly from the front. The stones are very beautiful and having the different shaped cuts for each type was nice. The fancy silver setting is also nice. They are a great value for the quality product received. However, I have returned the earrings and will look for something a bit smaller."
1,"This is such a nice set - I wear a different pair everyday. My only disappoint in them is the size - I was hoping to wear them in the top of my double pierced ears - but I can't because they are TOO BIG. I have gotten so many compliments on them. Yes, you can break them up and give them out as gifts. They would make GREAT gifts. But you will need to order 2 sets, because you will want to keep a set for yourself.I tell everyone where I got them from!"
1,"they are really nice earrings. you would expect earrings like that to be more,but they are not and they are very nice,thank you"
1,"When my amazon package arrived, I was excited. When I opened it up, I was delighted. Each pair of earrings was individually boxed. Yeah, as if I would share these beauties with anyone, I mean seriously. They are exquisite, sizable stones and look lovely on. I bought these as a gold box deal, but I would have happily paid more than the every day price. You cannot go wrong with these. If you're the generous type, they make a terrific gift :o)"
1,"I ordered these when they were 35 on Gold Box and I am so happy I did! They are all beautiful and I am amazed at how they sparkle! The Blue Topaz is very light, when compared to the black box I thought maybe it was a Cubic Zirconia, but once removed from the black I could see that it was blue. And even though it's a pale blue the sparkle in it is amazing, so it's one of my favorites! I think the Citrine is my least favorite, I think because of the rectangular shape it seems larger than the others and less dainty/feminine. I had the intention to give away some of these and keep only a couple.. but I am definitely keeping the Peridot, Amethyst and Blue Topaz ones for myself! I may give the Garnet to my mother, mainly because I don't wear reds, and I expect she will think that it cost MUCH more than it actually did! These are BEAUTIFUL earrings! Also, I have no problems with them drooping in my ears at all!"
1,"How lovely! I am so pleased with the quality, clarity and size of these Sterling Silver earrings. It is difficult to select a favorite because they are all beautiful. The colors are both clear and brilliant. I had no trouble wearing them and look forward to wearing them with many different clothing choices. I keep them in myVitaminder Pill Case Stackerso I can easily see which one I want to wear. These 5 sets of earrings are one 'Gem Of A Deal'! ~ Mrs. B."
1,This is a great little set of earrings! The stones look nice and the silver is sparkly. I got them a few days ago and I'm having a fun time mixing and matching them with my outfits. This is an awesome deal and you definitely get your money's worth.Note
1,"I bought this 5-pack of earrings for my girlfriend when it was on sale for about 75% off. I'm no expert, but the studs seemed to be of high quality and the gemstones were bigger than I thought they would be. My only regret is that I gave her all five sets at once, instead of gifting them one at a time! Anyway, she loves them. I would definitely recommend these studs."
1,"These earrings are my new favorites! The stones are beautifully matched in generous size, color and shape. The well-polished, silver basket settings accent each stone beautifully, and the posts are straight and sturdy. I do make a point to push the backing up snug to support the weight of the stones. My ear lobes are not particularly thin, so I don't find drooping to be problematic. If this were a problem, then I'm sure earring backs with supportive, plastic disks would work well."
1,"Pierced gemstone stud earrings are beautiful. The colored stones are large, and the silver settings are beautiful. They are exactly as described, and were a wonderful Christmas gift for my mother-in-law! Excellent quality!"
0,"This is a great idea, the band itself is nice - the little sliders are crap. The whole thing isn't worth more than $3 max. You have to be very careful with the sliders as they snap easily. Its nice that the band comes with an extra set, but after a week of using [and being VERY careful and gentle since i proceeded to purchase even after reading the reviews] both sliders snapped, i've already had to use the spare set. Perhaps if the company made them out of metal or found another way to accomplish the same slider/marker idea, it would be a better product. I got this because i really liked the band part of it, i didn't want any fancy bead bracelet. Heck, maybe i'll design one and make my fortune!"
1,This is a pretty and lovely simple necklace..The pic is prettier than the actual procuct because the chain is so dark But it is still nice
1,I have a pair of black metal earrings with dark blue sapphires in them and have always wanted to have a necklace to match. This one matches perfectly and looks so expensive and elegant!
1,"Given as a birthday present to my wife, she loved it and now she thinks I actually have taste!"
1,Great mirror for craft shows! I bought 2 and have been very pleased with them.
0,"The price is reasonable as compared to mall stores, but it is not in the same league as even the stock items, those chain's carry. Because of the small size of the stones one can not see all of the dirt each one has. However the color was ok and the stones fairly matched. None were milky. The gold setting has a sizable amount of cut outs so it is not a solid setting. Again as with the stones, most people will not notice it on first blush. So although cheaper than the mall stores, it is less of a product. But overall, the things done to make it less of a product, probably will not be noticed."
1,"My granddaugher really loved this braclet. It fit my newborn great granddaughter. I had a problem finding one that was not too big, and this one fit just fine. I will surely be shopping Amazon.com again for things for my great granddaughter. Thank you Amazon.com."
1,I was so pleased with this little shower gift for a co-worker that is expecting a baby girl. Everyone loved it. It was the hit of the party and I can't wait to see her wear it. All little ladies should start out with pearls!
1,"4-5mm Freshwater cultured pearl baby braclet. It was big hit, her mom loved it. She is 10 months old and it fit perfect."
0,"This little pearl bracelet is just too sweet. My tiny little granddaughter wore it for Easter Sunday and it just fit her perfectly. It will probably not fit for long because it is very tiny but it was perfect for her little wrist. It is only 4"" long so I probably should have bought something that was a bit longer but it was perfect for the occasion and will be a great little keepsake."
0,"The ring is gorgeous, but it looks a bit cheaper than the one in the picture. It's still pretty much what I was expecting, and it's pretty durable- An overall good product."
0,"This ring is NOT sold as pictured. My best friend has been wanting a Claddagh ring for years so this was supposed to be a wonderful Christmas present. Though it arrived on time, the ring was HORRIBLE! Tarnish marks are everywhere, the ring was obviously not polished because the edges are sharp, there are only three fingers, not the desired and realistic four, and the crown is bent to a 45 degree angle. I am taking it back and very upset by the product all together."
0,"It didn't really look like the picture at all and it looks kind of thin. It's still really pretty and my girlfriend liked it so that was a plus. It did arrive in a timely fashion but the part about it shipping within 24 hours is a lie. Overall, I'm satisfied with this ring."
1,"Don't let the price fool you this is an amazing piece of jewelry, very beautiful, made my girlfriend cry. BUY THIS JEWELRY, and for that matter, buy whatever Peora has for sale. QUICK shipping, very careful packing. Thank you so much, Peora!"
1,This the ring and I saw it in gold and diamonds but you know what Now that I see it in silver I had to buy it and yes I love it. I will only use it to go out .This is one ring for my collection. and the price is amazing I will say this you wont regret it..Its Beautiful. Buy it you love it..
0,"My mother had been wanting something to show the birthstones of both her children, her son-in-law, and her granddaughter that could easily have more birthstones added to it later as her family grows. This piece was perfect and also both attractive and novel. The only problem (as another customer has pointed out) is that the birthstones are too small for the large locket, so they end up just jumbled together at the bottom. My husband suggested using super glue, so I tried that and it worked. Once I glued the relevant gems (top face glued to the inside of the front of the locket), they stayed in place and were all perfectly visible. I don't know how the glue will affect the silver in the future, but without having the gems visible, this pendant was pointless to me."
0,This necklace is not silver at all. I don't even believe it is gold. My girlfriend went in the shower with it once and it turned this nasty gold-purple color. It is pretty on screen and it was the day we got it. Then it didn't even arrive on time. It is not worth 10 bucks. Such a piece of junk. I wish I could give it no stars. The way it clasps is a pain to the gems are so small they often get caught in it.
1,"Its the thought counts and I bought this for my mother in law! When I opened it, I was very impressed. For the price that I paid, I thought it would look a little cheaper but it feels heavy and looks pretty. I picked out the stones of her kids and started putting them in the locket. Although i wanted to be careful as not to break the necklace so I was careful when opening the locket. Although I found that I was having a hard time opening it. I realized later that you had to take off the chain for the locket to fully open all the way. Once I did that I put her kids stones in there and tried to close it. It didnt snap shut like I expected so I started to read the little paper that came with it. I realized that I had bought the smaller locket and the smaller locket can only only four stones when the bigger locket can hold fifteen. I was worried because she has five kids. So I tried to put them all in there anyways and after I shut it as much as I could, I put the chain back on it. I realized that when the chain is on the locket, none of the stones can fall out so I was very excited that I made all five fit in there afterall! I loved it so much I went online and bought one more small locket and another large locket for two other family members:)"
0,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she really likes it. I like the idea of the necklace but it hardly seems worth 70 bucks. It's a good gift for mothers and grandmothers but price should definitely decrease or the quality should increase. Overall it was okay.
1,"A Heavy,stylish and glittering piece of men jewelry!I like the quality;it's more than 1cm wide and has a strong silver lobster claw and it really looks GOOD!Though,I have to say it's not meant to be worn on very bright skins.And,finally I've gotta say u have to buy a holster for it cause the package doesn't contain one!"
0,"I really looked forward to this ring but after over a month of no product, no customer service, and no money, I gave up waiting. I bet the ring is beautiful, but I wouldn't know. I do know that I will NEVER order from Silvermoon Jewelry ever again. I recommend that you don't either. I know shipments can get lost but the fact that they have not answered a single one of my numerous e-mails shows what a terrible business this is. I would rate 0 stars, but this isn't possible."
1,"I loved it. My daughter is a dancer so I thought I would buy her something to reflect her passion. It is a pretty set of dancers, in various poses which are lightweight, in a black color and are very elegant. My daughter hangs some of her jewelry on them but uses them more for decoration."
1,These little earring holder dancers are adorable. I love them. The only way to make them better would be if they were sightly taller for those longer dangling earrings.
0,"Obviously, I purchased this item as it represents my Alma Mater. It arrived and instead of a sturdy polished piece of jewelry, it was very thin and the back of the charm was rough and unfinished. I would have gladly paid more for a better designed charm that I could wear proudly. I will mention this to the Wellesley Alumnae Association to address the product. Also, I specifically informed the vendor that I will be wearing it as a charm and instead of a necklace attachment(bale), I required a lobster clasp. They agreed and sent it as a pendant regardless of my request.It would probably be simpler if I took it to a jeweler and have it modified for the intended use. The designer is peddling poorly crafted products and the vendor should make sure that each order is delivered as ordered."
1,"This is the 3rd ring I bought while searching for a new wedding band w/my husband and it will be the last. It is absolutely beautiful! Mine also has a slight imperfection around the inlay, one or two lines are not perfectly straight. But you'd have to look for it to notice and it doesn't bother me. Like the other reviewer said, it means it's handmade, which I love. The ring is stunning and I can't stop admiring it."
0,"There is not a whole lot to this diamond. The picture is an incredibly large-sized zoom of the diamond. The I2-I3 clarity is mediocre - this will translate into a tiny sparkle. Even for an incredibly low price, it would be best to invest in a 1/3 or 1/2 ct diamond for $200 more and save yourself the trouble of wasting $50-100 altogether. Essentially, this necklace will disappoint every expectation.If you're a guy and you want to impress your girlfriend/wife/fiancee with a simple gift to see her smile, DO NOT buy this diamond. She will open the box expecting something half-decent only to be stunned by the minute size. She will then continue to squint her eyes, bring the box closer to her face, and force a smile. You do not want the pity kiss that is to follow. This diamond is not the gift you want to give to make her day. Instead, save the cash you would spend, take her out to somewhere nice for dinner, watch a new release in the movie theaters, and give her a massage when you get back home. She'll love it infinitely more than this jewel. You might even save a couple bucks in the process.For the ladies, I would recommend saving the cash spend on this necklace to buy a larger gem necklace. For the winter holidays, Blue Topaz is very stunning and for the same price, you can get a decent 1/2-1 ct Blue Topaz necklace with a great design in 14k white gold."
0,"Dont buy this necklace. I purchased this necklace as a gift for my ritzy grandmother from my kids thinking it would be nice, yet inexpensive...I was wrong with both. Its too tiny, I thought for sure when I saw it that there must be some kind of mistake. ANd for the price I paid, I wouldnt pay $10 for this necklace. I would have returned it if I would have gotten in it with-in 30 days, but I am overseas with my family and another family memeber shipped it over here to us. So, I am out of luck with returning it...but dont buy this, NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Amazon has definetely deceived the customer with the picture of this necklace, should be on a model to see the actual size. Lesson learned and passed on!"
0,"WOW, i was so deceived by the picture. It was probably pictured with a a camera that zooms in as if you were looking into a microscopic lens. If I were you, I would look up a size chart before buying any jewelry online. It was my own fault that I didn't look it up.The diamond was so small that a single rice grain is probably a little larger than the diamond. And the chain that comes with it is probably the same size as a thin thread. This gift was supposed to be for my mother, but now I will give it to my baby sister since it fits more for children.I have never been so disappointed with my buys from Amazon, but I will probably not buy anymore jewelry online again. Lesson learned."
0,"The old addage that if it looks too good to be true it probably is applies here. When I opened the box I could not even see it at first! Whisper thin, the diamond no bigger than the head of a pin, when I lay it against my skin, it vanished. My fist reaction was ""they have to be kidding"". I returned it."
1,"I absolutely love this necklace. I've worn it every single day for the last four months straight. The diamond is so clear and it really sparkles. I wear my necklace when I sleep, exercise and shower without worrying about it breaking or turning my skin green. Its great by itself or layered with other necklaces. 1/10th of a karat is very small but the diamond shines brilliantly. I have received a lot of complements on this necklace."
0,"You can barely see the diamond, the setting is most of the display, bought it for my wife, sad when it got here and she opened it... this is really really tiny, and the chain is the thinest chain I've ever seen..."
0,....... if the sandal had not come off....and is now lost
1,"As a person with auburn hair, I find that copper jewelry sets off my coloring. These earrings are exactly as described. They are dramatic without being overwhelming , and are appropriate for any occasion. The hammered effect is attractive and they are lightweight. Artistry in a less expensive metal is rare, and these earrings are well crafted."
1,"These beauties are light and lovely, just what I was looking for. They DO tarnish with time, however, but are easy to brighten with a bit of polish and a soft cloth."
1,Radiant Cut Smoky Quartz Pendant Sterling SilverThe product was shipped timely and packaged very well. The quality is good. I am very happy with my purchase and the company has good quality jewelry. I only wished the pendant was a little larger. However i was able to buy a ring and this piece matched it perfectly along with earrings purchased separately too.
0,I bought this ring for my girlfriend and I was very upset and so was I. I did not pay 46.90 dollars for a ring that I could buy from a 50 cent machine in a burger joint. I expected better material and have it be worth my money. On top of that the ring was not even as described! It was as if it were another ring! It had this dotted designe around the edge and the black areas in the back was not even black it was ALL silver! I'm returning this thing.
1,"I love this ring! It was very reasonably priced, and is very cute. I bought it for myself for my birthday, and I wear it every day! Perfect gift or just to treat yourself"
1,"Amazingly beautiful packaging! It was so easy to open, then wrap just as it was! I can't imagine how some vendors would ship!"
0,It is very difficult to buy gold via the web because the pictures do not show actual size. felt that the item was over priced. It was very thin and the baby snatched it and broke it in the first use.
0,"$12.50 to ship is to much, 3.50 or 4.00 ok not 12.50. They should post the shipping charge. If I would have known I would have looked elcewhere."
1,I was looking for this exact product and had great difficulty finding it. It met my needs perfectly and was delivered very quickly. Perfect
1,"I needed this for Valentine's Day and I wasn't disappointed. Their courteous and friendly customer service made me feel like a person and not a number. The Opal was better than described and after shopping around, it was the best bargain that I found. My girl lit up when she saw this and yours will too. I love shopping here!"
1,"This is a very elegant setting. Smoky quartz tends to be too dark to reflect much light, but it's still very pretty (Peora's smoky quartz has been good quality) and looks quite nice against brown or other fall colors."
1,"After looking at many Peridot pendants I ordered this one as a gift. I assumed it would be nice but was not prepared for just how nice the stone would be.. The stone is clear, bright, and crisp. The color is a bright light green almost a match for the picture. The stone actually looks better than the picture. Of course every stone is different so your mileage may vary, but I would but from this vendor again based on the quality of the product."
1,"I had a hard time believing this thing would actually work. I thought ""there has to be some sort of catch here"" because this is pretty cheap as far as jewelry cleaners go and the technology isn't copied by too many. To me, all of this typically adds up to some sort of gimmick. This is just simply not true with this ionic cleaner. It really does do as good a job as is stated on plenty of websites and reviews. It cleans everything. And it does it very, very well and efficiently. This has been used to clean a lot of jewelry (cheap to very expensive and all types of metals and stones) and it does the job well every single time.The directions state to use only one cycle (30 seconds) or less to clean a lot of types of jewelry and it warns that going over this time limit could cause damage. I strongly disagree. I've put silver through 5-6 cycles (rinsing in between) just to test this and there were zero ill effects.All in all, this is a great product that does outstanding work and is not any type of gimmick whatsoever. It does an outstanding job and I'm really stumped as to why this product hasn't become more mainstream than it appears to be. That fact escapes me completely. It is much cheaper than professional sonic cleaners but does the same work and provides the same quality. Strange. In fact, if I had to wager a guess, I think there is about $20 in materials to build one of these. It's the type of reaction that does the job and this one is simple but effective. Sonic is more expensive because sonic waves are harder to create - and they are a mechanical job. The ionic cleaners have no mechanical parts - just the basic solution and an electrical current.Anyway, it's great. I would recommend it to anyone."
0,"This is a case of ""lower your expectations"". Compared to other products of this nature, this is an excellent product. I felt the item description was untrue to its nature since it does not appear to be made from real leather - more like a plastic that is trying to look like leather. The construction is good and, from afar, it looks decent. I remain undecided as to whether the jewelry will make the case look expensive - or whether the case will make the jewelry look cheap..."
0,"I purchased 2 of these , one for a gift and the first week the charm came off and was lost. The metal of the ring that holds the charm is so thin it does not stay together, it should be soldered close. Other Pugster products have been fine."
1,one of just a handful of online sources for men's rings with smoky quartz setting. Delivery was very fast and the ring was of excellent quality. Really turning heads in this area.
1,These earrings are exactly what I've been searching for
0,"These earrings are inadequately described on Amazon's site. Perhaps hsiu jade is a particular color of jade, but I'm not familiar with it and there was no color description offered on Amazon. In the pictures posted on the site they appear to be black, which was what I was expecting to receive. How wrong I was. The earrings I received were a dark brownish/green color that resembled what my dog leaves behind when I take her for a walk. Were they black, as shown on the site (or any other acceptable shade) they would be lovely, but no way was I going to wear petrified dog poo earrings. Back they went."
1,"I recently purchased this necklace and I am very pleased. I got many compliments. My own mother asked to wear it for a wedding shower and she got compliments on it too. It shines best in natural sun light. You'll feel good wearing this and never grow bored of it. I anticipate putting it on before I leave the house. Part of why it shines so well is because of how clean the cuts on the little circles are (not sure what the correct term or word is). Augustina is an incredibly great company, and although they are big into pearls the necklaces are for both men and women. Buy this item for yourself or give it to someone as a gift(just imagine the expression on their face when you hand it over to them). Just make sure you know the thickness and length you want."
1,"Every woman needs a couple of basic jewelry wardrobe pieces. Thes are very pretty, and there is no worry about the pearl becoming unglued from the gold post. Love em!"
1,These are beautiful earrings. I bought many of these Millefiori Earrings in different colors and they are all very well hand crafted and gorgeous.
1,"Always a little skeptical about buy jewelry over the internet, but these earrings were great. Exactly as depicted. I would gladly order from this company again. Great price, wonderful product."
1,These earrings are a nice addition to my collection
0,"I thought I could sacrifice quality for size but that was a mistake. I bought these for myself for my birthday along with a pendant that was H-I and with fewer inclusions. Next to the pendant these earrings looked even more dull and of poor quality. I ended up returning the earrings and spending a little more on better quality. If you can, I'd recommend spending the money on a better cut with greater clarity. If this is the upper limit of how much you'd like to spend get a smaller size, better cut & clarity."
1,These earrings were well worth the money. I almost wish I had bought a second pair at that time because the price has gone up since.
1,"After hearing about the healing properties of rose quartz I found this pendant. It's very beautiful, goes with almost every outfit and I always wear it.Shipping was really fast and item as good as it does on picture"
0,"I admit that the dimensions are listed clearly on the website and that I should have been more careful in ordering an item online but the chain that it came with was just ""cheap"". It felt like it would break if there was any preasure on it. Needless to say, I was not satisfied with the quality of the item. Although, the pendant itself was not too bad (although tiny), the chain that it comes with is terrible."
1,"i got this from my fiance as a little gift. i love it. it's cute, dainty, and has a little bling to it. i wear it almost everyday. can't go wrong with it."
1,I want a basic earring pendant set that I can wear with casual or dress. This fits the bill perfectly. The size is not too big or small for any occasion. The full cylinder gives it added richness and depth. Love the set.
1,Beautiful earrings and shipped right on time. Great value. I love getting a good price for a great looking product.
1,"Great value for the price (a Lightning Deal). I'm SUPER fussy, and I can't fault these earrings in any way."
1,Love these! Just beautiful. Not dinky at all. One of my favorite &#34;go to&#34; earrings. I have had many compliments on them.
1,"these are very pretty little earrings. They're a little bit smaller that I thought they were, but thats ok, they still look very nice."
1,"I received these earrings (along with the matching necklace) for Christmas. The picture doesn't do them justice. The quality is great and they are really beautiful! They have a really lovely shape and they are just the perfect size. They are noticeable without being gaudy, and they are so light that you really can't even tell you're wearing them. I really love them!Here is the link for the matching necklace:Sterling Silver Filigree Oval Pendant, 18"""
1,"Beautiful and lightweight earrings. They match and look like Brighton earrings. For those that want to know, this design is considered Bali and filigree. I have a beatiful bracelet from QVC - Artisan crafted Jewelry that matches pretty well."
1,"I am very pleased with my filigree oval drop earrings. They complement dressy clothes with their filigree look; and can be worn with casual clothes as well.Once I ordered the earrings, they were shipped and received within days.I am truly delighted!"
1,"OK, just got these hand delivered to me about 5 minutes ago. They are really nice workmanship and shiny not at all a dull silver like the picture. I took a leap of faith and ordered these for my mom for this christmas, yeah i want a pair for myself. they are really nice. Shes going to LOVE these!"
1,These are so pretty and shiny! Picture doesn't do them justice. They are exactly as described. Can't beat the price and free shipping with Prime!I highly recommend.
1,I guess I was one of the lucky ones to receive these earrings before they discontinued them. It appears that they are no longer available on Amazon and there is no expected date for them to return.These earrings are very fun to wear and not heavy at all. I like jewelry that is unique and these fit the bill. I think I'm going to check to see if there's a matching necklace.
1,I gave these to my mom for Mothers Day and she seemed very pleased with them. She has arthritis in her hands so this type of earring is much easier for her to use than a post with the small back. She said she has received many compliments on them from people she has seen.
1,"I was looking for a pair of earrings that are classy and can potentially be worn on an every day basis. This pair hits the mark. The earrings are solid, obviously of good quality. They are not too big and not too small. The silver is nice and shiny, and they look great on. I can see wearing these with many outfits. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, and just purchased the matching pendant."
1,"I wanted a beautiful silver chain with a narrow end that I could slip through my pendant. Perfect. Nice length, color and thickness."
1,Just received this today and it is very well made and I will order some more later on.Highly recommend.
1,This item came faster than the estimated shipping which I am very happy about. Plus the necklace was just astonishing! It's so beautiful! and looks like it was way more expensive! I'm way more than pleased with this item( I even want to get one for myself).
1,I bought this chain to wear with a silver cross. I was a little apprehensive since the price was so reasonable. What a great decision it was! It has a beautiful luster to it. I've been wearing it everyday for over a month or two and it still looks new. I'm ordering another shorter one soon. Great company to do business with. Don't be afraid to order from them. You actually get what see. Very fast shipping too! I will be checking out the earring selection after I order another necklace. Shop with confidence.
1,"I wore my new sterling silver neck chain for the first time yesterday. I received 0ne compliment after another all day. I was so impressed by the quality and beauty of my new jewelry. I could not believe the price, very reasonable and the delivery service was speedy. Thank you I will be ordering again. You sure take the work out of shopping."
1,"I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early. The seller discribed it well in the write up so I knew exactly what I was geting and was happy on the transaction."
1,"The Italian Sterling Silver necklace was more than I thought it would be. I wear it with my white gold pendants & you can't tell the difference. It has a lot of brillance & shine. I would recommend this necklace to anyone that doesn't want to pay the high price of a 24"" gold necklace, you won't be disappointed."
1,"My mother in-law loves blue topaz, peridot, and citrine. She has numerous separate pieces. I purchased the necklace to match the other jewelry items that she owns. I was not disappointed. They stones are clear and shine great! I know she will be pleased. I think I made a great purchase for a great price and quick delivery."
0,"I loved this ring when I received it. It was absolutely beautiful. It fit well and looked lovely.Then I put it on. The main gemstone (Garnet) was loose, so I was going to send it back to be replaced. I went to put it back in the box and one of the side-stones (Cubic Zirconia) fell out of its setting.I immediately went to send it back; I contacted customer service numerous times to get information, and they never once understood what I was asking.I would not recommend. The quality is poor, the service at this company is lacking, and though it is not an expensive item, it costs more than it is worth. It is a shame, too, as it was a beautiful ring."
1,"For the money, this is an absolutely gorgeous ring. The garnet is a clear, bright red and nicely faceted. I wear it every day and rarely take it off and it has not turned or tarnished at all and I've received MANY compliments!"
0,"This is such a pretty ring. Received it quickly and love how it sparkles. However, at least one stone is rattling around in it's setting. It's just a matter of time before it comes out. The 30-day return policy (needs to be IN THEIR HANDS before 30 days are up from time of purchase) just doesn't cut it. So attractive but just not well-made. You buy cheap - you get cheap."
1,I purchased this necklace as a gift for my Mother (who is very picky about the jewelry she wears) and she absolutely LOVES it and wears it all the time! The service and fast shipping from Gem Avenue was fabulous!
1,"When I first saw these I really liked them. After having bought them I must say, I still really like them. If you're looking for something to take your look to that next look, try em. You'll be surprised."
0,"I had expected these to be small stud earrings. They are about 1/2 inch in size and cover almost my entire earlobe. My teenagers told me they look like ""old lady"" earrings."
0,"The pearl doesn't look real, has a pinkish hue, and is much larger than in the picture. It overpowers the garnet. Overall, the pendant is not attractive. The cord is pretty but I cannot swap out the pendant to wear any other pendant on the cord. I returned this item the same day that I received it."
1,"These are great everyday earrings and you will not be disappointed if you buy them. This is not a negative - just a caution; the earrings are pretty heavy and if you have elongated holes in your ears, these may weigh them down."
1,These earrings are simple yet elegant! They give me a polished look. I do not have to wear a necklace with these. They are complete in themselves. I wear these one day and then the hooped Swirl Collections earrings I ordered at the same time the next day. I ordered these when they were on sale for $29. They are worth the regular price but wait for a sale and you will be glad you did.
1,Great ServiceI depend on quality when I order from you and I have never been disappointed. I often order and have the item sent from there directly to one of my children.This pendent was a birthday gift for my daughter in law and she loved it.Thanks so much!Jeane Jones
1,The earrings arrived sooner than predicted. They were as described and in great condition. The lady who received them as a gift was very pleased.
0,I bought this ring in the store with a very good color (F) I could see a visible white inclution in the store but only when I looked from the side. I even went out into the mall to look at outside store light. When I got outside there were two huge inclutions in the center stone even visable from a distance and a black inclution in a side stone. SO bottom line...you get what you pay for. Also I saw other rings in the store the same style and price but were L-M color.
0,"Fulfill its purpose but clearly has the looks of something made cheaply which makes your gift look less valuable, so decent product."
0,"I bought these not to put a necklace in but i got my friend concert tickets and i wanted to give them to her in a different way so overall the products is perfect for necklaces but the tickets were too wide to fit in the case. The only suggestion i have is to list the dimensions in the product description. Other than it not working for my intended purpose, i felt the quality was good and it gets the job done."
0,"I would give this negative stars if I could. I could of made this myself for less money. Once I saw how cheaply this gift box was constructed I quickly put it back in the box and returned it for a full refund. It is not at all how it is described or pictured. It is constructed of colored corrugated cardboard. There are dents, holes and glue marks everywhere. I am still in shock how much this cost me! It resembled something my child would of made for me in kindergarten as a project for Mother's Day. I have posted some REAL pictures under the product page so you can see for yourself."
0,"I purchase boxes for handmade jewelry, but had to toss these, would be a loss to return. They looked like dime store finds and made my jewlery look cheap."
1,"Beautiful! I always wanted Tiffany Diamonds By the yard, but that costs WAY more than my budget allows. This necklace from Ross-Simmons is a wonderful look alike. It is white gold, 20"" with 7 bezel set diamonds. I love it and I have not taken it off since the day I got it! Don't hesitate, don't shop around, buy this one, it is perfect!"
1,"I bought this ring for myself while Sajen jewelry was on sale for 30% off. After getting the ring, I added several more of these beautiful pieces to my wish list."
1,I wanted a little sparkle for my right hand and this is just perfect! I've received many compliments...a great item at a fantastic price!
0,"I ordered two of these rings to wear as stackers, but I should have known better than to expect quality at the price that I paid. The ""diamonds"" are so full of visible black inclusions that the rings look grey."
1,"After a my fiancee and I searched everywhere for a wedding band for me, I finally found this one on Amazon. It needs to be sized slightly, as I am a size 4 ring size, but it sparkles and matches perfect with my engagement ring. It is nice with the diamond, or it's great to wear by itself.I definitely recommend this ring!"
0,"I bought this ring because it looked like it would match my engagement ring perfectly judging by the picture.We got it in the mail and it was a cute ring, but looked NOTHING like the picture.The diamonds are not aligned, they are placed on crookedly, the metal is bent, curved, and has dips in it, and some of the prongs are sticking up.Like I said, cute ring, very sparkly, but very cheaply made."
1,I bought this for my three year old niece and she loves this jewelry box way more than any of the jewelry that came with it. She adores just watching the ballerina twirl. She's pretty rough with it and it's not broken or scratched yet so I that makes it a durable toy. This was the prettiest ballerina jewelry box I could find on the net and in stores.
0,"My granddaughter just loves it. It's not the best quality but the price is right. And, at 4yrs old - not bound to last anyway. It's perfect for her now."
1,I bought this for my 6 year old niece & she adores it. She loves ballerinas & the color is very pretty on the box. It is big enough for her little amount of jewelry that she has now. She will eventually grow out of it but I think it should last her quite awhile. I think any girl would love this!
0,"The jewelry box was a nice gift for two sisters first ballet recital. It is not very sturdy and the key that turns the music on the back would come off. Later we found out that the girls were turning it the wrong way. Once they learn the proper way to turn it, it was OK. Nevertheless, it was the highlight of the party."
0,"This jewelry box is very sweet in it's appearance and it's design. However, the material is a joke!I was trying to find a jewelry box for my daughter for Christmas. I had actually ordered another box off Amazon (different design and manufacturer) and returned it due to a couple of different reasons (completely unrelated to these!). I only had a couple of days before Christmas to order one for my daughter after returning the other one and I was trying to find either a blue or purple one.So after my first failed attempt, I ordered this one. The outer ""foil"" (for lack of a better description) is a nice design. It's somewhat shimmery/metalicy if that gives you an idea.It does play Swan Lake. The sound is ok; it's what you would expect for the cost.Another reviewer had commented on it being made out of particle board or something of the liking. I decided to try it anyway. They couldn't have been more accurate. It is definitely like a cheap NON-wooden/durable material. You can feel it ""giving"" underneath. I can't imagine this will hold up for too long.Again, the design is really sweet for your little girl, but the quality is pretty much at the opposite side of the spectrum!*We did end up keeping it as it wasn't a small fortune and it was literally right before Christmas and I didn't really have any other options!"
1,"My little 3-year old loves jewelry. She is also fancinated by the ballerina/music boxes in the Little Mermaid Video and Tinkerbelle Video. I wanted to find a jewelry box just like this one, twirling ballerina, music, inexpensive. She loves it and I love watching her with it!"
0,"Came to me with ballerina in pieces and rattling around the box, then when opened smelled strongly of mildew. I had to glue the ballerina together and spray it with perfume and air it out. I would have sent it back if it weren't so close to Christmas."
1,"I bought this for my daughters 4th birthday.The outside of the box isvery beautiful. The inside is what you would expect from a childs jewelry box-but does not look cheap or flimsy.Overall the product seems sturdy and well made.The ballerina doll spins fine and the music box has great sound. I was surprised actually how clear it was.The ballerina is painted plastic and an adult might not be impressed by the paint job but it is more than beautiful enough for a little girl-this IS,after all a childs music box. With room for probably 3 or 4 little girl necklaces.Mine came with a very small nick in it but i still give it 5 stars. It's a beautiful little gift for anylittle girl."
1,I purchased this for my 4year old goddaughter. Who currently takes ballet. She absolutely loves the box and i am very happy. She uses it for her little papers and earrings.
0,"I ordered the ballerina music box but received the Fairy equivalent instead. This was a mistake I could deal with, considering my daughter likes both, but I would, of course, prefer the one I had picked out. Upon opening the box I must agree with some reviewers that the figure is rather disappointing, but what bothered me more was that there was some sort of dust inside on the velvet. It rubbed off fairly easy, but left a still somewhat visible mark, which definitely takes away from the aesthetics, not to mention makes me wonder if it's even safe for my daughter. I will probably be returning this item, which frustrates me even more."
0,My granddaughter liked my music boxes when she visited my home so I purchased this one for her. I was a little dissapointed with the covering. I am looking forward to seeing her again soon and will be interested to see how the box is holding up. Maybe a little overpriced.
1,My daughter calls her grandma Grammy so happy to have found this and it was cheap! The pic doesn't do it justice a lot nicer then I though and the shipping was fast very happy
1,I received this ring and it exceeded my expectations. Just a beautiful and well crafted ring. Excellent quality.
1,I love this Ring. Made well and fills grat on my finger. I would recomend this ring to anybody looking for a non-flashy but badass skull ring.
1,"I bought this ring very recently and it's a nice shiny ring. The metal is high quality stainless steel. The skull on the front is small and understated, and is small enough that it does not draw attention. The ring otherwise is a silver band. For me they didn't have my size, so I bought the next size up and wear it on my middle finger, works great. The price for this ring also is a great deal. Stainless steel is usually hard to come by at such a great price."
0,"Unfortunately, the ring I received was a very distorted version of the one shown in the picture. The skull looks like Darth Vader. I'm so disappointed."
1,This ring is very well made and looks like it should cost a lot more! Even from a distance it's obvious that it's not 'junk' metal.
1,"The shipping was fast and great. When I received the ring I was very impressed with the packaging and with the ring itself. I was so happy with it that I had to give it to my financee immediately. He loved it and is wearing it all the time. The product was exactly how it was described and worth every penny. I was very, very impressed and happy."
1,I LOVE this ring! I wish I could get one in white gold with a few 2pt. diamonds in the horseshoes nail holes.This is the Most Beautiful Horseshoe Ring I've ever seen. ....I will always check with the Rich Peel Co. for anymore of my jewelry needs.
1,I ordered the Chinese coin necklace three days before Christmas and received it in time while paying for regular mail service. I really appreciated their quick response to my purchase. The necklace was great too!
0,"The way the post on the earring is it is almost impossible to get in ear. I have had pierced ears for 30 years and this is the first pair I could not get in my ears, and I finally got one in and I couldn't get it closed!!!! Very disappointed I wanted them!!!!!! Pam"
0,Why is this item advertised as 14K when it is actually 10k? Sounds like false advertising to me.
1,These earring are even prettier than their photo. They're one-of-a-kind and have recieved many compliments on them. I look forward to more unique finds from this vendor.
1,I gave this to my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. The pendant is just the right size for her and the stones accented it perfectly. Not to mention how friendly the Amazon merchant is to deal with.
1,"I am totally in love with this ruby pendant, I don't take it off at all! it's beautiful and stylish and very reasonable price too!"
1,I bought two of these as accent rings. They're great! The diamonds are subtle but still very sparkly and they show up great without being gaudy. I love this ring! Great buy!
1,It looks so gorgeous next to my engagement ring. I thought it was going to be thinner but to my surprise it has the perfect width. I have had it for a couple of days so I still can't say how durable it will be but it looks like it was well made. I highly recommend this for the price!
1,"I love this ring. I got the yellow gold ring which has the white gold prongs. It is very sparkly and dainty which I like. It compliments my wedding set and doesn't compete with it. A great deal! Although, I bought it for $99.99 when it was on sale."
1,"My husband got me this ring in yellow gold for the holidays because I wanted something to go with my wedding ring. This ring is everything the other reviews say it is! It fits perfectly on my finger with my wedding ring, looks beautiful and the diamonds are well-set, well-faceted and very sparkly. I'm 5'3"" and it looks perfect.If you're looking for a smaller ring that makes a wonderful statement, I can't recommend this one enough :)"
1,"I've already had to return several rings on Amazon due to them being nothing like the picture or just feeling cheap and flimsy. This band has really made my day. It is a thinner band which is exactly what I wanted, but it sparkles almost better than my engagement ring. It feels solid and not cheap; the diamonds look amazing. If you're hesitant like I am, then know that this ring looks JUST like you think it will. I also appreciate the fast shipping."
1,"I will admit, I was skeptical about buying a ring online without seeing it in person first..But, this ring is absolutely stunning! The diamonds may be considered ""small"" for some, but they are a perfect size for me. This ring does not stick up very much either. It looks great with my solitaire and stacks perfectly with it. The diamonds are very sparkly as well! If you buy this ring, I do not think you will regret it."
1,"I received this as a gift, and I just love it. I like to pair it with my white gold cathedral style wedding ring. It enhances my beautiful wrapped wedding ring set without competing with it. Really does look like it should cost more."
1,"I boought this for my wife and she love it blood! Plus, Amazon gave me a discount which made me love it more..."
0,if this ring hadn't been warped i would have given it 5 stars for sure. but it arrived warped and with gold thicker on one side of the band than the other.the diamonds were sparkly and pretty and you couldn't beat the price.it was such a pain to have to send back and find something else locally...we would have rather had THIS ring.i will try again next time.
1,"My only wish is I had ordered 2 (one for each side of my engagement ring).I have 2 in diapers so have to watch what I spend. I lost my wedding band and engagement ring (a 1/2 carat princess cut) over 2 years ago and have been missing having a ring.The diamonds aren't as big as I would like, but it is beautiful. It sparkles beautifully. I would recommend this to others looking for a beautiful ring on a budget."
1,"I am very pleased with my purchase! This ring is very sweet and delicate, and it sparkles and shines. Lovely!"
1,Wow My Wife realy will love this ring when i give it to her this Christmas!!! I am hoping it gets me a little play to from the old lady!!
0,The ring it's self is beautiful. But while it says ZIRCON it is ZIRCONIA!!!!(there is a BIG difference) I confirmed this with the people at Sabrina Silver. While the ring is great and worth the price don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a different stone. Aside from that I am pleased. The stones are a little whiter than the picture but not to the point of making it a bad CZ.
0,"Pendant appeared as stated, Chain extremely knotted upon arrival which required a long delicate de-tangling effort. Chain itself was unacceptably thin. We ended up purchasing a separate thicker chain to improve both the looks and durability of the piece."
1,"Well, I don't wear them, however, my wife was very pleased with her Christmas present. If Mama's happy,everyone's happy. I would definitely endorse shopping on Amazon. In my case, my target was 14k white gold, diamond stud earings. I found them in all shapes, sizes and prices on Amazon. Very pleased."
1,I think this is the most beautiful ring I have ever seen and I wish it would become available again.
0,"I asked for this ring for my birthday because my friend has the same design and its gorgeous on her. When it arrived, I was extremely disappointed. The sizes of the stones were fine, a little on the small side, but the imperfections were obvious even to my untrained eye. The most disappointing thing was that it just didn't sparkle even in the sunlight. I was wearing a diamond band from Costco and it sparkles beautifully. There was an article on CNN about the differences between purchasing diamonds from Costco & Tiffany's and the conclusion was that you do get quality diamonds from Costco and its well worth it. At least with Costco, you can see the diamonds before hand. I love Amazon but I strongly don't recommend it for jewels. You just don't know what you're getting no matter how many reviews you read."
1,"Looks great and fits well. I wear it on my index finger, and just love it. Good quality, too. Last ring I bought turned my finger black, but this one is great. Would recommend it to anyone who likes black hills gold."
1,The ring arrived on time and appears to be good quality for the price. Our 15 yr old grand-daughter loved it.
1,Let's just say... I will be wearing this eternity band for an eternity. I LOVE IT! shipped very quickly and great for price.
0,"The ring itself is attractive and looks to be well made, but it is very small - much smaller than the picture makes it look. It looks like it is for a child. I have returned it."
0,Product is not worth the money. It is so small you can barely see it.
0,I was disappointed in this pendant. It is very small. I intended to give it to my adult daughter for Christmas but will be giving it to the teenager next door instead.
0,when i first saw on the website it looked big. i was disappointed to see its actual size. it was v v small and tiny pendant. i never expected it to be so small. so dont get carried away by looking at the picture. u need to have a real estimate of the size before u buy.
0,"It is pretty inexpensive, and it came in as advertised - I guess, except it still suprised me how thin the chain was (my wife likes that actually) and how small the pearl was (which was a turn off)."
1,"My fiancee and I bought this for her mother, who is a blonde and looks absolutely radiant in this necklace. It adds a perfect touch of class to any outfit, just like one of the previous reviewers said (thanks!).The 6.0-6.5 mm pearl size is perfect. I would not go smaller, especially since this is thirty five bucks.The chain is not itty-bitty as some have suggested. It's not a rope of gold, but it is proportioned well relative to the pearl.The setting for the pearl is nice"
1,"...I bought this for my daughter to stack with a citrine one, blue topaz one, and cz one. The stones are well matched, fairly clear and pretty bright. She is thrilled with it! Very good value especially on sale!!!"
0,"Definitevily need to buy 3 rings and wear them together, could be different stones or all 3 of the same, otherwise looks ""bare"". I wish the stones were a darker green. Worth it if it is on sale."
0,"This is a beautiful charm, but it is much smaller than I anticipated. The charm is actually smaller than the picture!"
